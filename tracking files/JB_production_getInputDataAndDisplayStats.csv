0,3722,21413,"One Star Over, a Planet That Might Be Another Earth - The NY Times",NY Times,Kenneth Chang,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Another Earth could be circling the star right next door to us. Astronomers announced on Wednesday that they had detected a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, the closest neighbor to our solar system. Intriguingly, the planet is in the star's “Goldilocks zone,” where it may be neither too hot nor too cold. That means liquid water could exist at the surface, raising the possibility for life. Although observations in recent years, particularly by NASA's Kepler   mission, have uncovered a bounty of   worlds throughout the galaxy, this one holds particular promise because it might someday, decades from now, be possible to reach. It's 4. 2   or 25 trillion miles, away from Earth, which is extremely close in cosmic terms. One astronomer likened it to a flashing neon sign. “I'm the nearest star, and I have a potentially habitable planet!” said R. Paul Butler, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science and a member of the team that made the discovery. Guillem   an astronomer at Queen Mary University of London and the leader of the team that made the discovery reported in the journal Nature, said, “We know there are terrestrial planets around many stars, and we kind of expected the nearby stars would contain terrestrial planets. This is not exciting because of this. The excitement is because it is the nearest one. ” Beyond the planet's size and distance from its parent star, much about it is still mysterious. Scientists are working off computer models that offer mere hints of what's possible: Conditions could be Earthlike, but they could also be hellish like Venus, or cold and dry like Mars. There is no picture of the planet, which has been designated Proxima b. Instead, Dr.   and his colleagues detected it indirectly, studying via telescope the light of the parent star. They zeroed in on clocklike wobbles in the starlight, as the colors shifted slightly to the reddish end of the spectrum, then slightly bluish. The oscillations, caused by the bobbing    motion of the star as it is pulled around by the gravity of the planet, are similar to how the pitch of a police siren rises or falls depending on whether the patrol car is traveling toward or away from the listener. From the size of the wobbles, the astronomers determined that Proxima b is at least 1. 3 times the mass of Earth, although it could be several times larger. A year on Proxima b  —   the time to complete one orbit around the star  —   lasts just 11. 2 days. Although the planet, lost in the glare of the star, cannot be viewed by current telescopes, astronomers hope to see it when the next generation is built a decade from now. And the planet's proximity to Earth gives hope that robotic probes could someday be zooming past the planet for a   look. A privately funded team of scientists and technology titans, led by the Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner and the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, have announced Breakthrough Starshot Initiative, a project to develop and launch a fleet of   spacecraft within two to three decades. Their proposed destination is the Alpha Centauri star system, which includes two larger, sunlike stars in addition to Proxima Centauri. “We will definitely aim at Proxima,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer who is the chairman of an advisory committee for Breakthrough Starshot. “This is like finding prime real estate in our neighborhood. ” This newly discovered planet is much closer to its parent star, about five million miles apart, than Earth is to the sun, 93 million miles. Even Mercury, the innermost planet of our solar system, is 36 million miles from the sun. While Proxima b might be similar to Earth, its parent star, Proxima Centauri, is very different from the sun. It is tiny, belonging to a class of stars known as red dwarfs, with only about 12 percent of the mass of the sun and about   the luminosity  —   so dim that it cannot be seen from Earth with the naked eye. Thus Proxima b, despite its closeness to the star, receives less warmth than Earth, but enough that water could flow on the surface. Whether the planet has liquid water or an atmosphere is “pure speculation at this point,” Dr.   said in a news conference. If the planet formed close to the star, it could be dry and airless, but it might also have formed farther out and migrated inward to its current orbit. It is also possible that the planet formed dry and was later bombarded by comets or   asteroids. “There are viable models and stories that lead to a viable Earthlike planet today,” Dr.   said. Even if it is habitable, scientists studying the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe spiritedly debate whether planets around these red dwarfs are a promising place to look. Small stars are more erratic, especially during their youth, and eruptions off the star's surface could strip away the atmosphere from such planets. Levels of   and other   radiation bombarding the planet would be 100 times that on Earth, the scientists said. The close orbit suggests that the rotation of the planet would probably be gravitationally locked by the star's pull. Just as the same side of the moon always faces Earth, one side of Proxima b is probably eternally bright, always facing the star, while the other is ever dark. Additional visible light observations further convinced the scientists that they were not being fooled by variations in the star itself erroneously mimicking the presence of a planet. The discovery was more than a decade and a half in the making. Michael Endl, an astronomer at the University of Texas and one of the authors of the Nature paper, peered at Proxima Centauri for eight years beginning in 2000, looking for hints of a planet. “At that time, I didn't see anything highly, highly significant,” Dr. Endl said in an interview. “Then we published our data and moved on. ” Later, Dr.   analyzing data from a different instrument on a different telescope, found inconclusive hints of a planet. He reached out to Dr. Endl to reanalyze the earlier data, and he also spearheaded the Pale Red Dot project, which tried to observe Proxima Centauri daily for two months earlier this year. The new observations clearly revealed the 11.  period of the planet, and the signal matched what Dr.   had suspected earlier. It also matched a signal that was hidden in the noise of Dr. Endl's data, which was lower in precision and observed Proxima Centauri once a week or so, not every day. There are hints of perhaps another planet, perhaps more, but those hints are still ambiguous, the scientists said. The discovery could provide impetus for   telescopes. Ruslan Belikov of the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. has proposed a small space telescope costing less than $175 million dedicated to the search for planets in Alpha Centauri. While it would not be powerful enough to spot Proxima b, its existence would give more confidence that terrestrial planets also orbit the two sunlike stars there. “It just raises the public awareness there's a new world just next door,” Dr. Belikov said. “It's a paradigm shift in people's minds. ”",False,"Another Earth could be circling the star right next door to us.

1,3748,21448,University of Chicago Strikes Back Against Campus Political Correctness - The NY Times,NY Times,"Richard Pérez-Peña, Mitch Smith and Stephanie Saul",2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"The anodyne welcome letter to incoming freshmen is a college staple, but this week the University of Chicago took a different approach: It sent new students a blunt statement opposing some hallmarks of campus political correctness, drawing thousands of impassioned responses, for and against, as it caromed around cyberspace. “Our commitment to academic freedom means that we do not support   trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual ‘safe spaces' where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own,” John Ellison, dean of students, wrote to members of the class of 2020, who will arrive next month. It was a    rebuke to the protests calling for limits on what kinds of speech should be condoned on campus, and who should be allowed to speak, that have rocked Yale, Wesleyan, Oberlin and many other colleges and universities in recent years. Some alumni, dismayed by the trend, have withheld donations from their alma maters. The Chicago letter echoed policies that were already in place there and at a number of other universities calling for “the freedom to espouse and explore a wide range of ideas. ” But its stark wording, coming from one of the nation's leading universities, and in a routine correspondence that usually contains nothing more contentious than a dining hall schedule, felt to people on all sides like a statement. Kevin Gannon, a history professor at Grand View University in Des Moines, dismissed the letter on his website as “a manifesto looking for an audience,” one that “relies on caricature and bogeymen rather than reason and nuance. ” The Heritage Foundation wrote on Facebook that the letter “will make you stand up and cheer. ” Other universities have made similar statements, but the message from Chicago is “clearer and more direct than I've seen,” said Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a leading critic of what it says are destructive speech restrictions at many campuses. “Sending a letter to freshmen is different than I've seen, at least in a long time, and certainly from a major university. ” Michael S. Roth, president of Wesleyan University, said the Chicago letter was, at least in part, a publicity stunt  —   “Gosh, is there any doubt?” he asked  —   and a way of “not coddling students, but coddling donors. ” Jeremy Manier, a University of Chicago spokesman, insisted there were no hidden motives behind the letter. And he said professors remained free, at their discretion, to use trigger warnings, the messages sometimes posted atop campus publications, assignments and other material, noting that they might be upsetting for people who have had traumatic experiences. Conservatives have been the loudest critics of campus political correctness, and hailed the Chicago statement as a victory. Mary Katharine Ham, a senior writer for The Federalist, a conservative website, wrote that it was “a sad commentary on higher education that this is considered a brave and bold move, but it is, and the University of Chicago should be applauded mightily for stating what used to be obvious. ” But while conservatives often frame campus free speech as a    issue, the dispute is often within the left. “Historically, the left has been much more protective of academic freedom than the right, particularly in the university context,” said Geoffrey R. Stone, a University of Chicago law professor who specializes in free speech issues. Conservatives “suddenly became the champions of free speech, which I find is a bit ironic, but the left is divided. ” Mr. Lukianoff said he and his group are often mistakenly called conservative, adding, “I'm a former A. C. L. U. person who worked in refugee camps. ” The dispute over free speech has ricocheted off campuses and around the country. In a commencement speech this year at Howard University, Obama said: “Don't try to shut folks out, don't try to shut them down, no matter how much you might disagree with them. There's been a trend around the country of trying to get colleges to disinvite speakers with a different point of view, or disrupt a politician's rally. Don't do that  —   no matter how ridiculous or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mouths. ” The University of Chicago has long been associated with the conservative school of economics that is named for it. It also takes pride in a history of free expression, like allowing the Communist Party candidate for president, William Z. Foster, to speak on the ornate   campus on the city's South Side in 1932, despite fierce criticism. Mr. Obama taught constitutional law at the university law school. The university said Friday that Dean Ellision and the university president, Robert R. Zimmer, were not available to discuss the letter or what prompted it, but Mr. Manier referred queries to Professor Stone, a former university provost. Last year, a faculty Committee on Freedom of Expression, appointed by Dr. Zimmer and headed by Professor Stone,  produced a report stating that “it is not the proper role of the university to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive. ” “We didn't feel we were doing something, internal to the University of Chicago, that was in any way radical or different,” Professor Stone said Friday. It is clear that some colleges are retreating from the same free speech values, he said, “but my guess, if you asked most of these institutions 10 or 20 years ago, they would have said more or less what we said in our statement. ” Since Professor Stone's committee produced its report, several other universities, including Princeton, Purdue, Columbia and the University of Wisconsin system, have adopted similar policies or statements, some of them taken almost verbatim from the report. And this week's letter to University of Chicago freshmen draws from that and specifically cites the report as embodying the university's point of view. Many academics say the concerns reflected in the University of Chicago letter, while real, are overblown. “I asked faculty if any had ever been asked to give trigger warnings,” said Dr. Roth, of Wesleyan. “I think one person said they had. ” There often seems to be a generational divide on campus speech  —   young people demanding greater sensitivity, and their elders telling them to get thicker skins  —   but a survey by the Knight Foundation and Gallup gives a murkier picture. It found that 78 percent of college students said they preferred a campus “where students are exposed to all types of speech and viewpoints,” including offensive and biased speech, over a campus where such speech is prohibited. Students were actually more likely to give that response than adults generally. But when asked specifically about “slurs and other language on campus that is intentionally offensive to certain groups,” 69 percent of college students said that colleges should be allowed to impose restrictions on such expression. Eric Holmberg, the student body president at the University of Chicago, said the letter suggested that administrators “don't understand what a trigger warning is,” and seemed “based on this false narrative of coddled millennials. ” “It's an effort to frame any sort of activism on campus as    just young people who are upset,” Mr. Holmberg said, “when in reality I'd say the administration is far more fearful of challenge than any student I know. ” Sara Zubi, a Chicago junior majoring in public policy, said the dean's letter seemed contrary to some of the support programs the university has created or endorsed, like a “safe space program” for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students. “To say the university doesn't support that is really hypocritical and contradictory,” she said, “and it also just doesn't make sense. ”",False,"The anodyne welcome letter to incoming freshmen is a college staple, but this week the University of Chicago took a different approach: It sent new students a blunt statement opposing some hallmarks of campus political correctness, drawing thousands of impassioned responses, for and against, as it caromed around cyberspace.

2,3754,21454,Quake Exposes Italy's Challenge to Retrofit Its Architecture - The NY Times,NY Times,Gaia Pianigiani and Elisabetta Povoledo,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"CASETTA, Italy  —   Romano Camassi, a seismologist, picked up a   speck as he surveyed the damage from this week's earthquake on the green mountain crest where the village of Casetta, now ruins, once perched. “This is just ground, soil,” he said, sadly. “In so many buildings in this area, that was the material used to keep together the irregular stones found in the surroundings which people used to build their homes. ” Experts like Mr. Camassi, who was part of the first team from Italy's Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology to arrive at the quake zone in central Italy, say the destruction was amplified by vulnerable buildings whose upgrades to   codes were deemed too costly for many Italians to carry out, too complicated to finance and too cumbersome to get approved. Italy is beloved for its rich architectural history. But that beauty comes at a steep price: both the lives lost when nature reminds its borrowers who is boss, and the money required in the attempt to even the scales. The country has spent an average of 3. 5 billion euros a year, or $3. 9 billion, for the past 50 years to fix earthquake damage, according to the Italian Association of Builders. And, in the aftermath of Wednesday's quake, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced yet another plan to rebuild and buttress Italy's ancient infrastructure. Many experts maintain that Italy has among the world's best   standards already  —   at least on paper. But the problems in executing them are legion: money, corruption, tangled bureaucracy, shoddy construction and a lack of enforcement of national regulations at the local level. This quake, like many in the past, already seems likely to expose corners that were cut, contributing to the 280 or more deaths in about 80 villages in the area along the Apennines, Italy's fragile spinal cord, where the 6.  quake struck. Prosecutors quickly announced an investigation into why a school in Amatrice, the town of about 2, 600 where the most deaths occurred, and the bell tower in nearby Accumoli collapsed. The bell tower, which had recently been refurbished, killed an entire family when it fell. The school, built in the 1930s and renovated in 2012, was supposedly built to new   standards. “You can have the best rules, but if the weak link is the human factor then it's all over,” said Gianpaolo Rosati, a professor of structural engineering at the Polytechnic University of Milan. “Unfortunately, we find ourselves always protesting about the same things. ” Perhaps the most central, and inescapable, problem is that Italy is old. About 60 percent of its buildings are estimated to be more than 100 years old. That means that most of the country's architectural heritage was built before any of the modern   standards were instituted. “You can't ask that an ancient structure adhere to norms designed for modern structures, but you can try to improve them, that's the path to take with the objective to save human lives,” said Donatella Guzzoni, an engineer and an expert in the preservation of historic buildings. “Italy has the best technologies to do this,” she added. “But it does come down to money. ” Casetta, a hamlet of about two dozen homes, sat on the hill north of Amatrice on the east side of the Tronto River that cuts this valley between two mountain chains. The area was among the most devastated by the quake for a combination of historical, economic and cultural reasons, Mr. Camassi said. “In many cases, they used rounded river stones, put next to one another by someone who ignored even the most ancient best construction practices,” he said. He pointed to a long cement beam hanging perilously from the debris of a   house. “When residents decided to reinforce the buildings, they often substituted the light wooden roofs with cement beams and bricks like that, which only worsened the impact of the quake because they burdened the otherwise frail structure,” he said. Mr. Camassi and other experts pointed out that certifying an existing building to   standards was difficult and often too expensive for most people. Just having a technical expert determine a building's vulnerability has a price, Mr. Rosati said, estimating it would cost around 10, 000 euros to evaluate a small house. “The cost of reinforcing a building to meet   standards can be around 300 euro per square meter, which means the owner of a largish apartment faces a cost of some 300, 000 euro,” he said, sometimes more than the apartment is worth. And it is not enough for just one homeowner to want to sleep a little easier. “The entire apartment building has to agree to do the same,” he added, and if the palazzos or apartment buildings are connected, the whole neighborhood must agree. Villages like Amatrice and Accumoli are loved for the charm of their narrow streets and spaces, where houses were built cheek to cheek over the centuries to use prime land, often atop narrow peaks. In those tightly packed places, the entire block must be reinforced or the buildings “interact” in an earthquake and can topple like dominoes, Mr. Rosati said. That is precisely the dynamic Mr. Camassi found in Casetta. “Neighbors built in different periods, different buildings with different materials, but adjacent,” he said. “So even those that would have resisted the quake were damaged or even taken down by the others. ” Farther up the mountain is Cossito, an idyllic village of little houses with red geraniums on the terraces. One narrow street divides a recently restored building from the town square, where almost all homes collapsed, killing at least three people. The village had only four families, Mr. Camassi said, and they all lost a member or a close friend. “We thought we did all we needed, but now we simply need to erase this house,” said Roberto Paganelli, a former police officer in the Carabinieri, who was retrieving items from his    mother's home. The building dates to 1864, he said, and was reinforced in the 1960s. The costs of evaluating and retrofitting old structures are prohibitive for many in this corner of Italy, an easy drive from Rome. Many of these homes were used only in the summer and were not primary residences worth a huge investment. In many cases, the residents are old, living on a pension and barely getting by. The state cannot oblige homeowners to upgrade their buildings unless there are obvious reasons to intervene. “We have    norms, but they only apply to new buildings or important restorations,” said Luca Ferrari, the president of Italy's Association of Seismic Engineers. “For the vast majority of buildings, we don't have an   classification, so no one knows whether they are dangerous or not during a quake. ” With a   group of experts, Mr. Ferrari drafted guidelines to classify buildings, with parameters similar to the energy efficiency of a building. This work finished in April 2015, but the government campaign  —   and its fiscal incentives  —   to reinforce existing buildings were still lacking, he said. “This area is at very high seismic danger, and we know that in these small towns of the Apennine Mountains, there are vulnerable buildings,” said Filippo Bernardini, a geologist who worked on Mr. Camassi's team. “Unless we build better, we offer no hope for the future. ” The alternative  —   razing ancient buildings to construct modern,    palazzos  —   is hardly an option. “In other countries there is greater renewal of the architectural patrimony. They don't think much about knocking something down to rebuild to different standards,” said Sergio Lagomarsino, an engineering professor at the University of Genoa. But, as Mr. Lagomarsino pointed out, Italy has a more conservative approach and is aware that preserving its heritage has value for the country. “In the face of an important building you can't demolish a historic center and rebuild it with fake stones,” he said. “It would ‘denaturalize' Italy. ”",False,"CASETTA, Italy     Romano Camassi, a seismologist, picked up a   speck as he surveyed the damage from this week's earthquake on the green mountain crest where the village of Casetta, now ruins, once perched. This is just ground, soil, he said, sadly. In so many buildings in this area, that was the material used to keep together the irregular stones found in the surroundings which people used to build their homes.  Experts like Mr. Camassi, who was part of the first team from Italy's Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology to arrive at the quake zone in central Italy, say the destruction was amplified by vulnerable buildings whose upgrades to   codes were deemed too costly for many Italians to carry out, too complicated to finance and too cumbersome to get approved. Italy is beloved for its rich architectural history. But that beauty comes at a steep price: both the lives lost when nature reminds its borrowers who is boss, and the money required in the attempt to even the scales. The country has spent an average of 3. 5 billion euros a year, or $3. 9 billion, for the past 50 years to fix earthquake damage, according to the Italian Association of Builders. And, in the aftermath of Wednesday's quake, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced yet another plan to rebuild and buttress Italy's ancient infrastructure. Many experts maintain that Italy has among the world's best   standards already     at least on paper. But the problems in executing them are legion: money, corruption, tangled bureaucracy, shoddy construction and a lack of enforcement of national regulations at the local level. This quake, like many in the past, already seems likely to expose corners that were cut, contributing to the 280 or more deaths in about 80 villages in the area along the Apennines, Italy's fragile spinal cord, where the 6.  quake struck. Prosecutors quickly announced an investigation into why a school in Amatrice, the town of about 2, 600 where the most deaths occurred, and the bell tower in nearby Accumoli collapsed. The bell tower, which had recently been refurbished, killed an entire family when it fell. The school, built in the 1930s and renovated in 2012, was supposedly built to new   standards. You can have the best rules, but if the weak link is the human factor then it's all over, said Gianpaolo Rosati, a professor of structural engineering at the Polytechnic University of Milan. Unfortunately, we find ourselves always protesting about the same things.  Perhaps the most central, and inescapable, problem is that Italy is old. About 60 percent of its buildings are estimated to be more than 100 years old. That means that most of the country's architectural heritage was built before any of the modern   standards were instituted. You can't ask that an ancient structure adhere to norms designed for modern structures, but you can try to improve them, that's the path to take with the objective to save human lives, said Donatella Guzzoni, an engineer and an expert in the preservation of historic buildings. Italy has the best technologies to do this, she added. But it does come down to money.  Casetta, a hamlet of about two dozen homes, sat on the hill north of Amatrice on the east side of the Tronto River that cuts this valley between two mountain chains. The area was among the most devastated by the quake for a combination of historical, economic and cultural reasons, Mr. Camassi said. In many cases, they used rounded river stones, put next to one another by someone who ignored even the most ancient best construction practices, he said. He pointed to a long cement beam hanging perilously from the debris of a   house. When residents decided to reinforce the buildings, they often substituted the light wooden roofs with cement beams and bricks like that, which only worsened the impact of the quake because they burdened the otherwise frail structure, he said. Mr. Camassi and other experts pointed out that certifying an existing building to   standards was difficult and often too expensive for most people. Just having a technical expert determine a building's vulnerability has a price, Mr. Rosati said, estimating it would cost around 10, 000 euros to evaluate a small house. The cost of reinforcing a building to meet   standards can be around 300 euro per square meter, which means the owner of a largish apartment faces a cost of some 300, 000 euro, he said, sometimes more than the apartment is worth. And it is not enough for just one homeowner to want to sleep a little easier. The entire apartment building has to agree to do the same, he added, and if the palazzos or apartment buildings are connected, the whole neighborhood must agree. Villages like Amatrice and Accumoli are loved for the charm of their narrow streets and spaces, where houses were built cheek to cheek over the centuries to use prime land, often atop narrow peaks. In those tightly packed places, the entire block must be reinforced or the buildings interact in an earthquake and can topple like dominoes, Mr. Rosati said. That is precisely the dynamic Mr. Camassi found in Casetta. Neighbors built in different periods, different buildings with different materials, but adjacent, he said. So even those that would have resisted the quake were damaged or even taken down by the others.  Farther up the mountain is Cossito, an idyllic village of little houses with red geraniums on the terraces. One narrow street divides a recently restored building from the town square, where almost all homes collapsed, killing at least three people. The village had only four families, Mr. Camassi said, and they all lost a member or a close friend. We thought we did all we needed, but now we simply need to erase this house, said Roberto Paganelli, a former police officer in the Carabinieri, who was retrieving items from his    mother's home. The building dates to 1864, he said, and was reinforced in the 1960s. The costs of evaluating and retrofitting old structures are prohibitive for many in this corner of Italy, an easy drive from Rome. Many of these homes were used only in the summer and were not primary residences worth a huge investment. In many cases, the residents are old, living on a pension and barely getting by.

3,3755,21455,"A Cheaper Airbag, and Takata's Road to a Deadly Crisis - The NY Times",NY Times,Hiroko Tabuchi,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"In the late 1990s, General Motors got an unexpected and enticing offer. A   Japanese supplier, Takata, had designed a much cheaper automotive airbag. G. M. turned to its airbag supplier  —   the   company Autoliv  —   and asked it to match the cheaper design or risk losing the automaker's business, according to Linda Rink, who was a senior scientist at Autoliv assigned to the G. M. account at the time. But when Autoliv's scientists studied the Takata airbag, they found that it relied on a dangerously volatile compound in its inflater, a critical part that causes the airbag to expand. “We just said, ‘No, we can't do it. We're not going to use it,'” said Robert Taylor, Autoliv's head chemist until 2010. Today, that compound is at the heart of the largest automotive safety recall in history. At least 14 people have been killed and more than 100 have been injured by faulty inflaters made by Takata. More than 100 million of its airbags have been installed in cars in the USA by General Motors and 16 other automakers. Details of G. M.'s   process almost 20 years ago, which has not been reported previously, suggest that a quest for savings of just a few dollars per airbag compromised a critical safety device, resulting in passenger deaths. The findings also indicate that automakers played a far more active role in the prelude to the crisis: Rather than being the victims of Takata's missteps, automakers pressed their suppliers to put cost before all else. “General Motors told us they were going to buy Takata's inflaters unless we could make a cheaper one,” Ms. Rink said. Her team was told that the Takata inflaters were as much as 30 percent cheaper per module, she added, a potential savings of several dollars per airbag. “That set off a big panic on how to compete. ” Tom Wilkinson, a spokesman for General Motors, which was reorganized as a new company after declaring bankruptcy in 2009, said the Takata discussions “occurred two decades ago between old G. M. and a supplier,” and therefore it was “not appropriate for us to comment. ” “We knew that G. M. was getting   inflaters from others,” said Chris Hock, a former member of Mr. Taylor's team who left Autoliv in April. “That was a dangerous path. ” Even with the record recall, deadly accidents and research critical of ammonium nitrate, Takata continues to manufacture airbags with the compound  —   and automakers continue to buy them. The airbags appear in the 2016 models of seven automakers, and they are also being installed in cars as replacement airbags for those being recalled. Takata said in a statement that it had taken steps to protect the ammonium nitrate it uses against temperature changes, which along with moisture are the main factors contributing to its volatility. The manufacturer said it was also studying, along with safety regulators and some automakers, inflaters with a drying agent “to better understand and quantify their service life. ” The new airbag came not a moment too soon for Takata. The Japanese supplier had been making seatbelts in the USA since the   but its airbag business, which it began in earnest in the 1990s, was in trouble. A previous generation of airbags supplied to Nissan had the problem of deploying too forcefully. Those airbags were linked to at least 40 eye injuries in the 1990s. Takata began experimenting with alternative propellants. But in 1997 its inflater plant in Moses Lake, Wash. was rocked by a series of explosions that destroyed equipment and greatly curtailed production, according to insurance claims made by the company at the time. After the blast, Takata was forced to buy inflaters from competitors and airlift them to automakers across the country. The company's American business struggled “to maintain corporate viability,” Takata said in a lawsuit filed against its insurer. It was against that difficult backdrop that Takata embraced the cheaper new compound, ammonium nitrate, in its airbag inflaters, according to former employees. Mark Lillie, who had worked as an engineer at Takata, told The NY Times in 2014 that considerations over cost spurred the supplier to use the compound, despite the dangers associated with it. Mr. Lillie raised concerns over the risks in the late 1990s, but his warnings went unheeded. Around the same time, the team at Autoliv was asked to study the Takata design. Mr. Taylor, the head Autoliv chemist, said his team immediately recognized the risks posed by the ammonium nitrate. “We tore the Takata airbags apart, analyzed all the fuel, identified all the ingredients,” he said. The takeaway, he said, was that when the airbag was detonated, “the gas is generated so fast, it blows the inflater to bits. ” Mr. Hock, the former member of Mr. Taylor's team, said he recalled carrying out testing on a mock ammonium nitrate inflater that produced explosive results that left his team shaken. “When we lit it off, it totally destroyed the fixture,” he said. “It turned it into shrapnel. ” The former Autoliv scientists said that they considered their verdict against the ammonium nitrate irrefutable, so much so that they understood Autoliv had alerted other automakers to the danger. An Autoliv spokesman declined to comment on the company's dealings with its automotive customers, which at the time also included Chrysler, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi and Toyota. Though Autoliv continued to supply those companies, several started using Takata's new airbags in the early to  . Fiat Chrysler declined to comment, while Honda, Mitsubishi and Toyota said that they had not located any pertinent information from that period. “There was no industry understanding in the late 1990s” that ammonium nitrate propellants, or explosives, were risky, Matt Sloustcher, a Honda spokesman, said in an emailed statement. Autoliv's concerns were backed by   research. Widely available studies going back decades warned of the tricky properties of ammonium nitrate, which can break down when exposed to moisture or temperature changes  —   vital factors, federal regulators said, with the defective Takata airbags. “Some of the worst industrial accidents at the worldwide level involve ammonium nitrate,” Luigi T. De Luca, an Italian academic and a leading expert in solid propellant rockets, said in an email. In a 2003 presentation, a propellant expert at TRW, which also made airbags with ammonium nitrate for several years in the early 2000s, outlined what he called “  issues” with using the compound, warning of “conditions that stimulate an explosive response. ” The expert, Harold R. Blomquist, said that explosive response could be triggered by moisture and by temperature swings. To make the inflaters safe, TRW had adopted several practices, according to Mr. Blomquist's presentation and a spokesman at TRW. It   its ammonium nitrate to protect it from moisture during the manufacturing process. It fitted its inflaters with a pressure release valve to prevent ammonium nitrate from overpressurizing. And it used advanced welding to keep the inflaters airtight. Those safeguards, however, were not   and the company phased out its use of ammonium nitrate in 2006. (Both Autoliv and TRW now use a propellant based on guanidine nitrate, a compound that is less sensitive to moisture and temperature swings.) The dangers associated with ammonium nitrate made it difficult at times for Takata to find a supplier. An internal memo prepared in March 2000 by the Mississippi Chemical Corporation, an agricultural fertilizer supplier, states that early talks to supply Takata with ammonium nitrate fell apart over liability issues. A handwritten note on the memo notes: “Send letter informing them about explosion hazard. ” Airbag design and performance specifications are set by a consortium of automakers, with little involvement by safety regulators. In congressional testimony, Takata has insisted that specifications set by the automakers did not anticipate the problems caused by exposure to heat and humidity over many years. But a review of the consortium's design and performance specifications by The Times shows the automotive industry had raised concerns about the risks of ammonium nitrate more than a decade ago. A 2004 update to its specifications singled out ammonium nitrate inflaters and required them to “undergo added stability evaluation. ” The specifications from the consortium, known as the USA Council on Automotive Research, show a clear understanding of the damaging effects of moisture and temperature on airbag explosives. Inflaters must be evaluated for their “resistance to temperature aging in an environment of high humidity,” the specifications said. The problem, it appears, is that no one enforced the specifications. The update in the specifications was issued four years before Honda, the automaker most affected by the defective airbags, started issuing recalls in 2008. It was not until 2013 that other automakers started recalling cars with the airbags. Today, 64 million of the defective airbags have been subject to the recall. The lack of enforcement of the specifications points to the   nature of automotive manufacturing. Joan Claybrook, a former administrator at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said that while the safety agency should have been more engaged, the system places a heavy onus on automakers to make sure that suppliers comply with basic safety standards. “Automakers play a big role,” she said. “They're expected to be involved with their suppliers in a very detailed way. ” A former Takata engineer who spoke to The Times and who was recently deposed by Honda in litigation with Takata revealed how easily the supplier avoided detection in getting the defective airbags to market. Workers at a   Takata plant in La Grange, Ga. manipulated tests meant to measure whether inflaters were airtight, said the former engineer, who still works in the automotive industry and spoke on the condition of anonymity. His testimony in the lawsuit has not yet been made public. The tests involved inserting a small amount of helium gas into the inflaters. The inflaters were then put in a vacuum. If too much helium was detected outside the inflater, that meant the inflater had a leak, was defective and should be scrapped. But workers at the La Grange factory would take the defective inflaters and test them repeatedly, to deplete the helium. With no helium left inside, the inflaters would pass the test, according to the engineer. The workers would then give the defective inflaters new bar code identifiers, so the repeated testing could not be tracked. The engineer said he questioned his Takata bosses in 2001 about manipulating the tests, but was told “not to come back to any more meetings. ” He left the company later that year. Honda said that it became aware of the manipulated tests only when the engineer was deposed by its lawyers. “Honda expects its suppliers to act with integrity at all times and is deeply troubled by this behavior by one of our suppliers,” the automaker said in a statement. Susan Bairley, a spokeswoman for the consortium led by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, said it did not keep records “of discussions leading to research results,” so it could not comment on concerns that might have resulted from the 2004 update to its airbag specifications.

4,3772,21474,Gene Wilder Dies at 83 Star of ‘Willy Wonka' and ‘Young Frankenstein' - The NY Times,NY Times,Daniel Lewis,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Gene Wilder, who established himself as one of America's foremost comic actors with his delightfully neurotic performances in three films directed by Mel Brooks his eccentric star turn in the family classic “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” and his winning chemistry with Richard Pryor in the   smash “Stir Crazy,” died early Monday morning at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 83. A nephew, the filmmaker Jordan   confirmed his death in a statement, saying the cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease. Mr. Wilder's rule for comedy was simple: Don't try to make it funny try to make it real. “I'm an actor, not a clown,” he said more than once. With his haunted blue eyes and an empathy born of his own history of psychic distress, he aspired to touch audiences much as Charlie Chaplin had. The Chaplin film “City Lights,” he said, had “made the biggest impression on me as an actor it was funny, then sad, then both at the same time. ” Mr. Wilder was an accomplished stage actor as well as a screenwriter, a novelist and the director of four movies in which he starred. (He directed, he once said, “in order to protect what I wrote, which I wrote in order to act. ”) But he was best known for playing roles on the big screen that might have been ripped from the pages of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. He made his movie debut in 1967 in Arthur Penn's celebrated crime drama, “Bonnie and Clyde,” in which he was memorably hysterical as an undertaker kidnapped by the notorious   bank robbers played by Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty. He was even more hysterical, and even more memorable, a year later in “The Producers,” the first film by Mr. Brooks, who later turned it into a Broadway hit. Mr. Wilder played the    accountant Leo Bloom, who discovers how to make more money on a bad Broadway show than on a good one: Find rich backers, stage a production that's guaranteed to fold fast, then flee the country with the leftover cash. Unhappily for Bloom and his fellow schemer, Max Bialystock, played by Zero Mostel, their outrageously tasteless musical, “Springtime for Hitler,” is a sensation. The part earned Mr. Wilder an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor. Within a few years, the anxious,   popeyed Mr. Wilder had become an unlikely movie star. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance as the wizardly title character in “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” (1971). The film was a   disappointment, partly because of parental concern that the moral of Roald Dahl's story  —   that greedy, gluttonous children should not go unpunished  —   was too dark in the telling. But it went on to gain a devoted following, and Willy Wonka remains one of the roles with which Mr. Wilder is most closely identified. His next role was more adult but equally strange: an otherwise normal doctor who falls in love with a sheep named Daisy in a segment of Woody Allen's “Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but Were Afraid to Ask,” in 1972. Two years later, he reunited with Mr. Brooks for perhaps the two   entries in either man's filmography. In “Blazing Saddles,” a raunchy,    spoof of Hollywood westerns, Mr. Wilder had the relatively quiet role of the Waco Kid, a boozy   who helps an improbable black sheriff (Cleavon Little) save a town from railroad barons and venal politicians. The film's   humor may have lost some of its edge over the years, but Mr. Wilder's next Brooks film, “Young Frankenstein,” has never grown old. Mr. Wilder himself hatched the idea, envisioning a    film faithful to the look of the Boris Karloff “Frankenstein,” down to the laboratory equipment, but played for laughs rather than for horror. He would portray an American man of science, the grandson of the infamous Dr. Frankenstein, who tries to turn his back on his heritage (“that's   ”) but finds himself irresistibly drawn to Transylvania to duplicate his grandfather's creation of a monster in a spooky mountaintop laboratory. Mr. Brooks's original reaction to the idea, Mr. Wilder recalled, was noncommittal: “Cute. That's cute. ” But he eventually came aboard as director and   and the two garnered an Oscar nomination for their screenplay. Serendipity played a role in the casting. Mr. Wilder's agent asked him to help find work for two new clients, and thus Marty Feldman became Frankenstein's assistant, Igor (“that's  ”) and Peter Boyle the monster. Madeline Kahn, whose performance as the chanteuse Lili Von Shtupp had been a highlight of “Blazing Saddles,” played the doctor's socialite fiancée. Cloris Leachman was Frau Blücher, the sound of whose name caused horses to whinny in fear. The name Blücher, Mr. Wilder said in a 2008 interview with The San Jose Mercury News, came from a book of letters to and from Sigmund Freud: “I saw someone named Blücher had written to him, and I said, ‘Well, that's the name. '” And Mr. Wilder certainly knew a lot about Freud. His first of many visits to a psychotherapist is the opening scene in the memoir he published in 2005, “Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art. ” “What seems to be the trouble?” the therapist asks. “I want to give all my money away,” he says. “How much do you have?” “I owe three hundred dollars. ” Soon the jokes and evasions give way to the torments of sexual repression, guilt feelings and his “demon,” a compulsion, lasting several years, to pray out loud to God at the most embarrassing times and in the most embarrassing places. But never onstage or onscreen, where he felt free to be someone else. Gene Wilder was born Jerome Silberman in Milwaukee on June 11, 1933. His father, William, a manufacturer and salesman of novelty items, was an immigrant from Russia. His mother, the former Jeanne Baer, suffered from rheumatic heart disease and a temperament that sometimes led her to punish young Jerry angrily and then smother him with regretful kisses. He spent one semester at the   Military Institute in Hollywood. His mother saw it as a great opportunity in reality, it was a catch basin for boys from broken families, where he was regularly beaten up for being Jewish. Safely back home after that misadventure, he played minor roles in community theater productions and then followed his older sister, Corinne, into the theater program at the University of Iowa. After Iowa, he studied Shakespeare at the Bristol Old Vic Theater School in England, where he was the first freshman to win the school fencing championship. He next enrolled part time at the HB Studio in NY, while also serving a   Army hitch as an aide in the psychiatric unit of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Pennsylvania  —   an assignment he requested because, he said, “I imagined the things I would see there might relate more to acting than any of the other choices. ” He added, “I wasn't wrong. ” After his discharge, he won a coveted spot at the Actors Studio, and it was then that he adopted the name Gene Wilder: Gene for Eugene Gant, the protagonist of Thomas Wolfe's “Look Homeward, Angel,” and Wilder for the playwright Thornton Wilder. In his first major role on Broadway, Mr. Wilder played the chaplain in a 1963 production of Bertolt Brecht's “Mother Courage and Her Children. ” The production ran for less than two months, and he came to believe that he had been miscast. The good news was that he met the boyfriend of the star, Anne Bancroft: Mel Brooks, who wore a pea coat the night he met Mr. Wilder backstage and told him, “You know, they used to call these urine jackets, but they didn't sell. ” So began the conversation that ultimately led to “The Producers. ” Mr. Wilder's association with Mr. Brooks led, in turn, to one with Richard Pryor, who was one of the writers of “Blazing Saddles” (and Mr. Brooks's original choice for the part ultimately played by Mr. Little). In 1976, Mr. Pryor was   behind Mr. Wilder and Jill Clayburgh in “Silver Streak,” a comic thriller about murder on a transcontinental train. The two men went on to star in the 1980 hit “Stir Crazy,” in which they played a hapless pair jailed for a crime they didn't commit, as well as “See No Evil, Hear No Evil” (1989) and “Another You” (1991). Mr. Wilder's first two marriages, to Mary Mercier and Mary Joan Schutz, ended in divorce. In 1982, he met the “Saturday Night Live” comedian Gilda Radner when they were both cast in the suspense comedy “Hanky Panky. ” One evening, he recalled in “Kiss Me Like a Stranger,” he and Ms. Radner innocently ended up at his hotel to review some script changes. The time came for her to go instead, she shoved him down on the bed, jumped on top of him and announced, “I have a plan for fun!” He sent her home anyway  —   she was married to another man  —   but before long, they began a relationship. By his account, Ms. Radner was needy, obsessed with getting married and, once they married in 1984, obsessed with having a child, a project that ended in miscarriage just months before she learned she had ovarian cancer in 1986. Of their first year of living together, he wrote: “We didn't get along well, and that's a fact. We just loved each other, and that's a fact. ” He left, only to find that he needed to go back. Ms. Radner died in 1989. “I had one great blessing: I was so dumb,” Mr. Wilder once said of her last years. “I believed even three weeks before she died she would make it. ” In memory of Ms. Radner, he helped to found an ovarian cancer detection center in her name, in Los Angeles, and Gilda's Club, a network of support centers for people with cancer. He also contributed to a book, “Gilda's Disease” (1998) with Dr. M. Steven Piver. Mr. Wilder himself developed  's lymphoma in 1999. With chemotherapy and a   transplant, he was in remission by 2005. In 1991 Mr. Wilder married Karen Boyer, a hearing specialist who had coached him in the filming of “See No Evil, Hear No Evil,” in which his character was deaf and Mr. Pryor's was blind. She survives him, as does a daughter from an earlier marriage. His sister died in January. Even before he became ill, Mr. Wilder had begun slowing down. He made his first and last attempt at a television series, the   and   comedy “Something Wilder,” in 1994. He returned to the theater in 1997 in a London production of Neil Simon's “Laughter on the 23rd Floor. ” In 1999 he was a writer for two TV movies in which he starred, “Murder in a Small Town” and “The Lady in Question,” playing a theater director turned amateur sleuth. In 2001 he appeared at the Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut in a program of   farces. Shortly after appearing in an episode of “Will  Grace” in 2003  —   he won an Emmy for that role  —   he declared that he had retired from acting for good. “I don't like show business, I realized,” he said in 2008. “I like show, but I don't like the business. ” He was by then enjoying a new career as a novelist. His “My French Whore,” published in 2007, was the story of a naïve young American who impersonates a German spy in World War I. (“Just fluff, but sweet fluff,” the novelist Carolyn See wrote in her review in The Washington Post.) It was followed by two more novels, “The Woman Who Wouldn't” and “Something to Remember You By,” and a story collection, “What Is This Thing Called Love?” But it was, of course, as an actor that Mr. Wilder left his most lasting mark. In his memoir, he posed a question about his life's work, then answered it: “What do actors really want? To be great actors? Yes, but you can't buy talent, so it's best to leave the word ‘great' out of it. I think to be believed, onstage or onscreen, is the one hope that all actors share. ”",False,"Gene Wilder, who established himself as one of America's foremost comic actors with his delightfully neurotic performances in three films directed by Mel Brooks his eccentric star turn in the family classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and his winning chemistry with Richard Pryor in the   smash Stir Crazy, died early Monday morning at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 83. A nephew, the filmmaker Jordan   confirmed his death in a statement, saying the cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease. Mr. Wilder's rule for comedy was simple: Don't try to make it funny try to make it real. I'm an actor, not a clown, he said more than once. With his haunted blue eyes and an empathy born of his own history of psychic distress, he aspired to touch audiences much as Charlie Chaplin had. The Chaplin film City Lights, he said, had made the biggest impression on me as an actor it was funny, then sad, then both at the same time.  Mr. Wilder was an accomplished stage actor as well as a screenwriter, a novelist and the director of four movies in which he starred. (He directed, he once said, in order to protect what I wrote, which I wrote in order to act. ) But he was best known for playing roles on the big screen that might have been ripped from the pages of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. He made his movie debut in 1967 in Arthur Penn's celebrated crime drama, Bonnie and Clyde, in which he was memorably hysterical as an undertaker kidnapped by the notorious   bank robbers played by Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty. He was even more hysterical, and even more memorable, a year later in The Producers, the first film by Mr. Brooks, who later turned it into a Broadway hit. Mr. Wilder played the    accountant Leo Bloom, who discovers how to make more money on a bad Broadway show than on a good one: Find rich backers, stage a production that's guaranteed to fold fast, then flee the country with the leftover cash. Unhappily for Bloom and his fellow schemer, Max Bialystock, played by Zero Mostel, their outrageously tasteless musical, Springtime for Hitler, is a sensation. The part earned Mr. Wilder an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor. Within a few years, the anxious,   popeyed Mr. Wilder had become an unlikely movie star. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance as the wizardly title character in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971). The film was a   disappointment, partly because of parental concern that the moral of Roald Dahl's story     that greedy, gluttonous children should not go unpunished     was too dark in the telling. But it went on to gain a devoted following, and Willy Wonka remains one of the roles with which Mr. Wilder is most closely identified. His next role was more adult but equally strange: an otherwise normal doctor who falls in love with a sheep named Daisy in a segment of Woody Allen's Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but Were Afraid to Ask, in 1972. Two years later, he reunited with Mr. Brooks for perhaps the two   entries in either man's filmography.

5,3783,21485,Marco Rubio and John McCain Win Primaries in Florida and Arizona - The NY Times,NY Times,Lizette Alvarez,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"MIAMI  —   Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and John McCain of Arizona brushed off primary challenges on Tuesday from Republican contenders. Mr. Rubio will face a   race against Representative Patrick Murphy, a   Democrat, in a crucial contest for control of the Senate. Mr. McCain, seeking a sixth term, could also face a serious challenge, from Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, who has made it a point of her campaign to court Latinos and American Indians in an increasingly diverse and competitive state. The contest between Mr. Rubio and Mr. Murphy is likely to be among the most expensive Senate contests in the country. With his onetime rival Donald J. Trump at the top of the Republican presidential ticket, Mr. Rubio, 45, will seek to fend off Mr. Murphy, 33, who has faced recent accusations of résumé padding. They were not the only recognizable names to win races on Tuesday and move on to the Nov. 8 general election. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the embattled former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, won her South Florida battle against a   law professor who was endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The primary results appeared to point to a preference among voters in Florida, a pivotal swing state, to eschew more extreme candidates on the right and the left in favor of establishment lawmakers favored by national party leaders. Mr. McCain, 80, of Arizona faced a challenge from his right from Kelli Ward, a family doctor and a former state senator. In Florida, Mr. Rubio, who was asked by Republican leaders to enter the Senate race after saying he would not seek   defeated Carlos Beruff, a wealthy   gulf coast homebuilder. Mr. Beruff, who spent $8 million of his money on his bid, is an avid supporter of Mr. Trump. Mr. Rubio's Democratic opponent, Mr. Murphy, bested Representative Alan Grayson, a liberal provocateur who was favored by many progressives but faced ethics inquiries in the House and accusations that he had abused his former wife. “I commit to you that I will serve my full term,” Mr. Murphy told supporters Tuesday night, suggesting that Mr. Rubio would run for president again instead. Earlier Tuesday, in an interview on CNN, Mr. Rubio had been reluctant to commit to a full term, saying, “No one can make that commitment because you don't know what the future's going to hold in your life personally or politically. ” In a victory speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Rubio pointed out that Mr. Murphy, whose father is a millionaire, grew up wealthy, a sharp contrast to Mr. Rubio's humble upbringing. Mr. Rubio added that he had no intention to deliver a “rubber stamp,” no matter who was elected president in November. Florida voters were asked to cast ballots for an unusually high number of contested congressional primaries, the result of a   redistricting map that changed 24 of the state's 27 districts. One tough fight on Tuesday was the Democratic primary in Miami's 26th Congressional District, where former Representative Joe Garcia defeated Annette Taddeo, who was selected by former Gov Charlie Crist to be his running mate in his failed 2014 bid to recapture the governor's office. Mr. Garcia had faced criticism over fraudulent absentee ballots in 2012, but was never charged with wrongdoing. One of his former staff members pleaded guilty and served jail time. Mr. Garcia will face a   incumbent, Representative Carlos Curbelo, whose seat is threatened by the new redistricting map, which made the district less hospitable to Republicans. Mr. Curbelo won the seat from Mr. Garcia in 2014. Farther north in Florida, Representative Corrine Brown, a House stalwart who more than 20 years ago became one of the first   elected to Congress from Florida, lost her seat to Al Lawson, a former state senator.

6,3787,21489,Fact-Checking Apple's Claims on EU Tax Ruling - The NY Times,NY Times,Katie Benner,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, issued a defiant letter to his European customers on Tuesday after the region's antitrust enforcer ordered Ireland to collect 13 billion euros, or about $14. 5 billion, in back taxes from the company. By turns outraged and scolding, Mr. Cook pushed back on the findings by Europe's competition commission, which said that Apple had made inappropriate   deals with the Irish government that let the technology company pay almost nothing on its European business in some years. Instead, Mr. Cook framed Apple's operations in Ireland as an investment in the people there, declared that Apple has a history as a good corporate tax citizen, and added that the European Commission's decision will hurt investment and business growth in Europe. We examined some of the points Mr. Cook made in the letter, consulting with five tax experts to   the chief executive's statements. While Mr. Cook was technically truthful, he omitted some context and shifted the spotlight from the thrust of the European Commission's case: whether Apple took advantage of loopholes in Irish tax laws. MR. COOK'S LETTER “As our business has grown over the years, we have become the largest taxpayer in Ireland, the largest taxpayer in the USA, and the largest taxpayer in the world. ” FACT CHECK While it's not a bad guess that Apple is the largest taxpayer on the planet because of the company's immense size, even Mr. Cook said in testimony before Congress in 2013 that this was just an estimate. USA corporate tax information is private, so there is no way for Apple to say for sure that it is the biggest taxpayer in the country, much less the world. The issue of how much money Apple pays in taxes is also a bit of a red herring. “This fight with the EU is not about what the company has paid in taxes overall, but about how much it should pay,” said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the   Tax Policy Center. “Tax systems are not a     system. ” _________  MR. COOK'S LETTER “In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe. ” FACT CHECK Apple, along with many multinational companies, takes advantage of differences in national tax laws by moving money around the globe in ways that shrink their overall tax burdens. While a company like Apple may pay all of the taxes that it owes, it also tries to find legal ways to owe as little as possible. The EU wants to crack down on the ways that companies minimize their tax bills in Europe, especially in Ireland. In the 1980s, Ireland began modeling itself after Bermuda, a   corporate tax haven, said Khadija Sharife, a forensic financial researcher and an editor at the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting. Ireland's corporate tax rate is 12. 5 percent, compared with 35 percent in the USA. While Ireland is phasing out some   rules, “companies will continue to come up with ways to pay less taxes in other countries until all countries across the world can agree on corporate tax rules,” said Lisa De Simone, assistant professor of accounting at Stanford University. __________ MR. COOK'S LETTER “The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes. This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals. ” FACT CHECK The European Commission makes clear, and tax experts agree, that Ireland let Apple determine how much of the income that it generated in the country would be recognized and taxed there. The rest of Apple's income that was not recognized and taxed in Ireland could be put in other corporate structures that were effectively stateless. That meant the money in those structures was not taxable anywhere  —   not even in Ireland  —   and thus not subject to Ireland's 12. 5 percent tax rate. While other companies have also had the right to negotiate with Ireland, the commission considers these sorts of loopholes a  . “In the U. S. states can fall all over themselves to offer subsidies and loopholes, but that is exactly what is illegal in Europe,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. __________ MR. COOK'S LETTER “The Commission's move is unprecedented and it has serious,   implications. It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been. ” FACT CHECK Mr. Kleinbard said the commission is not replacing Ireland's tax law with a view of what the commission thinks should happen. It is simply asking Ireland to enforce the tax rate that it has and close loopholes that allow companies like Apple not to recognize large portions of the income they generate in Ireland and pay even less. __________ MR. COOK'S LETTER “This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EUmember states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe. ” FACT CHECK Stanford's Ms. De Simone agrees with Apple that the EUruling hurts the sovereignty of its member countries. If Ireland wants to create rules that allow for stateless entities not to pay taxes anywhere, up until now that has been Ireland's decision to make. While the EUhas been trying to create harmony across the region when it comes to how to treat corporate taxes, for now taxes are “an issue for each individual member state in Europe,” said Dr. Liza Lovdahl Gormsen with the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. She said this case creates uncertainty for many multinational companies across Europe. __________ MR. COOK'S LETTER “In Apple's case, nearly all of our research and development takes place in California, so the vast majority of our profits are taxed in the USA. ” FACT CHECK It's true the majority of Apple's profits are taxed in the USA. But Ms. De Simone said Apple has also kept more than $200 billion in accumulated profits offshore. That money could someday be brought home and taxed, but Apple is in control of whether or not that actually happens. __________ MR. COOK'S LETTER “Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe. ” FACT CHECK There is support among tax experts for this statement. Mr. Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center said so many countries are motivated to use low tax rates to generate business that Europe could lose multinational business if companies are discouraged by the commission's ruling on Irish tax treatment of Apple. But Mr. Rosenthal said the issue is ultimately broader than Europe. People would do well to also remember the total amount of government revenue being lost to   tax deals, he said. “If we allow companies like Apple to pick its tax haven  —   to place a few thousand employees in a place for a lower tax rate  —   we do add a few jobs,” he said. “But more widely, the taxes given up globally could be used for public service, worker training and infrastructure repair. ”",False,"SAN FRANCISCO     Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, issued a defiant letter to his European customers on Tuesday after the region's antitrust enforcer ordered Ireland to collect 13 billion euros, or about $14. 5 billion, in back taxes from the company. By turns outraged and scolding, Mr. Cook pushed back on the findings by Europe's competition commission, which said that Apple had made inappropriate   deals with the Irish government that let the technology company pay almost nothing on its European business in some years. Instead, Mr. Cook framed Apple's operations in Ireland as an investment in the people there, declared that Apple has a history as a good corporate tax citizen, and added that the European Commission's decision will hurt investment and business growth in Europe. We examined some of the points Mr. Cook made in the letter, consulting with five tax experts to   the chief executive's statements. While Mr. Cook was technically truthful, he omitted some context and shifted the spotlight from the thrust of the European Commission's case: whether Apple took advantage of loopholes in Irish tax laws. MR. COOK'S LETTER As our business has grown over the years, we have become the largest taxpayer in Ireland, the largest taxpayer in the USA, and the largest taxpayer in the world.  FACT CHECK While it's not a bad guess that Apple is the largest taxpayer on the planet because of the company's immense size, even Mr. Cook said in testimony before Congress in 2013 that this was just an estimate. USA corporate tax information is private, so there is no way for Apple to say for sure that it is the biggest taxpayer in the country, much less the world. The issue of how much money Apple pays in taxes is also a bit of a red herring. This fight with the EU is not about what the company has paid in taxes overall, but about how much it should pay, said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the   Tax Policy Center. Tax systems are not a     system.  _________  MR. COOK'S LETTER In Ireland and in every country where we operate, Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe.  FACT CHECK Apple, along with many multinational companies, takes advantage of differences in national tax laws by moving money around the globe in ways that shrink their overall tax burdens. While a company like Apple may pay all of the taxes that it owes, it also tries to find legal ways to owe as little as possible. The EU wants to crack down on the ways that companies minimize their tax bills in Europe, especially in Ireland. In the 1980s, Ireland began modeling itself after Bermuda, a   corporate tax haven, said Khadija Sharife, a forensic financial researcher and an editor at the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting. Ireland's corporate tax rate is 12. 5 percent, compared with 35 percent in the USA. While Ireland is phasing out some   rules, companies will continue to come up with ways to pay less taxes in other countries until all countries across the world can agree on corporate tax rules, said Lisa De Simone, assistant professor of accounting at Stanford University. __________ MR. COOK'S LETTER The opinion issued on August 30th alleges that Ireland gave Apple a special deal on our taxes. This claim has no basis in fact or in law. We never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals.  FACT CHECK The European Commission makes clear, and tax experts agree, that Ireland let Apple determine how much of the income that it generated in the country would be recognized and taxed there. The rest of Apple's income that was not recognized and taxed in Ireland could be put in other corporate structures that were effectively stateless. That meant the money in those structures was not taxable anywhere     not even in Ireland     and thus not subject to Ireland's 12. 5 percent tax rate. While other companies have also had the right to negotiate with Ireland, the commission considers these sorts of loopholes a  . In the U. S. states can fall all over themselves to offer subsidies and loopholes, but that is exactly what is illegal in Europe, said Edward D. Kleinbard, professor at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. __________ MR. COOK'S LETTER The Commission's move is unprecedented and it has serious,   implications. It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been.  FACT CHECK Mr. Kleinbard said the commission is not replacing Ireland's tax law with a view of what the commission thinks should happen. It is simply asking Ireland to enforce the tax rate that it has and close loopholes that allow companies like Apple not to recognize large portions of the income they generate in Ireland and pay even less. __________ MR. COOK'S LETTER This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EUmember states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe.  FACT CHECK Stanford's Ms. De Simone agrees with Apple that the EUruling hurts the sovereignty of its member countries.

7,3797,21499,Trump Gambles on Immigration but Sends Conflicting Signals - The NY Times,NY Times,Patrick Healy,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Donald J. Trump made an audacious attempt on Wednesday to remake his image on the divisive issue of immigration, shelving his plan to deport 11 million undocumented people and arguing that a Trump administration and Mexico would secure the border together. In a spirited bid for undecided American voters to see him anew, Mr. Trump swept into Mexico City to make overtures to a nation he has repeatedly denigrated, then flew to Phoenix to outline in his usual bullying tone his latest priorities on immigration. Yet the juxtaposition of Mr. Trump's dual performances was so jarring that his true vision and intentions on immigration were hard to discern. He displayed an almost unrecognizable demeanor during his afternoon in Mexico, appearing measured and diplomatic, while hours later he took the stage at his campaign rally and denounced illegal immigrants on the whole as a criminally minded and dangerous group that sows terror in communities and commits murders, rapes and other heinous violence. Mr. Trump's mixed messages on whom he would deport and when, and how the government would go about removing people from the country, were further muddled by the incendiary language in the Phoenix speech  —   a deliberate effort by campaign advisers to draw attention to his criticism of illegal immigrants rather than the specifics of his plan. In his speech, Mr. Trump fervently tried to depict himself as an ally of average workers, saying their economic interests were far more important than the needs of undocumented workers. But he left unclear what would happen to those millions of illegal immigrants, saying only that “the appropriate disposition of those individuals” will take place at some future date after the criminals are deported and his border wall is built. Deporting all illegal immigrants had been his signature political issue for much of the presidential race, but his caustic tone and harsh approach has turned off many Republicans and independents, particularly women. His language was still fiery in Phoenix, yet he also said that the fate of most illegal immigrants would be handled humanely, and not right away. “That discussion can only take place in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time,” Mr. Trump said, using the sort of vague phrasing that he once criticized. Never had Mr. Trump gambled quite like this. Aiming to appear statesmanlike, he traveled to politically hostile territory to meet with a president who might have surprised him with a rebuke, and he also risked support from some conservatives who do not want him cozying up to Mexico or softening his immigration plans. The trip to Mexico City was not without snags. Standing beside President Peña Nieto, Mr. Trump indicated that he had pulled a punch and chosen not to discuss his campaign promise to compel Mexico to pay for the wall. Yet Mr. Peña Nieto saw it somewhat differently, saying later on Twitter that at the start of their meeting, “I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall. ” Mr. Peña Nieto did not dispute Mr. Trump at their news conference, however, and Mexican officials said that the two men did not dwell on the wall and that their meeting was conciliatory. Still, campaign advisers to Clinton, the Democratic nominee, accused Mr. Trump of lying, and the Trump campaign issued a statement saying that the meeting was “not a negotiation” and that “it is unsurprising that they hold two different views on this issue. ” In Phoenix, Mr. Trump responded to Mr. Peña Nieto with the hectoring language that has long been part of his strategy to whip up his crowds. “Mexico will pay for the wall, believe me  —   100 percent  —   they don't know it yet, but they will pay for the wall,” Mr. Trump said. “They're great people, and great leaders, but they will pay for the wall. ” Mr. Trump had billed the Phoenix speech as a major address on immigration, and many Republican leaders and voters had hoped for more clarity about his positions. Mr. Trump outlined several steps that he would take to deport criminals and those who overstayed their visas and end   sanctuary cities, while saying that “the one route and only route” for others to obtain legal status would be “to return home and apply for  . ” “We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity  —   so important,” Mr. Trump said, noting that the status of most illegal immigrants was no longer a “core issue” for him. Mr. Trump also invited a group of Americans to the stage who, one by one, shared the names of relatives who they said were killed by illegal immigrants and insisted that only Mr. Trump could protect the country by securing its borders and moving swiftly to deport immigrants with criminal records. Yet for all the fiery language and stagecraft, it was far from clear if Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters would stick by him as he moves away from his original   policy on immigration, or if he would win over many undecided voters with his new approach. But Mr. Trump went to great lengths to urge voters to view the presidential race as an epochal moment. “We are in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis, and a terrorism crisis,” he said. “This election is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better. This is it. We won't get another opportunity  —   it will be too late. ” The whirlwind day started after Mr. Trump accepted an invitation from Mr. Peña Nieto to meet him at the presidential palace to discuss economic and border concerns. For the most part they managed to sidestep combustible issues and ignore raging hostility from average Mexicans. Mr. Trump has called them rapists and drug dealers, and he did not apologize for those remarks during a joint news conference when a reporter pressed him for any regrets. Instead, as an impassive Mr. Peña Nieto looked on, Mr. Trump sounded conciliatory themes about working together to improve border security. Gone, at least for this foreign trip, were the threats about American interests and superiority that have defined Mr. Trump's candidacy and electrified his supporters. “I think it was an excellent meeting,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Peña Nieto, who pointedly emphasized goals like “mutual respect” and “constructive” relations several times in his remarks, did Mr. Trump some favors with his respectful treatment: The Mexican president acknowledged that every country had a “right” to protect its own border, and suggested that Mr. Trump wanted to move on from his antagonistic remarks of the past. “The Mexican people felt aggrieved by those comments,” Mr. Peña Nieto said. “But I am certain that he has a genuine interest in building a relationship that would lead us to provide better conditions to our people. ” Mr. Trump's unexpected trip to Mexico was timed to steer attention from his significant shifts on immigration policy. He flew to Mexico just hours before he was scheduled to deliver a major speech on immigration after more than a week of mixed signals about his immigration views, which he said were “softening” and then “hardening” in the space of two days last week. On a more personal level, Mr. Trump also wanted to show undecided voters that he had the temperament and   of a statesman  —   qualities that many doubt he has  —   and also demonstrate that Americans did not need to worry every time he opened his mouth in a foreign country. He also hoped to show that he could acquit himself well on the world stage, something that is a clear strength of Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, senator and first lady. Mrs. Clinton's campaign has described Mr. Trump's trip as a hollow gesture, but it was unclear whether Mrs. Clinton herself will deliver a more pointed critique of her opponent during his travels. Mr. Trump, who has little experience with foreign policy statecraft or news conferences with heads of state, made no obvious mistakes during his trip to Mexico, nor did he breach any protocol during his public appearance with Mr. Peña Nieto on a small stage at the presidential palace. As Mr. Peña Nieto made lengthy opening remarks in Spanish, Mr. Trump clasped his hands at times, and tapped them against his thighs as he nodded slightly at other points as he listened to a woman beside him translate the remarks into English. Mr. Peña Nieto came across as civil and stolid, defending the North American Free Trade Agreement  —   a frequent target of criticism by Mr. Trump  —   and noting that weak border security also allowed weapons and cash often to flow from the USA to Mexican gangs and drug cartels. But for the most part the president took a position of neutrality, neither chastising Mr. Trump nor indicating that he favored one American presidential candidate over another. Yet Mr. Trump, who is known for insisting that only he can fix America's problems, also suggested that he wanted Mexico to be a partner on border security. “I really believe that the president and I will solve those problems,” Mr. Trump said. “We will get them solved. Illegal immigration is a problem for Mexico as well as for us. Drugs are a tremendous problem from Mexico as well as us. I mean it's not a   street. ”",False,"Donald J.

Only the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing American society today is that there are 11 illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. ” • Trump ticked through the names of three Americans who were killed by undocumented immigrants. These are staples of his speeches and familiar to his audiences at this stage of the campaign.

Can't do it. This declaration alone will stop the crisis of illegal crossing. You can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. Those days are over. ” • Mr. Trump invited onto the stage the mothers and fathers of Americans whose children were killed by undocumented immigrants. He asked each to describe their children and how they died. He then kissed many of them on the cheek. It was the most emotional moment of the speech. “If you don't vote Trump, we won't have a country,” one of the mother told the audience. Mr. Trump, first reading slowly from a statement and then speaking more freely in response to a question, said he now considered Mr. Peña Nieto a friend and heaped praise on Americans of Mexican descent.   Mr. Trump said, were “beyond reproach” and “spectacular,   people. ” But Mr. Trump said he also told Mr. Peña Nieto directly that he felt Mexico had benefited disproportionately from its trade agreements with the USA, and that he had described illegal immigration as a problem for both countries. Mr. Trump said the two did not discuss the issue of forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall  —   one of the signature promises of his campaign. Mr. Peña Nieto did not challenge the idea during the news conference but later posted on Twitter that, during his meeting with Mr. Trump, he had made it clear that Mexico wouldn't pay for the wall. Mr. Peña Nieto pushed back in the gentlest of terms on several of Mr. Trump's claims on Nafta, citing U. S. Chamber of Commerce statistics to argue that free trade had been beneficial for both countries and stressing the economic importance of easy movement across the border. Without mentioning specific remarks by Mr. Trump, Mexico's president said that hurtful comments had been made. “Mexican nationals in the USA are honest people, working people,” he said, adding, “Mexicans deserve everybody's respect. ” But Mr. Peña Nieto stopped well short of scolding Mr. Trump on the international stage. On the contrary, he expressed optimism that they could work together if Mr. Trump was elected president, “even though we do not agree on everything. ” The showing was something of a surprise, considering the sense of betrayal among many Mexicans, who feel that their president sold them out to the worst possible person. By the start time of 11 a. m. there were dozens of journalist but only a few protesters. A   later, the number of protesters  —   at least those being vocal and carrying   signs  —   seemed stuck at four, including a guy wearing a Mexican wrestling mask, while the number of journalists topped 50. By 12:30 p. m. there were no more than 10 demonstrators, while the journalist pack continued to balloon. Still, the protesters did their best to represent the anger and disappointment that many Mexicans have expressed toward Mr. Trump as well as toward Mr. Peña Nieto, who is struggling with low approval ratings and a string of scandals. He has spoken out sharply against Mr. Trump in the past, saying in a television interview last month that there was “no way” Mexico would pay for a border wall, and earlier comparing Mr. Trump's campaign to the rise of Hitler. “The president didn't represent the Mexican people, he didn't consult with us,” said the demonstrator in the wrestling mask, who called himself “Maldito Perro”  —   Damned Dog  —   though later said his real name was Diego Garcia. He admitted to being disappointed by the anemic turnout.

But Mr. Trump said he also told Mr. Pea Nieto directly that he felt Mexico had benefited disproportionately from its trade agreements with the USA, and that he had described illegal immigration as a problem for both countries. Mr. Trump said the two did not discuss the issue of forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall     one of the signature promises of his campaign. Mr. Pea Nieto did not challenge the idea during the news conference but later posted on Twitter that, during his meeting with Mr. Trump, he had made it clear that Mexico wouldn't pay for the wall. Mr. Pea Nieto pushed back in the gentlest of terms on several of Mr. Trump's claims on Nafta, citing U. S. Chamber of Commerce statistics to argue that free trade had been beneficial for both countries and stressing the economic importance of easy movement across the border. Without mentioning specific remarks by Mr. Trump, Mexico's president said that hurtful comments had been made. Mexican nationals in the USA are honest people, working people, he said, adding, Mexicans deserve everybody's respect.  But Mr. Pea Nieto stopped well short of scolding Mr. Trump on the international stage. On the contrary, he expressed optimism that they could work together if Mr. Trump was elected president, even though we do not agree on everything.  The showing was something of a surprise, considering the sense of betrayal among many Mexicans, who feel that their president sold them out to the worst possible person. By the start time of 11 a. m. there were dozens of journalist but only a few protesters. A   later, the number of protesters     at least those being vocal and carrying   signs     seemed stuck at four, including a guy wearing a Mexican wrestling mask, while the number of journalists topped 50. By 12:30 p. m. there were no more than 10 demonstrators, while the journalist pack continued to balloon. Still, the protesters did their best to represent the anger and disappointment that many Mexicans have expressed toward Mr. Trump as well as toward Mr. Pea Nieto, who is struggling with low approval ratings and a string of scandals. He has spoken out sharply against Mr. Trump in the past, saying in a television interview last month that there was no way Mexico would pay for a border wall, and earlier comparing Mr. Trump's campaign to the rise of Hitler. The president didn't represent the Mexican people, he didn't consult with us, said the demonstrator in the wrestling mask, who called himself Maldito Perro     Damned Dog     though later said his real name was Diego Garcia. He admitted to being disappointed by the anemic turnout. Social media activity, he lamented, seemed to be replacing the   tradition of the street protest."
9,3799,21502,All Impeachments Are Political. But Was Brazil's Something More Sinister? - The NY Times,NY Times,Amanda Taub,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   Was the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff as the president of Brazil on Wednesday a coup? Technically, the answer is no. Although there is no single definition of what constitutes a coup, it is at its core an illegal seizure of power. The Brazilian Senate's    vote to remove Ms. Rousseff was the culmination of a legal process set forth in the Brazilian Constitution, and it simply does not meet that standard. But Ms. Rousseff and her supporters have argued for months that the effort to oust her was in fact a coup engineered by a small group of elites. They are not bothered by strict legal definitions. Rather, “coup” has become shorthand for accusing Ms. Rousseff's political opponents of exploiting the law to subvert democracy. There is truth to that. But it is rooted in problems that afflict Brazil's entire political system, not just its right or its left. Any opposition party anywhere stands to gain from the downfall of the governing party's leader. In Brazil, that was heightened by the fact that members of the opposition had been caught up in a major corruption scandal. Romero Jucá, an influential opposition legislator who had been implicated in the scandal, was recorded in March saying of the investigation, “We have to change the government to be able to stop this bleeding. ” Ms. Rousseff was impeached on what analysts near universally described as minor charges: concealing a budget deficit by borrowing from a   bank  —   illegal, but not a criminal offense. Amy Erica Smith, an assistant political science professor at Iowa State University who studies Brazil, said these charges “don't rise to the level of the kind of accusations that would merit impeachment,” adding: “It's not a legitimate use of the impeachment proceedings. ” This is why Ms. Rousseff and her allies argued that the politicians pushing impeachment were not trying to protect the integrity of Brazilian democracy, but, rather, to manipulate it to serve their own ends. Calling the impeachment a coup became a way to question the motives of opposition leaders and to argue that impeaching Ms. Rousseff would be contrary to democracy. Normally, following the law  —   which the impeachers were indeed doing  —   by design serves democracy. But, in Brazil, there is currently just enough corruption and just enough rule of law for political elites to play the two against each other. Corruption, Professor Smith explained, is so endemic in Brazilian politics that it most likely implicates the entire governing class. The country also has a powerful judiciary that is actively working to investigate and prosecute corruption  —   an unstable combination. This gives political elites both a means and an incentive to expose their rivals, knowing it will probably ruin them. After all, if everyone is corrupt, everyone is vulnerable. But while that serves individual politicians, it weakens the wider political system by introducing instability. And because Brazil's economy is doing so poorly, the public is, understandably, angry at the government and eager to see corruption punished. So while Ms. Rousseff's supporters might see this impeachment as a cynical ploy, her opponents see a symbolic blow against a corrupt system  —   even if that corruption extends across party lines. There is also an important class dimension playing out. Ms. Rousseff led the   Workers Party, which positions itself as a champion of the poor. The opposition Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, which pushed for Ms. Rousseff's ouster and took power after she was suspended from office in May, is seen as a champion of business interests. In the eyes of Workers Party devotees, the impeachment proceedings had an element of class warfare, with the elite seizing power to protect their interests  —   which, to the other side, looks and feels like a coup even if it does not meet the formal definition. That perception was captured by a photograph, which went viral on social media, of a   couple in a wealthy neighborhood walking to a protest against President Rousseff in March while their maid pushed their children in a stroller alongside them. “When people talk about ‘coup mongers,' ” said Professor Smith, “they're often implicitly thinking about, you know, a rich white woman who is upset that her maid now is entitled to labor protections that limit what this rich white woman can ask her maid to do. ” But this view, promoted by Ms. Rousseff's staunchest supports, is something of a caricature. An April poll by the firm Datafolha found that 61 percent of Brazilians supported holding impeachment proceedings against Ms. Rousseff, and that her approval rating was a scant 13 percent. . So it is not the case, as some have argued, that Ms. Rousseff's impeachment was a coup in the sense that a handful of elites subverted the popular will. Nor have they, in these proceedings, gone outside the law. Rather, Ms. Rousseff's political opponents have done something subtler: They exploited the popular will and the letter of the law to serve their own interests, rather than the interests of democracy. Of course, in all countries, politicians act out of  . And impeachment proceedings are always political  —   something that any American who lived through President Bill Clinton's impeachment hearings can tell you. But the particular nature of Brazil's system at this moment makes its politics particularly unstable, and gives individual politicians greater power to leverage democracy toward ends that are not so democratic.",False,"WASHINGTON     Was the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff as the president of Brazil on Wednesday a coup?

10,3801,21504,Court Throws Out $655.5 Million Terrorism Verdict Against Palestinian Groups - The NY Times,NY Times,Benjamin Weiser,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"A federal appeals court in NY has thrown out a $655. 5 million verdict rendered last year that had held the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization liable for their roles in supporting terrorist attacks in Israel that claimed American lives. In reversing the verdict on Wednesday in the case, which drew the attention of the Obama administration, the appeals court did not minimize the impact of the six terrorist attacks, which occurred from 2002 to 2004, but it held that the Federal District Court in Manhattan had lacked the jurisdiction to hear the case. “The terror   attacks and suicide bombings that triggered this suit and victimized these plaintiffs were unquestionably horrific,” said a   panel of the USA Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan. “But the federal courts cannot exercise jurisdiction in a civil case beyond the limits prescribed by the due process clause of the Constitution,” the court added, “no matter how horrendous the underlying attacks or morally compelling the plaintiffs' claims. ” The plaintiffs included 10 families, comprising about three dozen people, eight of whom were physically injured in the attacks, as well as the estates of several victims who were killed. The suit was brought under the   Act, which provided for the tripling of the $218. 5 million in damages awarded by a Manhattan jury. The law, which allows USA citizens who are the victims of international terrorism to sue in the federal courts, was passed some years after the 1985 murder of Leon Klinghoffer in the Palestinian hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro. Kent A. Yalowitz, a lawyer for the families in the case, said in a statement that the law had been passed by Congress “to protect Americans wherever in the world they traveled. ” “The very terrorists who prompted the law have now hidden behind the U. S. Constitution to avoid responsibility for their crimes,” Mr. Yalowitz said. “This cruel decision must be corrected so that these families may receive justice. ” Mr. Yalowitz said the plaintiffs were weighing their options, which could include seeking review by the full appeals court, or asking the USA Supreme Court to hear the case. The attacks in Israel occurred on the street, at a crowded bus stop and inside a bus, and in a cafeteria on the Hebrew University campus. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the P. L. O. 's executive committee who testified for the defense in the trial, expressed satisfaction with the appeals court's decision, saying, “I hope this is the end of it. ” Speaking by telephone from Ramallah in the West Bank, Ms. Ashrawi said, “Finally the American justice system proved its impartiality. ” She added that the decision “restores my faith in the judicial system. ” The jury in the   trial, which ended in February 2015, heard emotional testimony from victims and witnesses in the attacks. But in finding that the federal court lacked jurisdiction, the appellate panel ruled that the connections between the Palestinian defendants and the USA were not sufficient to give the trial court the power to hear the plaintiffs' claims. Judge John G. Koeltl, writing for the panel, said the attacks in Israel had not been “expressly aimed at the USA,” and evidence presented by the plaintiffs had established the attacks' “random and fortuitous nature. ” “Evidence at trial showed that the shooters fired ‘indiscriminately,'” the judge wrote, “and chose sites for their suicide bomb attacks that were ‘full of people,' because they sought to kill ‘as many people as possible. '” The decision was joined by Judges Pierre N. Leval and Christopher F. Droney. The trial judge, George B. Daniels, had required the Palestinian Authority to post a bond of $10 million and an additional $1 million monthly to appeal the case. The bond is typically 111 percent of the judgment, but the authority said it could not afford that. Lawyers for the victims had objected to the lower amount, but the authority won support from an unexpected source: the Obama administration. Officials at the Justice and State Departments had asked Judge Daniels to consider the ramifications of requiring too high a bond, suggesting that doing so could cause economic and political harm to the Palestinian Authority and the broader peace process. “A P. A. insolvency and collapse would harm current and future U. S.  efforts to achieve a   solution to the   conflict,” Antony J. Blinken, the deputy secretary of state, said in a court filing in August 2015.

11,3803,21506,"Marc Riboud, Photojournalist Who Found Grace in the Turbulent, Dies at 93 - The NY Times",NY Times,Richard B. Woodward,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Marc Riboud, the celebrated French photojournalist who captured moments of grace even in the most fraught situations around the world, died in Paris on Tuesday. He was 93. The cause was Alzheimer's disease, his wife, Catherine Chaine, said. Mr. Riboud's career of more than 60 years carried him routinely to turbulent places throughout Asia and Africa in the 1950s and '60s, but he may be best remembered for two photographs taken in the developed world. The first, from 1953, is of a workman poised like an angel in overalls between a lattice of girders while painting the Eiffel Tower  —   one hand raising a paintbrush, one leg bent in a seemingly Chaplinesque attitude. The second, from 1967, is of a young woman presenting a flower to a phalanx of   members of the National Guard during an   War demonstration at the Pentagon. Both images were published in Life magazine during what is often called the golden age of photojournalism, an era Mr. Riboud (pronounced  ) exemplified. A protégé of Henri   he was on the front lines of world events, including wars. Even so, Mr. Riboud did not consider himself a record keeper. “I have shot very rarely news,” he once said. Rather than portray the military parades or political leaders of the Soviet Union, for example, he was drawn to anonymous citizens sitting in the snow, holding miniature chess boards and absorbed in their books. Of the many hundreds of shots he published from Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Pakistan, Tibet and Turkey, only a handful are of figures written about by historians. Born on June 24, 1923, in St.   near Lyon, he was the fifth and, by his account, the most shy of seven children from a bourgeois family that expected him to take up a respectable vocation. It was his father, an enthusiastic traveler and amateur photographer, who led him astray by giving him a   Kodak when Marc was a teenager. His first photographs were of the Paris Exposition in 1937. After World War II, in which he fought around Vercors as a member of the Resistance, Mr. Riboud studied mechanical engineering at the École Centrale in Lyon. He took a factory job in the nearby town of Villeurbanne after graduating in 1948. Not until he found himself taking pictures of a cultural festival in Lyon during a weeklong vacation in 1951 did he at last decide to commit to the unstable life of a freelance photojournalist. He moved to Paris in 1952. There he met   who became his mentor. Already a celebrity in his field, this “salutary tyrant,” as Mr. Riboud called him, dictated “which books to read, what political ideas I should have, which museums and galleries to visit. ” “He taught me about life and about the art of photography,” Mr. Riboud said. Among the lessons imparted was that “good photography” is dependent on “good geometry. ” The Eiffel Tower photograph from 1953, the first that Mr. Riboud published, proves how well the pupil absorbed the lesson. In a radio interview more than 50 years later, he still recalled the   caption given to the image by the Life copy writers: “  on the Eiffel. ” In 1953,   nominated his protégé to join Magnum, the photo collective he had helped found. Until 1979, when he left to go out on his own, Mr. Riboud traveled and photographed for the agency constantly. In 1955, he drove a specially equipped Land Rover to Calcutta from Paris, staying for a year in India. He was also one of the first Westerners to photograph in Communist China, and he spent three months in the Soviet Union in 1960. Throughout the 1950s and '60s he documented the anticolonial independence movements in Algeria and West Africa, and during the Vietnam War he was among the few able to move easily between the North and South. In the USA, he documented not only protests against the Vietnam War but also a pensive Maureen Dean listening to her husband, the Nixon aide John W. Dean, testify at the Watergate hearings in 1973. Among the events he documented in recent decades were the return of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to Iran the Solidarity movement in Poland the trial of Klaus Barbie, the Gestapo chief in Lyon during World War II the end of apartheid in South Africa and the mood in the USA before the election of Obama. During the last third of his life, Mr. Riboud was recognized by museums in many of the countries where he had worked. Photographs from his travels were collected in more than a dozen monographs, including “Marc Riboud: Photographs at Home and Abroad” (1986) “Marc Riboud: Journal” (1988) and “Marc Riboud in China: Forty Years of Photography” (1996). Among many other shows, Mr. Riboud was honored with exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago, in 1964, and the International Center of Photography in NY, in 1975, 1988 and 1997. He was the subject of retrospectives at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1985 and the Maison Européenne de la Photographie in Paris in 2004. Unlike some artists who resent that the public's infatuation with a few of their works has turned them into clichés, Mr. Riboud did not mind describing the circumstances behind “The Eiffel Tower Painter. ” No, he did not ask the workman to pose, he would answer patiently. To have spoken to the man might have caused him to slip. “I've always been shy, and I've always been trying to ignore the people I was photographing so that they ignore me,” he said. Of the flower girl at the Pentagon, a    high school student named Jan Rose Kasmir, he ventured, “I had the feeling the soldiers were more afraid of her than she was of the bayonets. ” (The two later reunited in London, where he photographed her carrying a poster of the 1967 image at a demonstration against the Iraq War in 2003.) The immense popularity of these two photographs, assisted by countless reproductions, could well have warped perceptions of Mr. Riboud's highly diverse body of work. And yet they did truly represent the gravitational bent of his personality. “I have always been more sensitive to the beauty of the world than to violence and monsters,” he wrote in an essay in 2000. “My obsession is with photographing life at its most intense as intensely as possible. It's a mania, a virus as strong as my instinct to be free. If taste for life diminishes, the photographs pale, because taking pictures is like savoring life at 125th of a second. ” In 1961, he married Barbara Chase, the American sculptor, poet and novelist. The marriage ended in divorce in the 1980s. Besides his second wife, Ms. Chaine, a journalist and author, Mr. Riboud is survived by two sons from his first marriage, David and Alexei and a daughter, Clémence, and a son, Théo, from his second marriage. Mr. Riboud's weakness for sentimental subjects and   causes marred his reputation with some critics. But this optimism, coupled with his overt sympathies for the downtrodden and a working style that put an emphasis on freedom of movement, unencumbered by any equipment except a camera and his wits, also served to keep him photographing until the end of his life. Until a few years ago, he would begin each day by loading film into his Canon EOS 300. “My vision of the world is simple,” Mr. Riboud said when he was in his 80s. “Tomorrow, each new day, I want to see the city, take new photographs, meet people and wander alone. ”",False,"Marc Riboud, the celebrated French photojournalist who captured moments of grace even in the most fraught situations around the world, died in Paris on Tuesday.

He was the subject of retrospectives at the Muse d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1985 and the Maison Europenne de la Photographie in Paris in 2004. Unlike some artists who resent that the public's infatuation with a few of their works has turned them into clichs, Mr. Riboud did not mind describing the circumstances behind The Eiffel Tower Painter.  No, he did not ask the workman to pose, he would answer patiently. To have spoken to the man might have caused him to slip. I've always been shy, and I've always been trying to ignore the people I was photographing so that they ignore me, he said. Of the flower girl at the Pentagon, a    high school student named Jan Rose Kasmir, he ventured, I had the feeling the soldiers were more afraid of her than she was of the bayonets.  (The two later reunited in London, where he photographed her carrying a poster of the 1967 image at a demonstration against the Iraq War in 2003.) The immense popularity of these two photographs, assisted by countless reproductions, could well have warped perceptions of Mr. Riboud's highly diverse body of work. And yet they did truly represent the gravitational bent of his personality. I have always been more sensitive to the beauty of the world than to violence and monsters, he wrote in an essay in 2000. My obsession is with photographing life at its most intense as intensely as possible. It's a mania, a virus as strong as my instinct to be free. If taste for life diminishes, the photographs pale, because taking pictures is like savoring life at 125th of a second.  In 1961, he married Barbara Chase, the American sculptor, poet and novelist. The marriage ended in divorce in the 1980s. Besides his second wife, Ms. Chaine, a journalist and author, Mr. Riboud is survived by two sons from his first marriage, David and Alexei and a daughter, Clmence, and a son, Tho, from his second marriage. Mr. Riboud's weakness for sentimental subjects and   causes marred his reputation with some critics. But this optimism, coupled with his overt sympathies for the downtrodden and a working style that put an emphasis on freedom of movement, unencumbered by any equipment except a camera and his wits, also served to keep him photographing until the end of his life. Until a few years ago, he would begin each day by loading film into his Canon EOS 300. My vision of the world is simple, Mr. Riboud said when he was in his 80s. Tomorrow, each new day, I want to see the city, take new photographs, meet people and wander alone. "

When Xian Gulin opened a halal restaurant in Shanghai last month that serves   beef noodles, he hoped patrons would line up at his door. What he got instead was an entrance blocked for weeks by protesters. The protesters, like Mr. Xian, were Hui, a Muslim ethnic minority, originally from China's northwest. They accused the restaurateur of violating the    Treaty, a social pact that prohibits the Hui from opening halal noodle shops within 400 meters of each other  —   roughly 1, 300 feet. To appease the protesters, Mr. Xian eventually agreed to take down the halal insignia from his storefront. The origins of the treaty are unknown, but restaurateurs say it originally capped the number of noodle shops in a Hui village at one.

The halal food industry has flourished in China as the country has pursued closer economic relations with   Middle Eastern nations. In Qinghai Province alone, sales of halal food products in 2014 totaled about $2. 8 billion. On Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, online commenters condemned the protests.

Yet enforcement of the treaty is increasingly difficult as halal cuisine becomes more popular across China. “It was a tradition in our villages back home, but I don't think anyone really respects this treaty anymore in large cities,” said Ma Kefu, 19, a Gansu native who now works at a halal restaurant in Beijing.

By Wired's estimation, it will be the first time a sitting president has   a magazine, a move the editor, Scott Dadich, described as a natural choice, given the nation's history of innovation. “When the founders wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, they were at the bleeding edge of enlightenment philosophy and technology,” Mr. Dadich said in the announcement. “Franklin was talking about crazy stuff like electricity and communications networks. Paine gave up the copyright to Common Sense so it could get wider publication. Jefferson was radically rethinking design and land use. ” At Mr. Obama's direction, the issue will focus on the future, the magazine said. Its theme will be frontiers: personal, local, national, international and beyond. (Think precision medicine, urban planning, civil rights, climate change and space travel.) That theme will also serve as the subject of a White House conference, a convening of innovators, to be held in Pittsburgh earlier in October and to be   by the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. The president is no stranger to science, technology and Silicon Valley, subjects central to Wired's coverage. His first presidential campaign is often credited to an effective use of big data and the internet. and he has championed several ambitious initiatives while in office, including plans to map the human brain and to get 20 million people subscribed to   internet by 2020. Last year, Mr. Obama famously dined late into the night at the White House with 13 guests, including Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn's   John Doerr, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Vinod Khosla, a founder of Sun Microsystems  —   part of a broader effort to prepare an infrastructure and endowment that would be used for, among other things, a “digital first” presidential library. Mr. Obama also courted support from Silicon Valley professionals, some of whom were rewarded for their efforts. John V. Roos, a major   and a former law firm partner there, was appointed ambassador to Japan after Mr. Obama first took office.

Franklin was talking about crazy stuff like electricity and communications networks. Paine gave up the copyright to Common Sense so it could get wider publication. Jefferson was radically rethinking design and land use.  At Mr. Obama's direction, the issue will focus on the future, the magazine said. Its theme will be frontiers: personal, local, national, international and beyond. (Think precision medicine, urban planning, civil rights, climate change and space travel.) That theme will also serve as the subject of a White House conference, a convening of innovators, to be held in Pittsburgh earlier in October and to be   by the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. The president is no stranger to science, technology and Silicon Valley, subjects central to Wired's coverage. His first presidential campaign is often credited to an effective use of big data and the internet. and he has championed several ambitious initiatives while in office, including plans to map the human brain and to get 20 million people subscribed to   internet by 2020. Last year, Mr. Obama famously dined late into the night at the White House with 13 guests, including Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn's   John Doerr, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Vinod Khosla, a founder of Sun Microsystems     part of a broader effort to prepare an infrastructure and endowment that would be used for, among other things, a digital first presidential library. Mr. Obama also courted support from Silicon Valley professionals, some of whom were rewarded for their efforts. John V. Roos, a major   and a former law firm partner there, was appointed ambassador to Japan after Mr. Obama first took office. The Wired arrangement won't be the president's first foray into editing, either. In 1990, he  became the first black editor in the history of the Harvard Law Review."

She was 71 and still hosting her daily   radio program. Her death was confirmed by her brother David Oppenheim, who did not give a cause. Beginning in 1978  —   when she was suddenly thrust onto the air because a hockey game had been canceled  —   Dr. Browne reached millions of radio listeners, many of whom revealed their concerns to her in cathartic   segments or emailed her their problems, which she read and responded to over the air. “She was the   psychologist on   radio at the time of her death,” Michael Harrison, the publisher of Talkers magazine, said in an email on Wednesday. “More importantly,” he added, “she kept the presence of the radio   show alive on terrestrial   radio at a time when the genre had all but dried up in favor of mostly conservative, political programming. ” On television, versions of her program appeared on CBS, with a studio audience, and on the Discovery Health cable channel. In contrast to other   psychologists, some of whom could come across as scolds, Dr. Browne was unflaggingly buoyant as she delivered   advice and gentle goading. “I'm in the business of helping make lives better,” she once said, “not by bashing but by teaching people how to take responsibility for their behavior. ” On a recent program she asked: “If we can figure out a way to get to the moon, wipe out disease, double life expectancy, don't you think we can be a little nicer to each other? Maybe. I know, I believe in the Easter bunny and the Tooth Fairy as well. ” With her advice came rules to live by, like these for couples: ¶If you're married, go on dates together (to keep the romance alive). ¶If you've gone through a divorce or a breakup, no dating for a year (to let you experience life on your own). ¶If you're both in love and either of you has children, get married (an unmarried state can be disruptive for younger children, who tend to become attached, and for teenagers, who are dealing with their own sexuality). The psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers, who became a fixture in American homes, made her television debut in the 1950s, but the roots of radio therapy are usually traced to Toni Grant, who started broadcasting on   in Los Angeles in 1975. (Dr. Grant died this year.) Dr. Browne was among those who followed in her footsteps, in her case on   (now WMEX) in Boston. “When I first started, the A. P. A. tried to take my license away,” Dr. Browne told The NY Times in 1996, referring to the American Psychological Association. In 1998, the group gave her an award under the rubric “outstanding contribution by a psychologist in the media. ” Dr. Browne found her niche in the 1970s, at a time when seeking professional help was still stigmatized and family and community support networks had weakened. Radio gave people wrestling with emotional issues the safety of anonymity. She said she was as much concerned with moral and ethical issues as she was with mental health. “It's Problem Solving 101,” she said in 1996 (while acknowledging that some listeners might consider it “Voyeurism 102”). Indeed, Dr. Frank Farley, a former president of the psychological association and a professor at Temple University, said in a phone interview on Wednesday that   programs like Dr. Browne's were more successful at offering practical advice on ethical issues than at providing actual therapy in public. “You can't give therapy to people you haven't seen,” he said. He added: “Joy Browne was certainly among the best of the media psychologists. She was very solid,   in psychology, and wasn't going to be shooting from the lip. ” She was born Joy Oppenheim on Oct. 24, 1944, in New Orleans, the daughter of Nelson Oppenheim, a life insurance salesman, and the former Ruth Strauss, a teacher. She was raised in Pennsylvania and Denver and graduated from Rice University in Houston with a degree in behavioral science.

That was when she was recruited by WITS. “I found something in my life I was good at and could help more people in one hour than I could in one year,” Dr. Browne told Talkers magazine last year.

WITS had scheduled her to begin broadcasting in October 1978, but weeks earlier she was summoned one night without warning to fill in when a scheduled broadcast of a Bruins hockey game was abruptly canceled the ice had melted at Boston Garden. Her mission, she said, was to persuade depressed listeners that they could change only their   not those of the people who might be causing them stress. “They want to know how to kill the person who is making them feel that way and not be held responsible,” she told Talkers. “The only behavior I can help change is yours, but that isn't what a caller wants to hear. They want me to tell them that the other person is to blame. ” She also learned, she said, that “one secret to doing a great interview is listening,” a skill she had already developed as a therapist. Certain topics were taboo, she said, including abortion, “because you will never change anyone's mind,” and horoscopes, “because it will get phone calls  —   but no listeners. ” Partisan politics was also off limits. After another radio stint in California, Dr. Browne joined the WOR Radio Network in NY, which in the early 1990s sent her program into national syndication. She remained at WOR until it was sold in 2012. She then shifted to Radio America and finally to Genesis Communications Network, where her midday program was still being broadcast on more than 100 stations at her death.

In addition to her brother David, she is survived by a daughter, Patience three sisters, Jane Russo, Judy Hawkins and Alannah Sinclaire and another brother, Daniel Oppenheim.

17,5071,22918,Fight - The NY Times,NY Times,Dan Barry,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"PART 1 YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio  —   Numbered balls of chance rattle and rise two nights a week down at the cavernous community hall of Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church. It's called a good bingo when your number comes up. But that last Saturday before Christmas offered no good bingos. The night was reserved for a boxing event billed as Season's Beatings, which had prompted a newspaper deliveryman named Anthony Taylor to pull up in his clattering Dodge Caravan.   years old, 5 feet tall, 115 pounds, about to turn pro. A fist of nerves, he walked down the   stairwell to the finished basement, a space used for church dances and wedding banquets, but now an open locker room. Chandeliers glittered above the fighters trying to warm up and calm down, while the crowds upstairs cheered on the amateurs, including a      who would knock out his   opponent. Taylor had longed for this moment. All those years of being picked on because of his size, all those street fights, all that anger needing redirection toward something constructive  —   all down to this. He had his hair in ropy dreadlocks and his   shorts,   for $300, pulled high on his hardened torso. Portable curtains in the basement separated the hometown favorites from the    the A's from the B's. Someone smart about boxing could walk in cold and tell which side was which. The local fighters are usually a notch above, in better shape, expected to win. But Taylor's   trainer, Jack Loew, heard this hammering sound, a whap, whap,   from the curtain's other side. He peeked and saw a sinewy teenager in    shorts pounding the outstretched mitts of his trainer with uncommon discipline.  . “We got a fighter,” Loew said to somebody. Taylor was on his own side of the divide, warming up, when the curtain briefly parted to reveal his opponent. They made eye contact. “Nothing like anger,” Taylor recalled. “Both nervous. Just looking at each other. ” The curtain closed. A Life of Taking Punches and Unleashing His Own “Five foot even. ” That's how Anthony Taylor describes his height. Not a   higher or lower. Five foot even. When you're 9 inches shorter than the average man, abuse will find you. But Taylor was determined from an early age to prove his true stature the only way he knew. “Street fighting,” he says. His mother, an   factory worker, and his father, a handyman, split up before he was in kindergarten, so he bounced around a little. Moving from the small Ohio city of Warren to Youngstown, then down to Jackson, Tenn. he learned that broken families were tough on children, and that bullies were ubiquitous. “I was always the smallest guy in the neighborhood, so I had a lot of people picking on me,” Taylor said. “I really didn't go around looking for trouble. It just seemed to find me because I was so small. ” “And I had a bad attitude,” he added. One day the manager of a gym in Jackson saw this small angry kid giving as good as he got, and invited him to do something with those quick hands and quicker rage. The kid began to learn. “Somebody hit you, hit you really hard, and you want to do something back,” Taylor said. “But when you think about it, you can't fight when you're angry. Boxing is a thinking game. ” Taylor followed the amateur circuit  —   Florida, Alabama, Arkansas, Nevada  —   earning a reputation as a boxer who kept on coming. At a fight one night in Little Rock, his trainer called out, “Go get him, Tiger. ” The nickname stuck. He tried a semester of community college, but higher education wasn't for him, at least not yet. Sometimes the classes would run over time, and he'd be late to the gym. College could wait, he figured boxing could not. He had his career goals. “To be at the top of the ladder,” he said. “Number one. Champion. ” Missing his family back north, Taylor returned to Ohio. He lives with his fiancée, Tiera Glover, their    daughter and her two sons in Warren, in a worn house with green plastic furniture planted under the porch's sagging roof. They cover the $600 monthly rent by delivering 250 copies of The Tribune Chronicle, a Warren newspaper, every morning. And every afternoon, except on days when he can't afford the gas, Taylor drives his knocking Dodge Caravan, with its car seat and little girl toys, the 20 miles to Youngstown  —   to Jack Loew's South Side Boxing Club, his   sanctuary, where boxing gloves hang from nails like holiday ornaments. The club stands out along a   stretch of Market Street. Some years ago, its owner, Jack Loew, hired a resident of a nearby halfway house for convicts to paint the exterior red and black. The artist also painted a pair of boxing gloves, enveloped in a wreath of stars that can convey dreamlike glory or a concussive haze. Loew is 56,   and as squat and solid as his building. He boxed as an amateur before focusing on a college football career that ended after several knee operations. He became a Teamster, lost the warehouse job he thought would last to retirement, worked construction and started his own   company. He also opened this club in 1989, as if in homage to what his hometown had once been. Youngstown was a pugnacious steel city of 167, 000 when Loew was born, with boxing clubs anchored in many neighborhoods. This is where his childhood friend Ray Mancini  —   Boom Boom  —   learned how to become a world lightweight champion. A   later, Youngstown is down to a population of 65, 000, a hemorrhaging of 100, 000 people caused by   closings, a failure to diversify and the absence, so far, of a sustainable second act. Lost in the exodus were some signature parts of the Youngstown culture, including many boxing clubs. But Loew took a shot. He opened his gym on Southern Boulevard, moved to an ancient brick building on Erie Street, then settled here, on the city's tough south side. No problems so far, save for that time someone removed a massive tractor tire from the gym and rolled it like a determined Sisyphus up and down the hilly neighborhood  —   only to return the tire the next day. His excuse was simple: Just wanted to see if I could do it, Coach. Two decades ago, a scrappy    kid from the south side's Slovak neighborhood came to Loew's gym looking to learn how to box. This kid, Kelly Pavlik, went on to become the Ghost, an electrifying, dominant boxer with a drinking problem. He abruptly quit in 2013, saying he feared the   medical impact of his chosen career. “Kelly picked my door to come through,” said Loew, who is called Coach Jack by his boxers. “We were always crowded, but when we won middleweight champion of the world.   …    ” No need to finish the sentence: Pavlik's success was good for Jack Loew's South Side Boxing Club. It attracted a lot of locals looking to make their mark, including a superflyweight named Anthony Taylor. “A   Joe Frazier,” Loew said. This is boxing code for saying that Taylor keeps coming at you, takes a punch to give a punch, and has fists that hit like anvils. Taylor couldn't remain an amateur forever. Loew needed to find him a professional opponent, maybe for the Season's Beatings event that he had set up for the week before Christmas at the Ukrainian hall. But flyweights and bantamweights  —   who weigh less than half the reigning heavyweight champion, Tyson Fury  —   are hard to come by in this part of the country. A couple of weeks before Christmas, though, a trainer from Detroit who was bringing in two amateurs for the boxing night offered a solution. He said that he could supply a flyweight who, like Taylor, was itching to turn pro. Two Partners Engaging in a Dangerous Dance The ding of a bell in a church hall transformed two slight young men into professional fighters, hired to withstand blows to body and head while trying to pound each other out of consciousness. Their pay for the   fight: $300 for Taylor and $500 for his    opponent, since he was coming in from 200 miles away. Moments earlier they had stood with heads bowed, their coaches massaging their backs as the referee went over final details. Then they had tapped gloves, a gesture conveying   solidarity between strangers, known to each other only through a stolen glance across that parted curtain. Anthony Taylor danced the cautionary dance with his partner, head bobbing, looking for a moment to strike. He prided himself on his patience. But when the opponent tested with a tentative, catlike thrust, Taylor responded with a wild swing that punched only air, betraying his overeagerness. Then came a   scrum, left right left right. Violent contact made. The crowd aahed in approval. More than 700 people had turned out. Loew, the promoter as well as Taylor's trainer, had charged $20 for general admission and $50 for ringside, while also managing to sell more than two dozen corporate tables. But after covering expenses that included the referee, the hall and ring rentals, and the hotel rooms for    boxers, Loew would take in just $382 for his eight weeks of work. At least his choice of location and timing  —   a Ukrainian church hall in late December  —   ensured a festive touch to the boxing event. A decorated Christmas tree sparkled in the corner. A    Ukrainian flag hung over the water fountain. A Christmas wreath and bright lights hung beside signs that said, “Valid Bingo Is Ball Called  —   Not Off Monitor” and “Early Bird Winner Take All. ” Instead of calls of “ ” and “” though, there arose the grunts of boxers, the whacks of leather against flesh, the cries and sighs of spectators in thrall. Some of the loudest shouts came from Taylor's friends and family members. “Come on, Ant'! You got this!” Taylor crouched as he stalked, making his   frame even smaller before springing like a    . He connected with a left that sent his opponent back, and kept on coming. He ducked under a swing, came over the top and delivered another left that knocked the fighter in red and white down into the ropes. As Taylor retreated to his corner, fans were shouting: “He's done, he's done! Stop the fight!” Seconds later, Taylor struck again. “His guard came down, and I hit him with a straight left hand,” he recalled. A second knockdown, although this time his opponent got up quickly, adjusting his trunks as if the fall had been nothing more than a wardrobe malfunction. Then Taylor found himself reeling backward, almost comically, after taking a hard left to the head. He responded with a punch that he thought connected for a delayed knockdown others saw more of a phantom punch and stumble. Still, Loew recalled, “If the ref had stopped the fight, I don't think anyone would have complained. ” The bell clanged. Taylor slumped to his corner, exhausted from all that he had expended trying to end the fight. He drank some water and listened to encouraging words from Loew, who struggled to be heard over the    music pounding out of the sound system. Then, again, came the bell's beckoning. Taylor found his opponent waiting for him at the center of the ring, as if awakened by the knockdowns of the previous round. Soon there came a left that bounced Taylor off the ring's    ropes. “Anthony!” someone pleaded. But Taylor could not yet find the wind or strength. “I threw out a lot of gas in the first round by me trying to finish him off,” he said later. “You're trying to hurry up and get done with the fight. And that's where the turnaround was in the second round. ” “Knock him out,” someone in Taylor's corner shouted. Then: “Get him! Get him!” And: “Let's go, Tiger!” And: “Put him down, Ant'!” Taylor took quick rights to the jaw, another hard right that rocked him, then a left and a right. Gloved fists pounded his many tattoos: the “R. I. P. ” on his right shoulder that honors a brother shot to death (“Wrong place, wrong time,” he says) the    on his left shoulder that reminds him he's a jewel in the rough the dice and playing cards adorning his chest, along with the inscription: “Life A Gamble. ” Tension and Triumph, Confusion and Dread The bell. Another squirt of water. More of Coach Jack's encouragement, only now sounding urgent. The passing blur of a young woman holding aloft a placard announcing Round 3. The bell. And there was Taylor's opponent again, at the center of the ring, waiting. Taylor connected with a roundhouse left, but his opponent returned with a   insult to the chin. Taylor seemed   almost disengaged, as if exhaustion had displaced his purpose. “Let's go, little man!” someone called out. But Taylor's coach was more concrete. “Breathe, breathe!” Loew was shouting. “You gotta push it, Anthony!” Taylor did revive, holding his own until the bell. He was convinced the round was a tossup, but his coach knew otherwise. “Anthony was gassed in the third round, and took an ” Loew said. Now it was the fourth and last round, the final three minutes, and there again was his opponent, waiting. Taylor knew this was it  —   “an    thing,” he called it. His dreadlocks swayed as he danced and dodged, as he punched and received punches. It went this way, a study in mundane violence, for most of the first two minutes. Toe to toe. But then Taylor suddenly had his opponent near the ropes. He threw a right that either glanced off the boxer or missed him entirely. The opponent fell backward to all but sit on the apron. Trying to capitalize, Taylor threw a left. But the opponent ducked to his right and stumbled forward, head sweeping briefly against Taylor's chest, arms outstretched, looking for something to hold on to, as if the blue mat had been pulled from beneath him. He looped his left arm around Taylor's torso as he fell onto his right knee, his lower body gone limp, his black gloves down in sudden vulnerability. The referee waved his arms. Fight over! He bent down to help the opponent, who reached up with his right hand. Halfway to his feet, the boxer wobbled and fell back down. The sudden uncertainty disrupted the order in the ring. The opponent's coach had slipped through the ropes and was now trying to help his fighter, who struggled again to rise, only to sway and fall back against his coach's shins. My knee, he was saying. My knee. Loew was also in the ring, yelling to Bernie Profato, the director of the Ohio Athletic Commission, sitting at ringside, that the round hadn't ended, and you can't have people coming into the ring, and that was a knockdown.   …     “Your kid's gotta hit him for a knockdown,” Profato called back. Mere noise. The fight was over. The opponent lay on his back as some people hovered over him, including the ringside doctor  —   a dermatologist  —   now slipping on a pair of surgical gloves. Taylor, meanwhile, knew only that he had won. He raised an arm and took a few courtly bows. But a shadow of dread was settling over this decorated bingo hall masquerading as a boxing arena. A fallen man was not rising, not rising, still not rising. His eyes were closed. Medics were climbing into the ring. “You knew,” Loew said. “You knew right then and there. ” You knew right then and there. The loser, this kid from Michigan named Hamzah Aljahmi, now   was unconscious. And the winner, Anthony Taylor, now   was sobbing. PART 2 DEARBORN, Mich.  —   The amateur boxer slept. Huddled in the passenger seat of his family's sport utility vehicle, he rocked in slumber as his father drove out of Dearborn, then south and east around Lake Erie, verses from the Quran intoning softly from the speakers. Now and then the boxer would rouse long enough for a snatch of small talk. But soon his eyes would close again, and he would sleep through the December blur of Rust Belt towns and   fields, right to the edge of the Ohio city where he was to fight his first professional fight. Youngstown. This was Hamzah Aljahmi, 19, the oldest child and best friend of the man behind the wheel, Ali Aljahmi. The   permit dangling from the rearview mirror hinted of the father's   worries, but no matter how bad things got, he knew that he could always confide in this beautiful   beside him, sleeping now to the   rhythms. How could he deny his son's passionate dream to box his way to fame and fortune? To become the pride of Dearborn? Of Yemeni people everywhere? This was Hamzah's destiny: to make his professional debut at a Christmastime boxing event called Season's Beatings. Hamzah's father had followed a different path. Born in Yemen, he had immigrated to Brooklyn, left high school without graduating  —   joked around too much, he says  —   and begun a life of manual labor. Store work. Factory work. Lifting and moving. He gravitated to Dearborn, the world headquarters of the Ford Motor Company, where   of the nearly 100, 000 residents are  : Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi, Palestinian, Yemeni. Here are the Henry Ford museum and the Arab American National Museum, plants that make the   truck and restaurants that make fahsa, a seasoned lamb stew that is shared with others and scooped with torn pieces of flatbread. Now Ali Aljahmi was the married father of five, disabled by a   injury and living in a   neighborhood, a block from a massive factory. But he was an Aljahmi, a member of a fiercely proud extended Yemeni family with deep roots in two cultures. The Aljahmis, the Eljahmis, the Algahmis, the Aljahims  —   all there for him, and he for them. Above all, he was there for Hamzah, his elder son, the boxer. Years earlier, when the family was living in Detroit, three kids ganged up on skinny young Hamzah Aljahmi. The boy held his own in the mismatch, prompting an onlooker to give grudging respect: Your son is one tough character. Sensing a purpose in life, Hamzah began training with one of his idols, Brian Mihtar, a prominent   middleweight boxer known as Brian the Lion, who compiled a   record, with 10 knockouts, before suspending his career in 2010. He took a liking to this fledgling boxer, who showed both talent and heart. “Like a brother,” Mihtar said. When Mihtar closed his gym, Aljahmi and his father searched the Detroit area for someone who could make the boy   someday. They eventually chose Mohamed Hamood, or Coach Mo, a muscular former Marine with a shaved head who builds houses to support his family and his boxing fix. The amateur's determination and focus impressed Hamood. The boy had phenomenal hand speed, an ability to slip punches, and surprising pop for a flyweight. But his tendency to fight with his chin up often left him dangerously exposed it was almost as if he were daring to be hit. Still, Hamood said, “a very hard worker  —   very hard. ” Hamzah Aljahmi fought more than a score of amateur matches, winning most and learning from all. Turning pro became his obsession, his father said: “All the time, his mind go to the boxing. ” He admired the ferocious boxers of Yemeni blood. Sadam Ali, the tough welterweight from Brooklyn. Mohamed Adam, the young superfeatherweight from Dearborn. His former coach, the Lion, Brian Mihtar. And, of course, Prince Naseem, whose image even served for a while as the wallpaper on Aljahmi's smartphone. True, the young man had other interests. He attended prayer services. Doted on his mother and younger siblings. Abided high school, barely. Kept girls at a safe but friendly distance. Worked at a Tim Horton's doughnut shop and then at the American Coney Island restaurant, serving hot dogs smothered in chili and onions. But it was boxing that defined him. He craved cranberry juice, shunned bread and spent most of his spare time in Hamood's gym, in Dearborn Heights, working out, sparring with heavier partners, itching to fight for a living. “He was bugging me to go pro when he was 17,” Hamood, 55, recalled. “And I'd say, ‘Let's take our time.' ” Some friends and relatives approached the inherent violence of Aljahmi's passion delicately, occasionally suggesting that he give up the ring. Others accepted that he knew who he was, and admired him for it. He talked of becoming champion and parlaying his   fame in a way that would help others in need  —   in   Yemen and beyond. Remember when he helped to collect clothes for Syrian refugees? And somehow persuaded his father to donate his three favorite coats? Remember that saying he used to repeat? “You laugh at me because I'm different I laugh at you because you're all the same. ” Mohammad Yacoubi, 19, a classmate of Aljahmi's and one of his closest friends, shrugged in mock surrender while trying to explain the young man's charms. He had no enemies, he was respectful to his mother and father, he loved his siblings, and he was loyal to his friends. “Just a special kid,” Yacoubi said. Opportunity came in early December, when Coach Mo Hamood struck a deal to have Aljahmi fight in Youngstown against another amateur who was also turning pro. “He was ready,” Hamood said of his young flyweight. Aljahmi girded for the day. After telling his father that a door had opened, he posted a photograph on Instagram of his application for a Michigan boxing license, along with a note sharing the date of his debut fight  —   “DECEMBER 19th”  —   and asking people to come support him. “Alhamdulillah. ” Praise be to God. Making Final Preparations and Planning to Celebrate As the S. U. V. approached the outskirts of Youngstown, some three hours after leaving Dearborn, Hamzah Aljahmi stirred into consciousness. Looking around, he said that it was his turn to drive. His father laughed but surrendered the wheel. Father and son headed to the prefight   at a government building in downtown Youngstown. The younger Aljahmi's     manner impressed the director of the Ohio Athletic Commission, a retired police officer and former referee named Bernie Profato  —   so much so that Profato told him, win or lose, “You'll be welcome back in Ohio anytime. ” After the   Aljahmi joined his coach and the two amateurs from Dearborn, including an    with a preternatural punching ability, for some   at a Carrabba's Italian restaurant, not far from their rooms at the Red Roof Inn. Aljahmi had pasta with cream sauce. Before the night was over, the eager boxer posted one last photograph of himself on Instagram. Big smile. Throwing a right fist at the camera. “Ready for 2mrw fight night everyone keep me in ur prayers inshallah,” he wrote. If Allah wills it. The next morning, Aljahmi and his father ate breakfast at an IHOP  —   eggs and turkey sausage for more weight gain  —   then returned to the hotel for a short rest and the long wait. Since the next day would be the father's 51st birthday, the two Aljahmis talked about getting a cake. “Win and we'll celebrate twice,” the father promised. With the time drawing near, they drove with Coach Mo and his two young amateurs to the    community hall of Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church, on Youngstown's west side. Joining them were four friends who had driven from Dearborn in a cramped   Toyota. Down in the hall's chandeliered basement, where curtains separated boxers from the opponents they were about to meet, young Aljahmi chatted away as his coach prepared him for his debut. While Aljahmi sat with his arms propped on a white towel draped over a chair back, Coach Mo wrapped his boxer's hands in protective gauze, carefully, almost clinically. He then slipped   gloves over those hands and tied the strings. Finally, to cut down on the rudeness of leather against skin, he applied petroleum jelly with his fingertips to the unlined brow, the fresh cheeks, and the chin too often left exposed in the rashness of youth. There was one last detail. With his first professional fight just moments away, Aljahmi still had no nickname. But if his opponent  —   a short fighter he had seen when the curtain between them suddenly opened  —   was calling himself the Tiger, then how about something just as feral? How about the Lion? Agreed. A protective entourage  —   his father, his coach, a few friends  —   escorted Aljahmi up the basement steps and into the   auditorium, a   bingo hall set up for a boxing event. Now here he was, for the night's first professional fight, a   in the superflyweight division. In    shorts with matching red shoes, the dynamo from Dearborn. The pride of the   community. His father's best friend. Hamzah “the Lion” Aljahmi. A Sudden Shift in Mood After the Opening Bell Before the first bell, Aljahmi had told Coach Mo that this was his time. I'm ready, Coach, he had said. Let's get this thing going. Now it was going, but not well. Aljahmi's opponent was quick, active, and crouched so small that he made for a difficult target. The sight of their Hamzah being pummeled startled his friends, who had been harboring a more abstract understanding of what it meant to box professionally. Then down Aljahmi went, tagged by a powerful left. His opponent had capitalized on the weakness that Coach Mo had been working on: the “boxing ” he called it, of leaving the chin exposed. “It felt like a movie when he went down,” Aljahmi's friend Mohammad Yacoubi said. “He had gone into that ring like a superhero. ” A few seconds later, Aljahmi went down a second time, forcing Coach Mo to make quick assessments. His young boxer was more “wobbly” after the first knockdown, the coach later said, after taking a punch that was “right on the button. ” But the second one? “He had a little wobble,” he said. “But he can go. ” Aljahmi did bounce up quickly. He adjusted his trunks  —   as if recalibrating body and mind  —   and went back to work. Becoming more aggressive, he delivered a hard left that had his opponent backpedaling. Then, while trying to avoid a swing that seemed to hit more air than flesh, Aljahmi fell against the ropes. He might have simply tripped, but it was not an impressive way to end the first round. Two knockdowns and one stumble. He returned to his corner charged with energy. What did I do wrong, Coach? “Hamzah, your chin is way up in the air,” Hamood recalled saying. “And your right hand is down. ” Aljahmi went out to own the second round, exploiting his opponent's fatigue and blocking out the shouts of a Youngstown crowd eager to see this    fall. When the bell rang, he all but ran back to his corner after leaving his weary opponent on the ropes. “Great job,” Coach Mo told Aljahmi. “Let's keep doing what you're doing. Use your jab. No need to wrestle with him. ” Aljahmi looked at his clutch of friends in the seats, smiled, nodded his head  —   and returned to the ring to follow his coach's instructions exactly. Round 3 repeated Round 2. Although his opponent tagged him quickly with a left from nowhere, Aljahmi answered with a hard right to the chin. “There he goes!” Yacoubi, Aljahmi's friend, shouted. Soon another Aljahmi right found purchase. “There you go! There you go! He's tired! He's tired! Hamzah, he's tired!” This was true. Aljahmi's opponent was still recovering from having fought so aggressively in the first round. His own coach was shouting for him to push through it  —   which he did, briefly, during a   flurry. The bell rang just as Aljahmi uncorked one more punch. A little late, it seemed, but clearly accidental. He tapped his opponent's chest in apology. Coach Mo gave Aljahmi water and applied more petroleum jelly, that translucent touch of protection, to his eyebrows, cheeks and nose. “We need this round,” the coach said, as if to make clear to his boxer the tossup closeness of the fight. I got you, Coach. Aljahmi then leaned over, found his father in the crowd, and shook his right glove in a gesture that seemed to say now is the time. Now. He was so jacked up on adrenaline that he hurried to the center of the ring well before the bell. The   referee had to nudge him back a step or two, while his coach called after him that he was the toughest kid he knew. “Go get him,” Coach Mo commanded. The two superflyweights gave it their all, each determined not to lose his professional debut, as the crowd urged them on. “Give him one, Hamzah!” Aljahmi's friends shouted. “There you go! More! More!” “Get him, get him, get him!” “Hamzah, get him! Hamzah, he's done! He's done!” “Keep going!” Then  —   a punch to their friend's head. “Oooh!” Aljahmi, who had been dominating, was suddenly backed into a corner by his flailing opponent. “Get out of the corner!” a friend yelled. “Get out of the corner!” Too late. Their superhero was squat against the apron, dodging swings, lurching forward, grasping to hold on to something unseen, then falling, drooping, legs not cooperating, arms down. The referee stopped the fight, causing confusion about what had just happened. He tried to help Aljahmi to his feet, but the boxer could not find the strength. Panicking, Coach Mo rushed into the ring. “Good job, Hamzah!” he said, mistakenly thinking the bell had rung. “Get up. You won the fight!” I can't. My knee. I twisted my knee. He leaned back, or maybe fell back, onto Coach Mo's shins. Aljahmi's father and friends had just been shouting that his opponent was “done” now they were mute. A moment ago their Hamzah had been controlling the fight now he was propped against his coach's legs like a rag doll. A dermatologist serving as the ringside doctor slipped under the ropes and donned surgical gloves. The Lion lay flat on the mat. Then, Coach Mo said, “Hamzah closed his eyes. ” PART 3 YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio  —   The fearless young boxer feared what he would see, feared how he would be received. He lingered at the threshold of the surgical intensive care unit, unable to take those few short steps to the bedside of his comatose opponent. The boxer, Anthony Taylor, known for his        ferocity, froze under the unforgiving lights of crisis care at St. Elizabeth Youngstown Hospital, where a chorus of beeping monitors and exhaling respirators sang of lives at the precipice. He did not want to be here. That is, he wanted to be here, and his coach told him that he should be here, but he was frightened. In his gloveless hands he carried the shield of a bouquet, bright yellow flowers that were like dandelions, only nicer. A nurse asked if he needed help. Soon, a relative of the patient he had come to see invited him into a crowded room. There, in a small bed, with a white bandage wrapped around his head and a blue air tube running from his mouth, was the man Taylor had recently danced and fought with: Hamzah Aljahmi, 19, his eyes still closed. Taylor handed the flowers to someone and sat in a chair near the foot of the bed, stunned. To think that less than 72 hours earlier, he and this person had each been paid a few hundred dollars to fight their first professional fight, a   in the hall of a Ukrainian church. To think how they had stared into each other's eyes while engaged in a most violent form of intimacy. It could be    Anthony Taylor in that bed, not Hamzah Aljahmi. Now Anthony would be spending the holidays with his family, while Hamzah.   …     The visitor began to cry. Ali Aljahmi, a first cousin, was moved, even impressed, by the sight of this distraught stranger paying his respects. For you to step into this room of anger and grief, Aljahmi thought to himself. For you to come to be with us. Takes a lot of strength. The cousin led Taylor into the hall to offer comforting perspective. Whatever was happening in that hospital room was Allah's will, he said, and do not doubt that you helped Hamzah to realize his dream of becoming a professional boxer. One more thing, Aljahmi said. “You have become family with me forever for this kind of gesture. ” Taylor returned to the room and, for the next hour, talked with the father, an uncle and a few cousins of the man laid out before them, the black of his eyebrows enhanced by an enveloping whiteness of bandages and blankets. “They told me they wanted me to keep going,” Taylor recalled. “That he would want me to keep going, and that I have to honor him and keep him alive by continuing to box. ” The father, also named Ali Aljahmi, would only vaguely remember Taylor's visit, so   were his waves of grief. He had been at the fight. He had seen his beloved son, a determined fighter, crumple to the blue mat. Not in direct response to any punch, it seemed, but almost as an afterthought. The elder Aljahmi had been here in this chilling, antiseptic environment ever since, save for when nurses would gently tell him it was time to leave for the night. He'd return to a hotel whose name he would not remember and try to avoid the many anxious telephone calls from family members and friends back in their hometown of Dearborn. How is Hamzah? How is Hamzah? How is Hamzah? The father did not want to answer. If he did respond, it was to tell a version of the truth: “Hamzah is sleeping. ” Finally, the father telephoned a nephew in Dearborn with the same name as his: Ali Aljahmi, Hamzah's cousin. I need you to bring Hamzah's mother here to Youngstown, Ali. She needs to see him. The nephew understood what his uncle was not saying. He did as he was told. He packed Hamzah's mother, Jamilah Aljahmi, and other relatives into a borrowed Chevy Cruze and began to drive, listening to them cry because Hamzah had been injured, but knowing that worse news awaited them in Youngstown. The mother saw her child wrapped in white, as if already prepared for the coffin. She held his feet, felt warmth, and in her profound grief exclaimed that he was alive! All this was too much for her health, it was decided. A relative drove Hamzah's mother and the other women back to Dearborn. To wait for what was to be. But the father clung to hope as his son had clung to the ropes. He arose one morning in that strange hotel feeling as though all would be well. These efficient people in lab coats and nursing outfits would find some   equivalent of smelling salts, and his son's eyes would open. Finally, though, the father let go. Shedding his stoicism, he collapsed onto his son's chest and begged between sobs that Hamzah rise and come with him to IHOP for another restorative meal. Please, Hamzah, he implored. Do not leave your best friend like this. The shaken cousin, Ali Aljahmi, sought out the neurosurgeon and asked to be told straight, so that the family could prepare. “He said in 30 years he hadn't seen a brain so damaged,” he remembered. “He told me  : Start making arrangements. ” By this point, Anthony Taylor the boxer had said his hospital goodbyes and driven his dented Dodge Caravan the 20 miles back to the weathered white house he rented with his fiancée. Exhausted by it all, he fell asleep, only to awake an hour later to a text message aglow on his phone. Hamzah Aljahmi was dead. A Tribute to a Man Who ‘Was Everything' After the autopsy, a Youngstown funeral home arranged to return Hamzah Aljahmi to Michigan, retracing his interstate journey past the deadened brown of a Rust Belt December, to a funeral home in Detroit, close to the Dearborn line. A handful of relatives and friends, all men, prepared the young body for burial. They prayed as they tended to their somber task, while verses of the Quran emanated from a loudspeaker. The dead young man was laid upon a table. Fingernails and toenails were clipped. The body was meticulously cleansed and gently rubbed with a scented oil that made the skin glisten  —   “The smell was very beautiful,” the cousin Ali Aljahmi said. Then it was wrapped in three sheets of white cloth. The boxer was placed in a   coffin made of fiberboard and cardboard, in keeping with an adherence to simplicity. A pleasant perfume was sprinkled over the burial cloth. Late the next morning, a dark blue Dodge Caravan hearse carried the body the seven miles to the American Moslem Society mosque, a   building topped with a turquoise dome. Hundreds were already gathering in the parking lot. Family members shelved their shoes and carried the modest coffin up the stairs, past the small brown donation boxes and into a   area reserved for women, at the far back of the cavernous hall. The sounds of weeping escaped the divide. The coffin, draped in a    cloth, was then moved to one side of the long rectangular hall, where mourners paid their respects to many, many relatives: the extended Aljahmi tribe. The father, Ali Aljahmi, sat in the first chair, and in the second, at the family's insistence, was Mohamed Hamood  —   Coach Mo  —   Hamzah's   trainer. The mourning paused for the afternoon prayer. Long rows of men and boys, including many not before seen at the mosque, stood shoulder to shoulder on the    carpet with patterns pointing toward Mecca. They spilled into the downstairs space and out into the parking lot. After the afternoon prayer, relatives carried the coffin to the front of the room. The imam led a short funeral service that included prayers for forgiveness, for Hamzah Aljahmi, for all of humankind, and for mercy upon the family. Allahu akbar. God is great. It was time for burial. The shoeless pallbearers descended the stairs to meet the December cold and the jostle of thousands. They walked with purpose across the lot, some slipping into shoes as they went, carving a path through a human crush that was affecting traffic along Vernor Highway. Many vied to touch the coffin, while others competed for an honored turn as a pallbearer. But why so many mourners for a    man? People explain that Hamzah Aljahmi “died in action” that he represented the Yemeni embrace of boxing that he made friends with Arabs and   black, white, male, female that he embodied an infectious liveliness. “He was everything, to be honest with you,” Ibrahim Aljahim, a cousin and community leader, said. Another cousin, Fayez Algahmi, a former honorary consul of Yemen, agreed. “The way he died, and the thing he died for, touched everyone,” Algahmi said. The funeral procession turned right onto Riverside Drive, along which the rusty   fence of Woodmere Cemetery disappears into the distance. Now and then the undulations in the cemetery's brown grass revealed the   tops of tombstones. Chanting prayers as they walked, the mourners turned left at a gate to enter the cemetery, many of them forming a protective bubble around the raised coffin. The occasional cold breeze ruffled its drape of    cloth. Near the grave site, relatives opened the coffin one more time, so that the father and a few others could say their final goodbyes. “I gave him a bunch of kisses on the forehead,” his first cousin Ali Aljahmi recalled. In keeping with Islamic ritual, the body was turned on its right side to face Mecca, and some dirt was placed beside it. The coffin was closed, and lowered into its concrete rectangular case. Then mourner after mourner threw dirt three times into the hole, signifying the beginning and end of things. God is great, they whispered. To God we belong, and to him we shall return. The communal grieving did not end at the grave. For weeks afterward, streams of people came to the Aljahmi family's simple home to offer condolences and distraction. Among them were many young people seeking some token or relic of their friend the boxer, Hamzah the Lion. A  . A jacket. A shoe. A ribbon. A trophy. Of course, of course, the brokenhearted father would say. “I don't close the door,” he explained. A Fighter Finds Comfort in Someone Who Understands On the tough south side of Youngstown, in the squat   refuge called Jack Loew's South Side Boxing Club, the boxing life continues for Anthony Taylor. He and other   champions punch bags and skip rope, spar with partners and obey the sign that says “no weapon of any kind”  —   other than fists. Taylor had taken some time off after the Hamzah Aljahmi fight to get his body and mind straight. His right hand had been damaged, among other parts. True, the first time Taylor returned to the ring to spar, he froze for a moment. (“I was waiting on him, and he hit me, and hit me again,” he says. “And I was like, O. K. ”) But now the Tiger is back, shorn of his dreadlocks and preparing for his second professional fight, which is scheduled to be at the same venue, Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church. He'll be taking his chances, once again, in a bingo hall. “I can't walk in there thinking about what happened,” Taylor says, as if trying to convince himself. “You can't change what's happened in the past. I wish I could. ” As Taylor works out, his coach, Jack Loew, sits in his back office, the walls covered with boxing memorabilia, a broken speed bag on his desk. He was the promoter behind that fatal boxing event, and he has wept over Aljahmi's death. “You don't think about stuff like that,” Loew says, voice cracking. “A frigging club show with   for four rounds. ” A few loose ends from that night remain to be tied. For one thing, the Mahoning County coroner has yet to release the results of his autopsy (although the weakness in Aljahmi's right leg that night could be suggestive of a left hemispheric brain bleed). This is why Bernie Profato, the Ohio Athletic Commission's director, has not formally closed the case, although he says his own inquiry found no lapses of protocol by the commission he oversees. Profato is also haunted by the memory of this polite young man, such a model of respect at the  . But the inherent dangers are made plain in the contracts signed by boxers, including these two   pros, Taylor and Aljahmi. “You're entering a sport where you could be seriously hurt or injured,” Profato says. “They know that. That's just the nature of the sport. ” A childhood friend of Loew's comes through the boxing club's door: Ray Mancini, the onetime lightweight world champion, known in Youngstown and far beyond as Boom Boom. Unfairly, he is also known for one fight:   Kim, Las Vegas, 1982. Mancini connected with two hard rights to Kim's head at the start of the 14th round, sending the tenacious South Korean challenger to the canvas and prompting the referee to declare a technical knockout. Incurring a brain bleed known as a subdural hematoma, Kim lapsed into a coma and died four days later. He was 27. Mancini was 21. It took years, but Mancini worked his way through the depression and   that followed. Even though he eventually forgave himself and made peace with the tragedy, he says, others have shown less grace over the years. “Hey, Boom Boom,” he mimics. “Hey, man, let me ask you something. What's it like to kill somebody in the ring? I mean, what's it like to see someone go down and never get up?” Mancini is 54 now,   and fit, with various business and entertainment interests. He has come to his friend's club this evening to counsel the young boxer with whom he shares a sorrowful bond. He wants to talk about forgiveness, and loudmouths, and giving up the game if there is even the slightest hesitation in the ring. Loew heads for the door in search of his boxer Taylor, saying, “I don't even know where this kid is at. ” Soon Anthony Taylor, fresh from the stutter of speed bags and the whack of skipped rope, is in the   quiet, sitting shyly across from the Boom Boom Mancini like a confessor before a priest. “Really sad for you, man,” Mancini begins. “I never met you before, but.   …    ”",False,"PART 1 YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio     Numbered balls of chance rattle and rise two nights a week down at the cavernous community hall of Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church. It's called a good bingo when your number comes up. But that last Saturday before Christmas offered no good bingos. The night was reserved for a boxing event billed as Season's Beatings, which had prompted a newspaper deliveryman named Anthony Taylor to pull up in his clattering Dodge Caravan.   years old, 5 feet tall, 115 pounds, about to turn pro. A fist of nerves, he walked down the   stairwell to the finished basement, a space used for church dances and wedding banquets, but now an open locker room. Chandeliers glittered above the fighters trying to warm up and calm down, while the crowds upstairs cheered on the amateurs, including a      who would knock out his   opponent. Taylor had longed for this moment. All those years of being picked on because of his size, all those street fights, all that anger needing redirection toward something constructive     all down to this. He had his hair in ropy dreadlocks and his   shorts,   for $300, pulled high on his hardened torso. Portable curtains in the basement separated the hometown favorites from the    the A's from the B's. Someone smart about boxing could walk in cold and tell which side was which. The local fighters are usually a notch above, in better shape, expected to win. But Taylor's   trainer, Jack Loew, heard this hammering sound, a whap, whap,   from the curtain's other side. He peeked and saw a sinewy teenager in    shorts pounding the outstretched mitts of his trainer with uncommon discipline.  . We got a fighter, Loew said to somebody. Taylor was on his own side of the divide, warming up, when the curtain briefly parted to reveal his opponent. They made eye contact. Nothing like anger, Taylor recalled. Both nervous. Just looking at each other.  The curtain closed. A Life of Taking Punches and Unleashing His Own Five foot even.  That's how Anthony Taylor describes his height. Not a   higher or lower. Five foot even. When you're 9 inches shorter than the average man, abuse will find you. But Taylor was determined from an early age to prove his true stature the only way he knew. Street fighting, he says. His mother, an   factory worker, and his father, a handyman, split up before he was in kindergarten, so he bounced around a little. Moving from the small Ohio city of Warren to Youngstown, then down to Jackson, Tenn. he learned that broken families were tough on children, and that bullies were ubiquitous. I was always the smallest guy in the neighborhood, so I had a lot of people picking on me, Taylor said. I really didn't go around looking for trouble. It just seemed to find me because I was so small.  And I had a bad attitude, he added. One day the manager of a gym in Jackson saw this small angry kid giving as good as he got, and invited him to do something with those quick hands and quicker rage. The kid began to learn. Somebody hit you, hit you really hard, and you want to do something back, Taylor said. But when you think about it, you can't fight when you're angry. Boxing is a thinking game.  Taylor followed the amateur circuit     Florida, Alabama, Arkansas, Nevada     earning a reputation as a boxer who kept on coming. At a fight one night in Little Rock, his trainer called out, Go get him, Tiger.  The nickname stuck. He tried a semester of community college, but higher education wasn't for him, at least not yet. Sometimes the classes would run over time, and he'd be late to the gym. College could wait, he figured boxing could not. He had his career goals. To be at the top of the ladder, he said. Number one. Champion.  Missing his family back north, Taylor returned to Ohio. He lives with his fiance, Tiera Glover, their    daughter and her two sons in Warren, in a worn house with green plastic furniture planted under the porch's sagging roof. They cover the $600 monthly rent by delivering 250 copies of The Tribune Chronicle, a Warren newspaper, every morning. And every afternoon, except on days when he can't afford the gas, Taylor drives his knocking Dodge Caravan, with its car seat and little girl toys, the 20 miles to Youngstown     to Jack Loew's South Side Boxing Club, his   sanctuary, where boxing gloves hang from nails like holiday ornaments. The club stands out along a   stretch of Market Street. Some years ago, its owner, Jack Loew, hired a resident of a nearby halfway house for convicts to paint the exterior red and black. The artist also painted a pair of boxing gloves, enveloped in a wreath of stars that can convey dreamlike glory or a concussive haze. Loew is 56,   and as squat and solid as his building. He boxed as an amateur before focusing on a college football career that ended after several knee operations. He became a Teamster, lost the warehouse job he thought would last to retirement, worked construction and started his own   company. He also opened this club in 1989, as if in homage to what his hometown had once been. Youngstown was a pugnacious steel city of 167, 000 when Loew was born, with boxing clubs anchored in many neighborhoods. This is where his childhood friend Ray Mancini     Boom Boom     learned how to become a world lightweight champion. A   later, Youngstown is down to a population of 65, 000, a hemorrhaging of 100, 000 people caused by   closings, a failure to diversify and the absence, so far, of a sustainable second act. Lost in the exodus were some signature parts of the Youngstown culture, including many boxing clubs. But Loew took a shot. He opened his gym on Southern Boulevard, moved to an ancient brick building on Erie Street, then settled here, on the city's tough south side. No problems so far, save for that time someone removed a massive tractor tire from the gym and rolled it like a determined Sisyphus up and down the hilly neighborhood     only to return the tire the next day. His excuse was simple: Just wanted to see if I could do it, Coach. Two decades ago, a scrappy    kid from the south side's Slovak neighborhood came to Loew's gym looking to learn how to box. This kid, Kelly Pavlik, went on to become the Ghost, an electrifying, dominant boxer with a drinking problem. He abruptly quit in 2013, saying he feared the   medical impact of his chosen career. Kelly picked my door to come through, said Loew, who is called Coach Jack by his boxers. We were always crowded, but when we won middleweight champion of the world.        No need to finish the sentence: Pavlik's success was good for Jack Loew's South Side Boxing Club. It attracted a lot of locals looking to make their mark, including a superflyweight named Anthony Taylor. A   Joe Frazier, Loew said. This is boxing code for saying that Taylor keeps coming at you, takes a punch to give a punch, and has fists that hit like anvils. Taylor couldn't remain an amateur forever. Loew needed to find him a professional opponent, maybe for the Season's Beatings event that he had set up for the week before Christmas at the Ukrainian hall. But flyweights and bantamweights     who weigh less than half the reigning heavyweight champion, Tyson Fury     are hard to come by in this part of the country. A couple of weeks before Christmas, though, a trainer from Detroit who was bringing in two amateurs for the boxing night offered a solution. He said that he could supply a flyweight who, like Taylor, was itching to turn pro. Two Partners Engaging in a Dangerous Dance The ding of a bell in a church hall transformed two slight young men into professional fighters, hired to withstand blows to body and head while trying to pound each other out of consciousness. Their pay for the   fight: $300 for Taylor and $500 for his    opponent, since he was coming in from 200 miles away. Moments earlier they had stood with heads bowed, their coaches massaging their backs as the referee went over final details. Then they had tapped gloves, a gesture conveying   solidarity between strangers, known to each other only through a stolen glance across that parted curtain. Anthony Taylor danced the cautionary dance with his partner, head bobbing, looking for a moment to strike. He prided himself on his patience. But when the opponent tested with a tentative, catlike thrust, Taylor responded with a wild swing that punched only air, betraying his overeagerness. Then came a   scrum, left right left right. Violent contact made. The crowd aahed in approval. More than 700 people had turned out. Loew, the promoter as well as Taylor's trainer, had charged $20 for general admission and $50 for ringside, while also managing to sell more than two dozen corporate tables. But after covering expenses that included the referee, the hall and ring rentals, and the hotel rooms for    boxers, Loew would take in just $382 for his eight weeks of work. At least his choice of location and timing     a Ukrainian church hall in late December     ensured a festive touch to the boxing event. A decorated Christmas tree sparkled in the corner. A    Ukrainian flag hung over the water fountain. A Christmas wreath and bright lights hung beside signs that said, Valid Bingo Is Ball Called     Not Off Monitor and Early Bird Winner Take All.  Instead of calls of   and  though, there arose the grunts of boxers, the whacks of leather against flesh, the cries and sighs of spectators in thrall. Some of the loudest shouts came from Taylor's friends and family members. Come on, Ant'! You got this! Taylor crouched as he stalked, making his   frame even smaller before springing like a    . He connected with a left that sent his opponent back, and kept on coming. He ducked under a swing, came over the top and delivered another left that knocked the fighter in red and white down into the ropes. As Taylor retreated to his corner, fans were shouting: He's done, he's done! Stop the fight! Seconds later, Taylor struck again. His guard came down, and I hit him with a straight left hand, he recalled. A second knockdown, although this time his opponent got up quickly, adjusting his trunks as if the fall had been nothing more than a wardrobe malfunction. Then Taylor found himself reeling backward, almost comically, after taking a hard left to the head. He responded with a punch that he thought connected for a delayed knockdown others saw more of a phantom punch and stumble. Still, Loew recalled, If the ref had stopped the fight, I don't think anyone would have complained.  The bell clanged. Taylor slumped to his corner, exhausted from all that he had expended trying to end the fight. He drank some water and listened to encouraging words from Loew, who struggled to be heard over the    music pounding out of the sound system. Then, again, came the bell's beckoning. Taylor found his opponent waiting for him at the center of the ring, as if awakened by the knockdowns of the previous round. Soon there came a left that bounced Taylor off the ring's    ropes. Anthony! someone pleaded. But Taylor could not yet find the wind or strength. I threw out a lot of gas in the first round by me trying to finish him off, he said later. You're trying to hurry up and get done with the fight. And that's where the turnaround was in the second round.  Knock him out, someone in Taylor's corner shouted. Then: Get him! Get him! And: Let's go, Tiger! And: Put him down, Ant'! Taylor took quick rights to the jaw, another hard right that rocked him, then a left and a right. Gloved fists pounded his many tattoos: the R. I. P.  on his right shoulder that honors a brother shot to death (Wrong place, wrong time, he says) the    on his left shoulder that reminds him he's a jewel in the rough the dice and playing cards adorning his chest, along with the inscription: Life A Gamble.  Tension and Triumph, Confusion and Dread The bell. Another squirt of water. More of Coach Jack's encouragement, only now sounding urgent. The passing blur of a young woman holding aloft a placard announcing Round 3. The bell. And there was Taylor's opponent again, at the center of the ring, waiting. Taylor connected with a roundhouse left, but his opponent returned with a   insult to the chin. Taylor seemed   almost disengaged, as if exhaustion had displaced his purpose. Let's go, little man! someone called out. But Taylor's coach was more concrete. Breathe, breathe! Loew was shouting. You gotta push it, Anthony! Taylor did revive, holding his own until the bell. He was convinced the round was a tossup, but his coach knew otherwise. Anthony was gassed in the third round, and took an  Loew said. Now it was the fourth and last round, the final three minutes, and there again was his opponent, waiting. Taylor knew this was it     an    thing, he called it. His dreadlocks swayed as he danced and dodged, as he punched and received punches. It went this way, a study in mundane violence, for most of the first two minutes. Toe to toe. But then Taylor suddenly had his opponent near the ropes. He threw a right that either glanced off the boxer or missed him entirely. The opponent fell backward to all but sit on the apron. Trying to capitalize, Taylor threw a left. But the opponent ducked to his right and stumbled forward, head sweeping briefly against Taylor's chest, arms outstretched, looking for something to hold on to, as if the blue mat had been pulled from beneath him. He looped his left arm around Taylor's torso as he fell onto his right knee, his lower body gone limp, his black gloves down in sudden vulnerability. The referee waved his arms. Fight over! He bent down to help the opponent, who reached up with his right hand. Halfway to his feet, the boxer wobbled and fell back down. The sudden uncertainty disrupted the order in the ring. The opponent's coach had slipped through the ropes and was now trying to help his fighter, who struggled again to rise, only to sway and fall back against his coach's shins. My knee, he was saying. My knee. Loew was also in the ring, yelling to Bernie Profato, the director of the Ohio Athletic Commission, sitting at ringside, that the round hadn't ended, and you can't have people coming into the ring, and that was a knockdown.        Your kid's gotta hit him for a knockdown, Profato called back. Mere noise. The fight was over. The opponent lay on his back as some people hovered over him, including the ringside doctor     a dermatologist     now slipping on a pair of surgical gloves. Taylor, meanwhile, knew only that he had won. He raised an arm and took a few courtly bows. But a shadow of dread was settling over this decorated bingo hall masquerading as a boxing arena. A fallen man was not rising, not rising, still not rising. His eyes were closed. Medics were climbing into the ring. You knew, Loew said. You knew right then and there.  You knew right then and there. The loser, this kid from Michigan named Hamzah Aljahmi, now   was unconscious. And the winner, Anthony Taylor, now   was sobbing. PART 2 DEARBORN, Mich.     The amateur boxer slept. Huddled in the passenger seat of his family's sport utility vehicle, he rocked in slumber as his father drove out of Dearborn, then south and east around Lake Erie, verses from the Quran intoning softly from the speakers. Now and then the boxer would rouse long enough for a snatch of small talk. But soon his eyes would close again, and he would sleep through the December blur of Rust Belt towns and   fields, right to the edge of the Ohio city where he was to fight his first professional fight. Youngstown. This was Hamzah Aljahmi, 19, the oldest child and best friend of the man behind the wheel, Ali Aljahmi. The   permit dangling from the rearview mirror hinted of the father's   worries, but no matter how bad things got, he knew that he could always confide in this beautiful   beside him, sleeping now to the   rhythms. How could he deny his son's passionate dream to box his way to fame and fortune? To become the pride of Dearborn? Of Yemeni people everywhere? This was Hamzah's destiny: to make his professional debut at a Christmastime boxing event called Season's Beatings. Hamzah's father had followed a different path. Born in Yemen, he had immigrated to Brooklyn, left high school without graduating     joked around too much, he says     and begun a life of manual labor. Store work. Factory work. Lifting and moving. He gravitated to Dearborn, the world headquarters of the Ford Motor Company, where   of the nearly 100, 000 residents are  : Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi, Palestinian, Yemeni. Here are the Henry Ford museum and the Arab American National Museum, plants that make the   truck and restaurants that make fahsa, a seasoned lamb stew that is shared with others and scooped with torn pieces of flatbread. Now Ali Aljahmi was the married father of five, disabled by a   injury and living in a   neighborhood, a block from a massive factory. But he was an Aljahmi, a member of a fiercely proud extended Yemeni family with deep roots in two cultures. The Aljahmis, the Eljahmis, the Algahmis, the Aljahims     all there for him, and he for them. Above all, he was there for Hamzah, his elder son, the boxer. Years earlier, when the family was living in Detroit, three kids ganged up on skinny young Hamzah Aljahmi. The boy held his own in the mismatch, prompting an onlooker to give grudging respect: Your son is one tough character. Sensing a purpose in life, Hamzah began training with one of his idols, Brian Mihtar, a prominent   middleweight boxer known as Brian the Lion, who compiled a   record, with 10 knockouts, before suspending his career in 2010. He took a liking to this fledgling boxer, who showed both talent and heart. Like a brother, Mihtar said. When Mihtar closed his gym, Aljahmi and his father searched the Detroit area for someone who could make the boy   someday. They eventually chose Mohamed Hamood, or Coach Mo, a muscular former Marine with a shaved head who builds houses to support his family and his boxing fix. The amateur's determination and focus impressed Hamood. The boy had phenomenal hand speed, an ability to slip punches, and surprising pop for a flyweight. But his tendency to fight with his chin up often left him dangerously exposed it was almost as if he were daring to be hit. Still, Hamood said, a very hard worker     very hard.  Hamzah Aljahmi fought more than a score of amateur matches, winning most and learning from all. Turning pro became his obsession, his father said: All the time, his mind go to the boxing.  He admired the ferocious boxers of Yemeni blood. Sadam Ali, the tough welterweight from Brooklyn. Mohamed Adam, the young superfeatherweight from Dearborn. His former coach, the Lion, Brian Mihtar. And, of course, Prince Naseem, whose image even served for a while as the wallpaper on Aljahmi's smartphone. True, the young man had other interests. He attended prayer services. Doted on his mother and younger siblings. Abided high school, barely. Kept girls at a safe but friendly distance. Worked at a Tim Horton's doughnut shop and then at the American Coney Island restaurant, serving hot dogs smothered in chili and onions. But it was boxing that defined him. He craved cranberry juice, shunned bread and spent most of his spare time in Hamood's gym, in Dearborn Heights, working out, sparring with heavier partners, itching to fight for a living. He was bugging me to go pro when he was 17, Hamood, 55, recalled. And I'd say, Let's take our time.'  Some friends and relatives approached the inherent violence of Aljahmi's passion delicately, occasionally suggesting that he give up the ring. Others accepted that he knew who he was, and admired him for it. He talked of becoming champion and parlaying his   fame in a way that would help others in need     in   Yemen and beyond. Remember when he helped to collect clothes for Syrian refugees? And somehow persuaded his father to donate his three favorite coats? Remember that saying he used to repeat? You laugh at me because I'm different I laugh at you because you're all the same.  Mohammad Yacoubi, 19, a classmate of Aljahmi's and one of his closest friends, shrugged in mock surrender while trying to explain the young man's charms. He had no enemies, he was respectful to his mother and father, he loved his siblings, and he was loyal to his friends. Just a special kid, Yacoubi said. Opportunity came in early December, when Coach Mo Hamood struck a deal to have Aljahmi fight in Youngstown against another amateur who was also turning pro. He was ready, Hamood said of his young flyweight. Aljahmi girded for the day. After telling his father that a door had opened, he posted a photograph on Instagram of his application for a Michigan boxing license, along with a note sharing the date of his debut fight     DECEMBER 19th     and asking people to come support him. Alhamdulillah.  Praise be to God. Making Final Preparations and Planning to Celebrate As the S. U. V. approached the outskirts of Youngstown, some three hours after leaving Dearborn, Hamzah Aljahmi stirred into consciousness. Looking around, he said that it was his turn to drive. His father laughed but surrendered the wheel. Father and son headed to the prefight   at a government building in downtown Youngstown. The younger Aljahmi's     manner impressed the director of the Ohio Athletic Commission, a retired police officer and former referee named Bernie Profato     so much so that Profato told him, win or lose, You'll be welcome back in Ohio anytime.  After the   Aljahmi joined his coach and the two amateurs from Dearborn, including an    with a preternatural punching ability, for some   at a Carrabba's Italian restaurant, not far from their rooms at the Red Roof Inn. Aljahmi had pasta with cream sauce. Before the night was over, the eager boxer posted one last photograph of himself on Instagram. Big smile. Throwing a right fist at the camera. Ready for 2mrw fight night everyone keep me in ur prayers inshallah, he wrote. If Allah wills it. The next morning, Aljahmi and his father ate breakfast at an IHOP     eggs and turkey sausage for more weight gain     then returned to the hotel for a short rest and the long wait. Since the next day would be the father's 51st birthday, the two Aljahmis talked about getting a cake. Win and we'll celebrate twice, the father promised. With the time drawing near, they drove with Coach Mo and his two young amateurs to the    community hall of Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church, on Youngstown's west side. Joining them were four friends who had driven from Dearborn in a cramped   Toyota. Down in the hall's chandeliered basement, where curtains separated boxers from the opponents they were about to meet, young Aljahmi chatted away as his coach prepared him for his debut. While Aljahmi sat with his arms propped on a white towel draped over a chair back, Coach Mo wrapped his boxer's hands in protective gauze, carefully, almost clinically. He then slipped   gloves over those hands and tied the strings. Finally, to cut down on the rudeness of leather against skin, he applied petroleum jelly with his fingertips to the unlined brow, the fresh cheeks, and the chin too often left exposed in the rashness of youth. There was one last detail. With his first professional fight just moments away, Aljahmi still had no nickname. But if his opponent     a short fighter he had seen when the curtain between them suddenly opened     was calling himself the Tiger, then how about something just as feral? How about the Lion? Agreed. A protective entourage     his father, his coach, a few friends     escorted Aljahmi up the basement steps and into the   auditorium, a   bingo hall set up for a boxing event. Now here he was, for the night's first professional fight, a   in the superflyweight division. In    shorts with matching red shoes, the dynamo from Dearborn. The pride of the   community. His father's best friend. Hamzah the Lion Aljahmi. A Sudden Shift in Mood After the Opening Bell Before the first bell, Aljahmi had told Coach Mo that this was his time. I'm ready, Coach, he had said. Let's get this thing going. Now it was going, but not well. Aljahmi's opponent was quick, active, and crouched so small that he made for a difficult target. The sight of their Hamzah being pummeled startled his friends, who had been harboring a more abstract understanding of what it meant to box professionally. Then down Aljahmi went, tagged by a powerful left. His opponent had capitalized on the weakness that Coach Mo had been working on: the boxing  he called it, of leaving the chin exposed. It felt like a movie when he went down, Aljahmi's friend Mohammad Yacoubi said. He had gone into that ring like a superhero.  A few seconds later, Aljahmi went down a second time, forcing Coach Mo to make quick assessments. His young boxer was more wobbly after the first knockdown, the coach later said, after taking a punch that was right on the button.  But the second one? He had a little wobble, he said. But he can go.  Aljahmi did bounce up quickly. He adjusted his trunks     as if recalibrating body and mind     and went back to work. Becoming more aggressive, he delivered a hard left that had his opponent backpedaling. Then, while trying to avoid a swing that seemed to hit more air than flesh, Aljahmi fell against the ropes. He might have simply tripped, but it was not an impressive way to end the first round. Two knockdowns and one stumble. He returned to his corner charged with energy. What did I do wrong, Coach? Hamzah, your chin is way up in the air, Hamood recalled saying. And your right hand is down.  Aljahmi went out to own the second round, exploiting his opponent's fatigue and blocking out the shouts of a Youngstown crowd eager to see this    fall. When the bell rang, he all but ran back to his corner after leaving his weary opponent on the ropes. Great job, Coach Mo told Aljahmi. Let's keep doing what you're doing. Use your jab. No need to wrestle with him.  Aljahmi looked at his clutch of friends in the seats, smiled, nodded his head     and returned to the ring to follow his coach's instructions exactly. Round 3 repeated Round 2. Although his opponent tagged him quickly with a left from nowhere, Aljahmi answered with a hard right to the chin. There he goes! Yacoubi, Aljahmi's friend, shouted. Soon another Aljahmi right found purchase. There you go! There you go! He's tired! He's tired! Hamzah, he's tired! This was true. Aljahmi's opponent was still recovering from having fought so aggressively in the first round. His own coach was shouting for him to push through it     which he did, briefly, during a   flurry. The bell rang just as Aljahmi uncorked one more punch. A little late, it seemed, but clearly accidental. He tapped his opponent's chest in apology. Coach Mo gave Aljahmi water and applied more petroleum jelly, that translucent touch of protection, to his eyebrows, cheeks and nose. We need this round, the coach said, as if to make clear to his boxer the tossup closeness of the fight. I got you, Coach. Aljahmi then leaned over, found his father in the crowd, and shook his right glove in a gesture that seemed to say now is the time. Now. He was so jacked up on adrenaline that he hurried to the center of the ring well before the bell. The   referee had to nudge him back a step or two, while his coach called after him that he was the toughest kid he knew. Go get him, Coach Mo commanded. The two superflyweights gave it their all, each determined not to lose his professional debut, as the crowd urged them on. Give him one, Hamzah! Aljahmi's friends shouted. There you go! More! More! Get him, get him, get him! Hamzah, get him! Hamzah, he's done! He's done! Keep going! Then     a punch to their friend's head. Oooh! Aljahmi, who had been dominating, was suddenly backed into a corner by his flailing opponent. Get out of the corner! a friend yelled. Get out of the corner! Too late. Their superhero was squat against the apron, dodging swings, lurching forward, grasping to hold on to something unseen, then falling, drooping, legs not cooperating, arms down. The referee stopped the fight, causing confusion about what had just happened. He tried to help Aljahmi to his feet, but the boxer could not find the strength. Panicking, Coach Mo rushed into the ring. Good job, Hamzah! he said, mistakenly thinking the bell had rung. Get up. You won the fight! I can't. My knee. I twisted my knee. He leaned back, or maybe fell back, onto Coach Mo's shins. Aljahmi's father and friends had just been shouting that his opponent was done now they were mute. A moment ago their Hamzah had been controlling the fight now he was propped against his coach's legs like a rag doll. A dermatologist serving as the ringside doctor slipped under the ropes and donned surgical gloves. The Lion lay flat on the mat. Then, Coach Mo said, Hamzah closed his eyes.  PART 3 YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio     The fearless young boxer feared what he would see, feared how he would be received. He lingered at the threshold of the surgical intensive care unit, unable to take those few short steps to the bedside of his comatose opponent. The boxer, Anthony Taylor, known for his        ferocity, froze under the unforgiving lights of crisis care at St. Elizabeth Youngstown Hospital, where a chorus of beeping monitors and exhaling respirators sang of lives at the precipice. He did not want to be here. That is, he wanted to be here, and his coach told him that he should be here, but he was frightened. In his gloveless hands he carried the shield of a bouquet, bright yellow flowers that were like dandelions, only nicer. A nurse asked if he needed help. Soon, a relative of the patient he had come to see invited him into a crowded room. There, in a small bed, with a white bandage wrapped around his head and a blue air tube running from his mouth, was the man Taylor had recently danced and fought with: Hamzah Aljahmi, 19, his eyes still closed. Taylor handed the flowers to someone and sat in a chair near the foot of the bed, stunned. To think that less than 72 hours earlier, he and this person had each been paid a few hundred dollars to fight their first professional fight, a   in the hall of a Ukrainian church. To think how they had stared into each other's eyes while engaged in a most violent form of intimacy. It could be    Anthony Taylor in that bed, not Hamzah Aljahmi. Now Anthony would be spending the holidays with his family, while Hamzah.        The visitor began to cry. Ali Aljahmi, a first cousin, was moved, even impressed, by the sight of this distraught stranger paying his respects. For you to step into this room of anger and grief, Aljahmi thought to himself. For you to come to be with us. Takes a lot of strength. The cousin led Taylor into the hall to offer comforting perspective. Whatever was happening in that hospital room was Allah's will, he said, and do not doubt that you helped Hamzah to realize his dream of becoming a professional boxer. One more thing, Aljahmi said. You have become family with me forever for this kind of gesture.  Taylor returned to the room and, for the next hour, talked with the father, an uncle and a few cousins of the man laid out before them, the black of his eyebrows enhanced by an enveloping whiteness of bandages and blankets. They told me they wanted me to keep going, Taylor recalled. That he would want me to keep going, and that I have to honor him and keep him alive by continuing to box.  The father, also named Ali Aljahmi, would only vaguely remember Taylor's visit, so   were his waves of grief. He had been at the fight. He had seen his beloved son, a determined fighter, crumple to the blue mat. Not in direct response to any punch, it seemed, but almost as an afterthought. The elder Aljahmi had been here in this chilling, antiseptic environment ever since, save for when nurses would gently tell him it was time to leave for the night. He'd return to a hotel whose name he would not remember and try to avoid the many anxious telephone calls from family members and friends back in their hometown of Dearborn. How is Hamzah? How is Hamzah? How is Hamzah? The father did not want to answer. If he did respond, it was to tell a version of the truth: Hamzah is sleeping.  Finally, the father telephoned a nephew in Dearborn with the same name as his: Ali Aljahmi, Hamzah's cousin. I need you to bring Hamzah's mother here to Youngstown, Ali. She needs to see him. The nephew understood what his uncle was not saying. He did as he was told. He packed Hamzah's mother, Jamilah Aljahmi, and other relatives into a borrowed Chevy Cruze and began to drive, listening to them cry because Hamzah had been injured, but knowing that worse news awaited them in Youngstown. The mother saw her child wrapped in white, as if already prepared for the coffin. She held his feet, felt warmth, and in her profound grief exclaimed that he was alive! All this was too much for her health, it was decided. A relative drove Hamzah's mother and the other women back to Dearborn. To wait for what was to be. But the father clung to hope as his son had clung to the ropes. He arose one morning in that strange hotel feeling as though all would be well. These efficient people in lab coats and nursing outfits would find some   equivalent of smelling salts, and his son's eyes would open. Finally, though, the father let go. Shedding his stoicism, he collapsed onto his son's chest and begged between sobs that Hamzah rise and come with him to IHOP for another restorative meal. Please, Hamzah, he implored. Do not leave your best friend like this. The shaken cousin, Ali Aljahmi, sought out the neurosurgeon and asked to be told straight, so that the family could prepare. He said in 30 years he hadn't seen a brain so damaged, he remembered. He told me  : Start making arrangements.  By this point, Anthony Taylor the boxer had said his hospital goodbyes and driven his dented Dodge Caravan the 20 miles back to the weathered white house he rented with his fiance. Exhausted by it all, he fell asleep, only to awake an hour later to a text message aglow on his phone. Hamzah Aljahmi was dead. A Tribute to a Man Who Was Everything' After the autopsy, a Youngstown funeral home arranged to return Hamzah Aljahmi to Michigan, retracing his interstate journey past the deadened brown of a Rust Belt December, to a funeral home in Detroit, close to the Dearborn line. A handful of relatives and friends, all men, prepared the young body for burial. They prayed as they tended to their somber task, while verses of the Quran emanated from a loudspeaker. The dead young man was laid upon a table. Fingernails and toenails were clipped. The body was meticulously cleansed and gently rubbed with a scented oil that made the skin glisten     The smell was very beautiful, the cousin Ali Aljahmi said. Then it was wrapped in three sheets of white cloth. The boxer was placed in a   coffin made of fiberboard and cardboard, in keeping with an adherence to simplicity. A pleasant perfume was sprinkled over the burial cloth. Late the next morning, a dark blue Dodge Caravan hearse carried the body the seven miles to the American Moslem Society mosque, a   building topped with a turquoise dome. Hundreds were already gathering in the parking lot. Family members shelved their shoes and carried the modest coffin up the stairs, past the small brown donation boxes and into a   area reserved for women, at the far back of the cavernous hall. The sounds of weeping escaped the divide. The coffin, draped in a    cloth, was then moved to one side of the long rectangular hall, where mourners paid their respects to many, many relatives: the extended Aljahmi tribe. The father, Ali Aljahmi, sat in the first chair, and in the second, at the family's insistence, was Mohamed Hamood     Coach Mo     Hamzah's   trainer. The mourning paused for the afternoon prayer. Long rows of men and boys, including many not before seen at the mosque, stood shoulder to shoulder on the    carpet with patterns pointing toward Mecca. They spilled into the downstairs space and out into the parking lot. After the afternoon prayer, relatives carried the coffin to the front of the room. The imam led a short funeral service that included prayers for forgiveness, for Hamzah Aljahmi, for all of humankind, and for mercy upon the family. Allahu akbar. God is great. It was time for burial. The shoeless pallbearers descended the stairs to meet the December cold and the jostle of thousands. They walked with purpose across the lot, some slipping into shoes as they went, carving a path through a human crush that was affecting traffic along Vernor Highway. Many vied to touch the coffin, while others competed for an honored turn as a pallbearer. But why so many mourners for a    man? People explain that Hamzah Aljahmi died in action that he represented the Yemeni embrace of boxing that he made friends with Arabs and   black, white, male, female that he embodied an infectious liveliness. He was everything, to be honest with you, Ibrahim Aljahim, a cousin and community leader, said. Another cousin, Fayez Algahmi, a former honorary consul of Yemen, agreed. The way he died, and the thing he died for, touched everyone, Algahmi said. The funeral procession turned right onto Riverside Drive, along which the rusty   fence of Woodmere Cemetery disappears into the distance. Now and then the undulations in the cemetery's brown grass revealed the   tops of tombstones. Chanting prayers as they walked, the mourners turned left at a gate to enter the cemetery, many of them forming a protective bubble around the raised coffin. The occasional cold breeze ruffled its drape of    cloth. Near the grave site, relatives opened the coffin one more time, so that the father and a few others could say their final goodbyes. I gave him a bunch of kisses on the forehead, his first cousin Ali Aljahmi recalled. In keeping with Islamic ritual, the body was turned on its right side to face Mecca, and some dirt was placed beside it. The coffin was closed, and lowered into its concrete rectangular case. Then mourner after mourner threw dirt three times into the hole, signifying the beginning and end of things. God is great, they whispered. To God we belong, and to him we shall return. The communal grieving did not end at the grave. For weeks afterward, streams of people came to the Aljahmi family's simple home to offer condolences and distraction. Among them were many young people seeking some token or relic of their friend the boxer, Hamzah the Lion. A  . A jacket. A shoe. A ribbon. A trophy. Of course, of course, the brokenhearted father would say. I don't close the door, he explained. A Fighter Finds Comfort in Someone Who Understands On the tough south side of Youngstown, in the squat   refuge called Jack Loew's South Side Boxing Club, the boxing life continues for Anthony Taylor. He and other   champions punch bags and skip rope, spar with partners and obey the sign that says no weapon of any kind     other than fists. Taylor had taken some time off after the Hamzah Aljahmi fight to get his body and mind straight. His right hand had been damaged, among other parts. True, the first time Taylor returned to the ring to spar, he froze for a moment. (I was waiting on him, and he hit me, and hit me again, he says. And I was like, O. K. ) But now the Tiger is back, shorn of his dreadlocks and preparing for his second professional fight, which is scheduled to be at the same venue, Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church. He'll be taking his chances, once again, in a bingo hall. I can't walk in there thinking about what happened, Taylor says, as if trying to convince himself. You can't change what's happened in the past. I wish I could.  As Taylor works out, his coach, Jack Loew, sits in his back office, the walls covered with boxing memorabilia, a broken speed bag on his desk. He was the promoter behind that fatal boxing event, and he has wept over Aljahmi's death. You don't think about stuff like that, Loew says, voice cracking. A frigging club show with   for four rounds.  A few loose ends from that night remain to be tied. For one thing, the Mahoning County coroner has yet to release the results of his autopsy (although the weakness in Aljahmi's right leg that night could be suggestive of a left hemispheric brain bleed). This is why Bernie Profato, the Ohio Athletic Commission's director, has not formally closed the case, although he says his own inquiry found no lapses of protocol by the commission he oversees. Profato is also haunted by the memory of this polite young man, such a model of respect at the  . But the inherent dangers are made plain in the contracts signed by boxers, including these two   pros, Taylor and Aljahmi. You're entering a sport where you could be seriously hurt or injured, Profato says. They know that. That's just the nature of the sport.  A childhood friend of Loew's comes through the boxing club's door: Ray Mancini, the onetime lightweight world champion, known in Youngstown and far beyond as Boom Boom. Unfairly, he is also known for one fight:   Kim, Las Vegas, 1982. Mancini connected with two hard rights to Kim's head at the start of the 14th round, sending the tenacious South Korean challenger to the canvas and prompting the referee to declare a technical knockout. Incurring a brain bleed known as a subdural hematoma, Kim lapsed into a coma and died four days later. He was 27. Mancini was 21. It took years, but Mancini worked his way through the depression and   that followed. Even though he eventually forgave himself and made peace with the tragedy, he says, others have shown less grace over the years. Hey, Boom Boom, he mimics. Hey, man, let me ask you something. What's it like to kill somebody in the ring? I mean, what's it like to see someone go down and never get up? Mancini is 54 now,   and fit, with various business and entertainment interests. He has come to his friend's club this evening to counsel the young boxer with whom he shares a sorrowful bond. He wants to talk about forgiveness, and loudmouths, and giving up the game if there is even the slightest hesitation in the ring. Loew heads for the door in search of his boxer Taylor, saying, I don't even know where this kid is at.  Soon Anthony Taylor, fresh from the stutter of speed bags and the whack of skipped rope, is in the   quiet, sitting shyly across from the Boom Boom Mancini like a confessor before a priest. Really sad for you, man, Mancini begins. I never met you before, but.       "

And so on Saturday afternoon, at a house in a BatonRouge subdivision that had been flooded a week earlier, Mr. McKinney passed his knowledge on to a group of volunteers from lowernine. org, a nonprofit organization founded after Hurricane Katrina: cut the drywall here, this high up, and pull out the insulation like this. “Because I've been through it,” he said, “I know the dos and don'ts. ” There are plenty here in south Louisiana who have been forced to learn this kind of thing, and plenty who have learned much larger lessons as well. Those lessons include how to get money most efficiently from the federal government and ways to avoid leaving thousands of people for years in temporary shelters, like the notorious Federal Emergency Management Agency trailers, as the rebuilding proceeds. The big thoughts and small details constitute a grimly earned expertise here and particularly in New Orleans, which sits just 75 miles down the road. It is a   that will now be drawn on considerably, with   devastation across 20 parishes, at least 60, 600 homes damaged or ruined, and the long and often exasperating road to recovery just now beginning. “The silver lining, if there is any silver lining, is that this sits in a large region that has a lot of experience with rebuilding and recovery,” said Mary L. Landrieu, a former USA senator from Louisiana, and a veteran of funding fights during the hurricane recovery. “They don't have to go far to find experts. ” Many organizations that came into existence to tackle problems after Hurricane Katrina are now on the front lines of this recovery, which Obama will survey during a visit on Tuesday. The Louisiana Civil Justice Center, started in the months after the hurricane to respond to the many and confounding legal issues of the poor, is the official statewide legal aid resource in the state bar association's disaster plan. The St. Bernard Project, a nonprofit rebuilding group which now calls itself SBP and was started by two volunteers in 2006 in a parking lot in a wrecked parish outside of New Orleans, is planning to open at least one office, if not several, in BatonRouge. The group's leaders have been in talks with advertising firms in New Orleans about campaigns to educate people about how to navigate the FEMA process for grants and loans, how to avoid being defrauded by contractors and how to do some   work without any outside help at all. All are things that the group learned after Hurricane Katrina and in subsequent relief efforts elsewhere around the country. “The fact is, disaster recovery hasn't worked well in America, ever,” said Zack Rosenburg, one of the founders of the group, which has done rebuilding work after floods in South Carolina and West Virginia. “It's an extraordinarily challenging process. ” On Saturday, some of the original members of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, the state agency set up to oversee the rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina, met with local and state officials at the offices of the BatonRouge Area Foundation, a civic group, to talk about the lessons of the last 11 years. With homes in Louisiana still underwater, the talk was preliminary, said John Spain, the executive vice president of the foundation. But there was plenty to look back at and see as experiences not to repeat. “We're 11 years after Katrina, and only 60 percent of the housing stock in St. Bernard Parish is back,” Mr. Spain said, referring to a parish just east of New Orleans that was almost entirely destroyed by the levee failures after the hurricane. This time, it was Livingston Parish, just east of BatonRouge, that was almost entirely flooded. “It's important that we don't repeat mistakes whether it's from Sandy or Katrina or Gustav. ” Part of the issue then was how long it took for homes to be rebuilt and essential services to come back. After Hurricane Katrina, thousands endured extended stays in FEMA trailers, and thousands of others eventually settled down permanently in cities elsewhere, bleeding New Orleans of its population. In this flood response, several officials said, FEMA is pursuing a strategy of getting people to move back as quickly as possible into at least one or two rooms of their   houses, an aim that would depend on quick payments and a work force of volunteers. “Our efforts to help the schools get back open and get as many people back in their home as soon as possible is going to minimize the effect we had after Katrina,” said Lt. Gov Billy Nungesser, a Republican, who praised the federal response. “Right after Katrina, we didn't see that passion to really help,” he said. Still, there is plenty that has not been learned, or learned but not fixed. A report released last year by Save the Children, an advocacy group, found that few of the recommendations of a federal commission on children and disasters, which was set up after Hurricane Katrina, have been carried out nationally. And those who have worked with poor and   families since Hurricane Katrina expect to see many of the exact same problems they saw over the last decade, even if they now feel more savvy about fighting them. “The kinds of things you're going to see early on are things like people facing a potential eviction because housing is scarce,” said Laura Tuggle, the executive director of the Southeast Louisiana Legal Services, which helped the poor after Hurricane Katrina. She ticked off some more of what she expected: sudden sharp rises in rent, withheld deposits, increases in domestic violence for those stuck in close quarters and, for homeowners, complicated title problems that could jeopardize access to assistance. All of these are matters that lawyers with her group had to tackle after Hurricane Katrina. She has already gotten calls about some of them this time. “You know what needs to be done,” Ms. Tuggle said, recalling the months during which she was unable to get back to her home in New Orleans in 2005. “Because we've been there. ” Betty Michelli, 63, of BatonRouge, has now been there, though she had never been there before. On Saturday, volunteers with the St. Bernard Project were gutting her house and piling debris out on the front lawn. She and her husband stood in the hot garage, going over all that they do not know about disasters, from how FEMA is supposed to contact them, to how one gets loans from the Small Business Administration, to what exactly they are going to be doing next. “I don't know,” she said. “I just sit down and cry. ”",False,"BatonRouge, La.

19,5811,23872,Trump Tries a Jarring New Style: Diplomatic - The NY Times,NY Times,Michael Barbaro,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"He did not mock. He did not scold. He did not blunder. Instead when Donald J. Trump showed up for a hastily assembled statelike visit at the presidential palace in Mexico City on Wednesday, he managed to accomplish something that he had failed to do throughout the campaign: communicate his provocative political ideas with something resembling diplomacy. Standing beneath a Mexican flag, Mr. Trump lamented the crimes committed by immigrants, but without his usually harsh, insulting and alarmist language. He described undocumented Mexican immigrants, but not in the ugly, racially charged ways he has in the past. And he talked about building a wall on America's southern border, but in newly measured, less belligerent terms. “We recognize and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier,” he said, before adding, almost sheepishly, “a wall. ” It was Trumpism in an unfamiliar but somehow still recognizable form: shorn of its most offensive elements but faithful to its essential message. In many ways, it was Mr. Trump's most successful performance of the summer, after weeks of agonizing gaffes, missed opportunities and flagging poll numbers. Of course, as with so much surrounding Mr. Trump, the day was immediately dogged by questions of candor. Mexico's president, Enrique Peña Nieto, claimed that in their meeting he had told Mr. Trump his country would never pay for the wall, while Mr. Trump declared that the two men had never touched on who would shoulder the cost of its construction. It was not clear whether the discrepancy was the result of the language barrier or Mr. Trump's tendency to spin the facts in his favor. Still, by the end of Mr. Trump's   news conference beside Mr. Peña Nieto, it was clear that despite his struggling campaign, the Republican nominee retains a showman's instincts. Breaking protocol, Mr. Trump, a guest in the home of a foreign president, called on reporters himself, seemingly ignoring the head of state standing a few feet to his right. “Say it!” Mr. Trump declared as he pointed at reporters he knew from the USA. “Yes?” he called to another journalist. When an ABC reporter asked both men about the hurtful words that Mr. Trump had used in the past to describe Mexico, the candidate did not bother to wait for the president to speak first. It might have been Mexican soil, but the stage was still Mr. Trump's. “We'll, I'll start,” he said. He leaned in and offered his reply. Still, at times, especially during the starch exchange of formal statements, Mr. Trump seemed out of his element. As Mr. Peña Nieto spoke at length, Mr. Trump appeared uncomfortable and almost sullen, swiveling slightly side to side, crossing his arms and looking down, rather than at the president. He seemed incapable of maintaining the polite expression of interest that is customary for such occasions. Mr. Trump occasionally nodded as his translator whispered in his ear as Mr. Peña Nieto delivered his prepared remarks in Spanish. (Mr. Trump does not speak Spanish.) The tableau itself was startling: Mr. Trump, who has mercilessly maligned Mexico, standing inside the Mexican's president's home surrounded by the pomp and ceremony of a formal summit meeting. The grand house sits amid open fields, trees, foliage and a large complex of buildings that drown out noise from the surrounding city. An air of improbability hovered over Mr. Trump's entire trip to Mexico. Much of the country was astonished that the NY   developer had pounced on a seemingly perfunctory invitation from its president. “I think it's unlikely that the Mexican government really expected Trump to take them up on this invitation,” said Christopher Wilson, the deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. But take up the invitation Mr. Trump did. It is the kind of dramatic,   development and plot twist that Mr. Trump relishes. It was Mr. Trump, after all, who theatrically boycotted an all but mandatory Republican presidential debate in Iowa in January, commandeering an auditorium a few blocks away to put on a   show taunting his rivals. “Where's Trump?” he asked, mischievously imitating the rest of the Republican presidential field across town. Despite predictions that his absence would prove disastrous, he finished second in the state's caucuses and continued to roll up big victories. In the hours before Mr. Trump landed in Mexico, there were similar predictions of doom. And with reason. This was the same man who, after Britain voted to leave the EU, bragged on his golf course in Scotland that the rupture would be good for business there. In Mexico, his rougher edges seemed sanded down as he offered flattery and solicitousness in place of crudeness and brickbats. The   he knew, he said, “were beyond reproach. ” He described generations of their   families as “amazing people. ” Even as Mr. Peña Nieto seemed to subtly criticize him  —   by reminding Mr. Trump that illegal immigration had fallen significantly over the past decade and vigorously defending the North American Free Trade Agreement  —   Mr. Trump suppressed any urge to trade fire. Instead, he looked over at the president of a country he has denounced for over a year and told him what an honor it was to meet him. “I call you a friend,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Peña Nieto.",False,"He did not mock.

20,5815,23877,"Scheduled Flights to Cuba From U.S. Begin Again, Now With Jet Engines - The NY Times",NY Times,Frances Robles,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  —   Amid live Cuban music, fresh guava pastries and a water cannon salute, the first scheduled passenger jet service in history between Cuba and the USA began on Wednesday with a 9:45 flight from here to Santa Clara, east of Havana. The flight on JetBlue, the first regularly scheduled flight from the USA to Cuba in more than 50 years, was another important step toward normalized relations between two former Cold War foes, which promises to sharply reduce airfares and ease travel between the nations. It had been so long since an airline in the USA flew a regularly scheduled flight to the island that the last time it happened, the passengers flew on a propeller plane. Erik Díaz Oliva, 41, choked back tears as he described the significance of flying on the first scheduled flight to his home country after eight years away. “I got here at 5 a. m. and was the first to check in everyone started to cheer!” Mr. Díaz said. “To the people who say these flights don't help: Yes, it does help. It opens Cuba to the world. ” The scheduled air service was the latest in a string of important changes between the nations since Obama decided in 2014 to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba. Embassies were opened, direct mail service was restored and Carnival Cruise Line ships have sailed to Cuba. Other moves, like ferry service and the building in Cuba of an American company's tractor assembly plant, were authorized by the Obama administration, but were stalled by the Cuban government. “Today opens the door to further exchange between the American people and the Cuban people,” Anthony Foxx, the USA transportation secretary, said in an interview. “We think that's ultimately good for the expansion of freedom and democracy. ” Mr. Foxx was among the inaugural flight's 150 passengers, which included more than two dozen journalists and assorted dignitaries. “This is a novelty for me, to be able to fly direct without having to travel to a third country,” said Orestes García Vásquez, 68, who was traveling from Villa Clara to South Florida. “This allows me to save time and money. ” Cuba and the USA agreed to allow up to 90 daily   flights between the two nations, the Department of Transportation said. Six airlines have been approved for flights to nine Cuban cities other than Havana, but not all of them have announced their schedules. Mr. Foxx said far more airlines had expressed interest in flying to Havana, the capital, than could be accommodated. “I haven't seen anything like it,” he said. On Wednesday, the Department of Transportation announced that Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines and United Airlines would operate the coveted Havana flights. The airlines will fly from Atlanta Charlotte, N. C. Fort Lauderdale Houston Los Angeles Miami Newark NY Orlando, Fla. and Tampa, Fla. Calling it “good pressure,” Mr. Foxx acknowledged that Cuba would have to improve its airport infrastructure to be able to handle the increased flow of airlines. The country is notorious for poor airport facilities, and passengers often endure hourslong waits because baggage carousels or staircases needed to disembark are tied up. José Ramón Cabañas Rodríguez, Cuba's ambassador to the USA, said the country's 10 international airports were safe and secure and had fielded nearly 5, 000 charter flights from the USA last year. He added that the flight on Wednesday was yet another first for the two countries announced in the past few months. “We hope that in the near future, all remaining obstacles that limit further exchange between the two countries will be removed,” he said, referring to the American trade embargo, which remains in place. For passengers, the difference will be immense. Until now, people flying to Cuba had to book charter flights, which meant passengers had to arrive at the airport four hours before takeoff and were charged steep fees for luggage. Prices were high, lines were long and flights were often hours late. The document review process was   and passengers stood in separate lines to check in, check bags, have bags weighed and pay for the checked luggage. “The last time I went to Cuba, I paid $300 or $400 just for the luggage  —   absurd!” said Yosleidys Rodríguez, 39, who left Cuba less than two years ago for South Florida. “This is the best thing that could have happened. ” Now customers who qualify under the 12 authorized categories approved for travel can book flights directly on an airline's website, and many have paid fares as low as $99 each way. JetBlue expects to have up to seven daily flights to Cuba, although most of them will go to cities other than Havana, like Holguín and Camagüey. They are set to begin in the fall. Silver Airways, a commuter airline, on Thursday will begin offering three weekly flights to Santa Clara, and later this year will start flights to Cienfuegos, Santiago de Cuba, Cayo Coco, Varadero, Cayo Largo and Manzanillo. American Airlines begins service on Sept. 7 to Cienfuegos and Holguín, and will expand to three more Cuban cities later in the year. Although the number of Americans flying to Cuba has been steadily increasing, experts say it is unlikely that the market will be able to bear such an abundance of seats. “There's going to be a lot of seats on the market,” said Michael Zuccato of Cuba Travel Services, a charter company whose business is in peril now that consumers can book directly with airlines. “I do not believe the flights are going to be full. ” Marty St. George, the executive vice president of JetBlue, said the airline expected brisk business, particularly among Cubans visiting their families. “We do think it's an important part of history,” Mr. St. George said. “From a challenge perspective, we know the drill. Cuba has some unique elements because of 50 years of history between the U. S. and Cuba, but we're ready to go. ”",False,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

JetBlue expects to have up to seven daily flights to Cuba, although most of them will go to cities other than Havana, like Holgun and Camagey. They are set to begin in the fall. Silver Airways, a commuter airline, on Thursday will begin offering three weekly flights to Santa Clara, and later this year will start flights to Cienfuegos, Santiago de Cuba, Cayo Coco, Varadero, Cayo Largo and Manzanillo. American Airlines begins service on Sept. 7 to Cienfuegos and Holgun, and will expand to three more Cuban cities later in the year. Although the number of Americans flying to Cuba has been steadily increasing, experts say it is unlikely that the market will be able to bear such an abundance of seats. There's going to be a lot of seats on the market, said Michael Zuccato of Cuba Travel Services, a charter company whose business is in peril now that consumers can book directly with airlines. I do not believe the flights are going to be full.  Marty St. George, the executive vice president of JetBlue, said the airline expected brisk business, particularly among Cubans visiting their families. We do think it's an important part of history, Mr. St. George said. From a challenge perspective, we know the drill. Cuba has some unique elements because of 50 years of history between the U. S. and Cuba, but we're ready to go. "
21,5816,23878,"In Afghanistan's Farm Belt, Women Lead Unions and Find New Status - The NY Times",NY Times,Mujib Mashal,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"SHIBAR, Afghanistan  —   In this lush farm belt deep in central Afghanistan, women have been the organizing force behind a new wave of small village farm unions. That seems to have brought some changes. In a reversal of tradition, husbands tend to walk after their wives, trailing a couple of steps behind with   sleeves and   faces. And critically for this impoverished region, the unions have established modest supply chains at the market in the center of Bamian Province. Over just a few years, they have introduced new vegetables to their humble dinner plates. “In the old days, only potatoes and wheat were grown here,” said Zainab Husseini, a   high school biology teacher and the   farming union leader in the village of  . “Now we introduced cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, beans and other vegetables. ” The unions, in updating   agricultural traditions, have helped ensure a more reliable and diverse food supply in an often   region. In the process, the women who run the groups are finding new status and empowerment. They are no longer greeted as the mother of Ahmad or the wife of Mahmoud, but rather “union leader Gul Bahar” or “deputy union leader Reza Gul. ” The unions have put the women of Bamian on the front line of a critical struggle: the effort to shape a sustainable Afghan economy, away from dependence on foreign aid. Agriculture must surely be a crucial part of the program if that is to happen. Close to 40 percent of the population remains below the poverty line of $1. 35 a day, Afghan officials say. According to the World Bank, more than 80 percent of the Afghan population  —   and about 90 percent of the poor  —   live in rural communities. Agriculture is therefore central not just to countering widespread malnutrition in remote areas, but also to creating sustainable jobs. Assadullah Zamir, Afghanistan's minister of agriculture, says one area that requires focus is linking farmers to local and national markets, and helping their crops compete with cheap imports by imposing tariffs on, for example, Pakistani vegetables. “The production has increased with programs and training, and the market is not enough it is not sufficient,” Mr. Zamir said. If Afghanistan can better manage its water resources and establish decent connections between farms and markets  —   a critical problem in the middle of a war where battles are fought with roadside bombs and security checkpoints  —   the agriculture sector could create two million to five million sustainable new jobs, or even double the industry's percentage of the country's gross domestic product, according to Afghan officials and economic analysts. But here in remote Bamian, the terrain itself poses a huge challenge to bringing crops to market. To get to Shibar, one must drive from the provincial capital of Bamian for about an hour, up a narrow dirt track carved along the mountains. The car slowly winds its way so high along the mountaintop that the clouds hang nearly at arm's length. Then, even more slowly, as the path descends in spiraling bends, the car splashes through sudden creeks of snow melt that run through narrow gorges. After the Taliban destroyed giant Buddha statues in 2001, Bamian Province became associated mainly with one thing: potatoes. Lots of potatoes. In 2015, Bamian produced nearly 350, 000 tons of potatoes, about 60 percent of Afghanistan's total consumption, according to the country's Ministry of Agriculture. But an overabundance of that single product became a headache for farmers in Shibar, leaving them vulnerable to trader exploitation and struggling to meet their own basic food needs for most of the year. During harvest season, the potatoes are sold wholesale at   prices: roughly $150 a ton. The farmers have no way of holding on to the potatoes for the winter months, when wholesale prices double. The approximately 500 cold storage facilities built in Bamian with the help of the Afghan government in recent years are simply not enough. (The smaller facilities hold about 15 tons, and the larger community ones about 60 tons.) That realization forced the Afghan government and its international partners a few years ago to encourage growing new crops, and women like Ms. Husseini took the lead in Shibar. About five years ago, Ms. Husseini tapped into a local women's rights group she was leading to form small farmers' unions and seek help from the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture. The ministry, which formally recognized the unions in 2013, provided sample plots where farmers could plant improved seeds and learn new techniques from visiting trainers, like using different plant spacing or drip irrigation systems. “In the old days, the potatoes were this small,” Ms. Husseini, the union leader in   said, picking up a tiny rock. “When traders would come, they would set aside half of it as not good. Now they want all of it. Each potato weighs one kilogram on average. ” There are now eight village farmers' unions in Shibar, each comprising about 30 women. In addition to improving potato production, they have turned to new vegetables and, more recently, even started fruit orchards. In her small vegetable plot, Najia, the deputy union leader in   grew lettuce, cabbage and tomatoes last year. The lettuce brought her about $70, the tomatoes about $80 and the cabbage about $40. Najia is also in charge of the unions' relations with the market in Bamian's provincial capital, supplying fresh vegetables to six shops that they have established deals with  —   a very small market, but a start. Every time other union members have crops to sell, they all bring their produce to Najia, who arranges for a vehicle to take them to the market. But getting to the market is incredibly costly: Renting a small truck to take the goods there on the bumpy, narrow road out of Shibar costs about $20  —   a large sum, considering how little the farmers currently make. The Afghan government, which often uses nongovernmental organizations as implementing partners, prioritizes the extremely poor for many of its agricultural projects. So even a small grant like giving a family a sheep or a cow, as well as teaching them ways to grow and sell their products, makes a big difference. “When we go back two years later, for example, each of them have expanded that to at least three or four sheep, or sold some of the sheep to buy a cow,” said Dr. Mariam Habib, who ran one of these   programs in Bamian. With their increased economic activity and their handle of the cash flow, women say they also notice a change in their standing in the community. “Everyone invites me to parties, and they even consult me on matters now,” one gaptoothed older woman, waving her hands, told a visiting delegation of officials recently. She could not be reached for identification afterward. But in Shibar, as they increase production and earn more, some of the female union leaders bemoan a compromise that is forced on them: The new potatoes taste different. “The new potatoes are now white in the middle and have a great market, but they don't taste the same,” said Asma, the deputy chief of one union.

23,5825,23888,The News From Trump Changed. The Main Story Was Slow to Catch Up. - The NY Times,NY Times,Liz Spayd,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"It was a   day for the team covering politics at The NY Times on Wednesday. In the late afternoon, Donald J. Trump was playing the diplomat in Mexico City with President Enrique Peña Nieto, standing alongside a state leader and vowing to treat everyone living or residing in the USA with great dignity. “So important,” Trump added. By that evening, Trump was goosing a rowdy crowd in Phoenix and ensuring that anyone who entered the USA illegally would be subject to deportation, especially the criminals among them. The problem back in The Times's newsroom was that its main news story  —   published online after Trump spoke in Phoenix  —   captured more of Mexico's demure Trump than the familiar firebrand who jetted to Arizona. For many readers, the story looked like a significant misportrayal of events. Anyone coming to the Times site around 11 p. m. over an hour after Trump's speech began, saw a story that seemed blind to the angry, aggressive rhetoric that Trump delivered to his voting base along the border. Liam Burke of San Jose, Calif. was among them. “As others have no doubt mentioned, I was surprised to see the lede to this article,” he wrote. “This description of Trump's speech seems simply false and diminishing of the extreme,   racist rhetoric he offered. As the paper of record, don't you feel you have a responsibility to accurately represent the intensity of Trump's rage and the danger he poses to American values?” I can see why Burke and others are questioning the piece. They should be. After all, it seemed not to match the Trump they just saw on TV, even though the Times story was posted after the Arizona event. Here's the top of the piece: This 11 p. m. version made no mention of Trump's invitation to have individuals join him onstage to share the names of relatives who they said were killed by illegal immigrants. Nor did it refer to Trump's line that his enforcement priorities would include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays and those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals. That doesn't sound like a stark turnaround from the old Trump. Several prominent components of the coverage, including a live chat at the top of the homepage, were being quickly updated with the Arizona Trump. But the main news story was not significantly updated until an hour later, around midnight. By then it captured the more aggressive Trump and delivered a more balanced portrayal of the day. What happened? Why did the first version seem so off and why wasn't The Times more transparent about the changes? I asked Carolyn Ryan, The Times's political editor, for an explanation. “Trump acted jarringly differently in Phoenix than he did in Mexico, and we scrambled to reflect that, without obscuring the fact that he was backing away from his policy to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants,” she said. “I think readers were eager to see the fiery language and belligerent tone in Phoenix reflected quickly in the story, especially if they had just watched his appearance, and I understand that. ” What that boils down to is: We were moving as fast as we could and the story changed on us. The flaw in hanging this simply on tight deadlines and   facts is that many other major news sites managed to hit the mark. Politico was up not long after the Times article with a piece that said Trump squashed any speculation that he might soften on immigration, “delivering a hawkish, hardline, and     border platform and vowing that on Day One of his administration, the USA would launch a mammoth deportation program and begin construction of a wall. ” The Washington Post, also posting around the same time, had updated its article to say that hours after leaving Mexico Trump returned to his aggressive tenor on immigration, yelling at the crowd in Arizona and promising to subject illegals to deportation. The Arizona Republic was up with a similar piece. Ryan maintains that The Times was on the news too. She said that there has been too much focus on this single piece. Her team, she said, primarily relies on both live discussions and concise briefings on breaking news, and indeed these features dominated the homepage Wednesday night. “We aggressively update our coverage, minute by minute, through our live chat, which highlights and analyzes political events as they unfold, and our live briefing, which tells readers what they have missed,” she said. “Both are enormously popular with readers, and they have given us a flexible platform to drive   coverage in politics. ” Worthwhile point. But I'm not sure that a rolling discussion among staff members and a briefing roundup satisfies the needs of readers landing on the Times site wanting a clear sense of a confusing story. And if all the reporters on the live chat are up on the latest developments, why can't some of that make it into the main news story? Here's my take. I see nothing nefarious or   on the part of any editors or reporters involved in the Trump piece. Everyone was scrambling with   news across time zones, many moving parts, and both print and web deadlines. But given the complications of the story  —   an unpredictable candidate, brutal deadlines  —   it seems the newsroom was not in position to deliver a strong coverage package. None of the main political writers were on the scene in Mexico City or in Arizona and Patrick Healy, writer of the lead story, drew the short straw of producing both the version for the print edition and for the web. In this instance, Healy would have greatly benefited from being relieved of writing the print story in order to concentrate on the web. That might have given him some extra time to absorb the news in Phoenix and make sense of the changing rhetoric. All of this may sound like tedious newsroom mechanics, but mistakes can have a genuine impact on The Times's reputation among readers. In a climate where sinister motives are attached to every word and headline The Times produces, looking squarely at such episodes is a step worth taking.",False,"It was a   day for the team covering politics at The NY Times on Wednesday. In the late afternoon, Donald J. Trump was playing the diplomat in Mexico City with President Enrique Pea Nieto, standing alongside a state leader and vowing to treat everyone living or residing in the USA with great dignity. So important, Trump added. By that evening, Trump was goosing a rowdy crowd in Phoenix and ensuring that anyone who entered the USA illegally would be subject to deportation, especially the criminals among them. The problem back in The Times's newsroom was that its main news story     published online after Trump spoke in Phoenix     captured more of Mexico's demure Trump than the familiar firebrand who jetted to Arizona. For many readers, the story looked like a significant misportrayal of events. Anyone coming to the Times site around 11 p. m. over an hour after Trump's speech began, saw a story that seemed blind to the angry, aggressive rhetoric that Trump delivered to his voting base along the border. Liam Burke of San Jose, Calif. was among them. As others have no doubt mentioned, I was surprised to see the lede to this article, he wrote. This description of Trump's speech seems simply false and diminishing of the extreme,   racist rhetoric he offered. As the paper of record, don't you feel you have a responsibility to accurately represent the intensity of Trump's rage and the danger he poses to American values? I can see why Burke and others are questioning the piece. They should be. After all, it seemed not to match the Trump they just saw on TV, even though the Times story was posted after the Arizona event. Here's the top of the piece: This 11 p. m. version made no mention of Trump's invitation to have individuals join him onstage to share the names of relatives who they said were killed by illegal immigrants. Nor did it refer to Trump's line that his enforcement priorities would include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays and those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals. That doesn't sound like a stark turnaround from the old Trump. Several prominent components of the coverage, including a live chat at the top of the homepage, were being quickly updated with the Arizona Trump. But the main news story was not significantly updated until an hour later, around midnight. By then it captured the more aggressive Trump and delivered a more balanced portrayal of the day. What happened? Why did the first version seem so off and why wasn't The Times more transparent about the changes? I asked Carolyn Ryan, The Times's political editor, for an explanation. Trump acted jarringly differently in Phoenix than he did in Mexico, and we scrambled to reflect that, without obscuring the fact that he was backing away from his policy to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, she said.

24,6830,25225,Dilma Rousseff Is Ousted as Brazil's President in Impeachment Vote - The NY Times,NY Times,Simon Romero,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"BRASÍLIA  —   The Senate on Wednesday impeached Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's first female president, and removed her from office for the rest of her term, the capstone of a power struggle that has consumed the nation for months and toppled one of the hemisphere's most powerful political parties. The Senate voted 61 to 20 to convict Ms. Rousseff on charges of manipulating the federal budget in an effort to conceal the nation's mounting economic problems. But the final removal of Ms. Rousseff, who was suspended in May to face trial, was much more than a judgment of guilt on any charge. It was a verdict on her leadership and the slipping fortunes of Latin America's largest country. The impeachment puts a definitive end to 13 years  of governing by the leftist Workers' Party, an era during which Brazil's economy boomed, lifting millions into the middle class and raising the country's profile on the global stage. But sweeping corruption scandals, the worst economic crisis in decades and the government's   responses to the souring national mood opened Ms. Rousseff to withering scorn, leaving her with little support to fend off a power grab by her political rivals. “She lacked it all,” said Mentor Muniz Neto, a writer from São Paulo who described Ms. Rousseff's final ouster as a “death foretold,” asserting that she lacked charisma, competence and humility. “We deserved better. ” To her many critics, the impeachment was a fitting fall for an arrogant leader at the helm of a political movement that had lost its way. But Ms. Rousseff and her supporters call her ouster a coup that undermines Brazil's young democracy. Moreover, her impeachment may not restore public confidence in Brazil's leaders, or diminish the corruption that pervades the country's politics. To the contrary, many Brazilians note, it transfers power from one   party to another. Michel Temer, 75, the interim president who served as Ms. Rousseff's vice president before breaking with her this year, is now expected to remain in office until the end of the current term in 2018. But Mr. Temer's centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, which anchored the Workers' Party's governing coalition for more than a decade, was also deeply enmeshed in the colossal graft schemes staining Brazil's political system in recent years. It arguably benefited as much as the Workers' Party from huge bribes and illicit campaign financing. Since becoming interim president in May, Mr. Temer has had approval ratings nearly as dismal as Ms. Rousseff's. Shifting the government to the right, he named a cabinet without any female or   ministers, outraging many in a country where nearly 51 percent of people define themselves as black or mixed race, according to the 2010 census. Several of the men named by Mr. Temer have already resigned under the cloud of scandal, including his anticorruption minister and his planning minister, amid claims that they were trying to stymie investigations into the bribery scandals engulfing the national oil company, Petrobras. Mr. Temer was recently found guilty of violating campaign finance limits, a conviction that could make him ineligible to run for office for eight years. Beyond that, a construction executive has testified that Mr. Temer was the beneficiary of a $300, 000 bribe, an assertion Mr. Temer disputes. The impeachment effort has divided the nation and stirred passions on both sides. Of the four Brazilian presidents elected since Brazil's democracy was   in the 1980s, Ms. Rousseff is the second to be forced from office through the impeachment process. In 1992, Fernando Collor de Mello resigned before the Senate could convict him on corruption charges. (Under Brazilian law, a president is not impeached until he or she is convicted by the Senate, legal scholars say.) “It's painfully obvious that Temer is a slap in the face to Brazilian democracy,” said Creuza Maria Oliveira, the president of the National Federation of Domestic Workers, which represents millions of maids who benefited from the strengthening of labor laws by Ms. Rousseff. “Dilma is a champion of the poor,” said Ms. Oliveira, who was among the supporters of Ms. Rousseff who accompanied her to the Senate this week. “Temer is a champion of his own political class, which he wants to shield from justice. ” Some prominent business and political figures in Brazil counter that Mr. Temer, a former speaker in the lower house, has the political skills needed to muster support in a fractious, discredited Congress for ambitious measures aimed at increasing investment in the economy and easing a major pension crisis. Mr. Temer's administration has “all the conditions needed to embark on a new route,” Philipp Schiemer, the head of  's operations in Brazil, told reporters in recent days. “We need to decide if we want a Brazil like Venezuela or a Brazil inserted in the new world. ” Still others, including Ms. Rousseff, contend that the ease with which the political elite shunted aside the president will bring more divisiveness and political tumult in Brazil. “This is serious because other presidents of the republic will have to deal with this,” Ms. Rousseff said this week in her testimony in the Senate, comparing her ouster to the coups toppling Brazilian leaders throughout much of the 20th century. “If that isn't political instability, then I don't know what is. ” Unlike many of the politicians who led the charge to oust her, Ms. Rousseff, 68, remains a rare breed in Brazil: a prominent leader who has not been accused of illegally enriching herself. Instead, her trial revolved around a contentious legal question of whether she committed an impeachable offense by employing budgetary tricks to conceal yawning deficits. Ms. Rousseff repeatedly insisted that she did nothing illegal, pointing out that her predecessors also manipulated the federal budget. But her opponents argued that the scale of her administration's transfers of funds between giant public banks, to the tune of about $11 billion, seriously eroded Brazil's economic credibility and helped her get   unfairly in 2014. Ms. Rousseff will not go to jail after her conviction, but she expressed defiance throughout her trial, insisting that Brazil's economic crisis was largely the result of shifts in the global economy that cut commodities prices. A bureaucrat who specialized in overseeing giant public companies in Brazil's energy industry, Ms. Rousseff had not held elected office until her predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, anointed her as his heir after other leaders in the Workers' Party were tarnished by a   scandal. As a divorced grandmother known as an avid reader of literature, she was an exception in the   political scene. In addition to serving as Mr. da Silva's   chief of staff, she was known for her involvement with the Palmares Armed Revolutionary Vanguard, an urban guerrilla group, in her youth. Agents of the military dictatorship captured Ms. Rousseff and tortured her repeatedly in the early 1970s. But the qualities that made her a compelling chief of staff did not carry over when she became president. Her autocratic persona and short temper became legendary in Brasília, a capital where   deals are customary when forging and nurturing alliances with an array of bickering parties. Many voters also felt betrayed after Ms. Rousseff's   campaign, when she narrowly won on promises to maintain extensive state control over the economy, resulting in generous public spending. But once   she went in another direction, appointing a finance minister who tried to win approval for   policies. “She simply lied through her teeth to get   forming a wave of national indignation,” said Antonio Risério, a historian and cultural commentator. “Upon perceiving that they voted for one person and elected another, the majority of the population started to want her head. ” With Ms. Rousseff deposed, the Workers' Party, a dominant force in Brazilian politics for much of the past decade and a half, is now scrambling to find its way in a political landscape where conservative voices are growing more powerful. João Santana, the party's campaign strategist who helped Ms. Rousseff win two presidential elections, faces charges of illegally receiving millions of dollars in offshore accounts from the bribery scheme involving the national oil company. Even more damaging for the party, federal investigators are seeking graft charges against Mr. da Silva, the former labor leader universally known as Lula, who was president from 2003 to 2010. The move adds to mounting legal problems faced by Mr. da Silva, who is still signaling that he plans to run for president in 2018. Ms. Rousseff found herself increasingly isolated in recent months, with many in her party quietly withdrawing their support. But senators offered her a morsel of consolation by voting to allow her to run for public office, overruling an effort to make her ineligible from doing so for several years. And some in Ms. Rousseff's party defended her as she made her   effort before the Senate this week. “You veered from the narrative when you were elected president of the republic as a woman, from the left, a former militant against the dictatorship, without a husband to pose by your side in the photographs,” said Regina Sousa, a Workers' Party senator from Piauí in northeast Brazil. “You never fit in the cute little dress designed by the conservative elite of this country,” Ms. Sousa added. Heated tempers marked the trial in the Senate. Crying as she spoke, Janaína Paschoal, the law professor who was an author of the impeachment request, said she had been inspired by God and that she was seeking impeachment for the good of Ms. Rousseff's grandchildren. Ms. Rousseff's lawyer, José Eduardo Cardozo, said he was stunned that her opponents had dragged Ms. Rousseff's family into the acerbic debate, pointing out that Ms. Rousseff was never accused of embezzling public funds to benefit her family. “If you want to condemn her, go ahead, but don't mock the honor of a dignified woman,” said Mr. Cardozo, also crying as he spoke.",False,"BRASLIA     The Senate on Wednesday impeached Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's first female president, and removed her from office for the rest of her term, the capstone of a power struggle that has consumed the nation for months and toppled one of the hemisphere's most powerful political parties.

25,6831,25226,"Yesterday, Outraged by Apple's Tax Dodge. Today, by Its Tax Bill. - The NY Times",NY Times,Alan Rappeport,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   American lawmakers have for years been assailing companies for dodging taxes with overseas maneuvers. But now that the EU has done something about it by trying to wrest billions of dollars from Apple, those officials have offered a response viewed by many as rife with hypocrisy: collective outrage. Tax avoidance has become a lightning rod as the presidential campaign has taken on a strong populist cast, and leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress have demanded that companies be forced to pay their fair share. Both Clinton and Donald J. Trump have vowed to crack down on deals that allow companies to relocate their headquarters overseas to lower their tax bills, and the Treasury Department has made limiting international loopholes a priority. Despite all that, Apple  —   a company long accused of being overly creative at avoiding taxes  —   now has the federal government standing up for it after the EU's executive commission ordered Ireland on Tuesday to collect $14. 5 billion in taxes from the company. And for at least some American politicians, the anger stems from a simple calculation: The tax money that the EU extracts from Apple should be going to the USA Treasury, not that they have figured out how to make that happen. “It's remarkable to think that the administration has been flying over to Brussels on taxpayers' dollars to lobby the EU against collecting taxes owed in Europe when they're not collecting the taxes owed here,” said Clark Gascoigne, deputy director of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition. “It's terribly ironic. ” Most lawmakers and business groups do not see it that way. They defended Apple by arguing that the EU was overstepping its authority and reinterpreting international tax law to unfairly penalize the company. Some called it a new brand of protectionism. The Treasury Department said the ruling was “deeply troubling. ” The Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization for America's largest companies, called the move a “reckless and dramatic overreach” and an “act of aggression” against a company and a sovereign government. In Congress, lawmakers in both parties have urged the Treasury Department to be tougher on European officials as they aggressively investigate what they call undue tax benefits given by member nations to leading American companies. Members of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter in May to Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, urging him to consider retaliation that would include doubling taxes on companies and individuals in Europe. The European Commission “is using a theory to make tax law, is doing it in a way that is retroactive and that overrides national tax law authority, in our view,” Mr. Lew said Wednesday at a Brookings Institution event previewing this weekend's meeting in China of the Group of 20 largest industrial economies. He pushed back against the idea that Treasury is condoning tax evasion, saying legislation that prevents companies from parking income overseas to avoid being taxed in the USA “will see action probably not in my tenure but early in the next administration. ” The European Commission's ruling has even managed to forge a rare moment of agreement between the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Chuck Schumer, a NY Democrat who is likely to become the next leader of his party in the Senate. “This decision is awful,” Mr. Ryan said in a statement. “Slamming a company with a giant tax bill  —   years after the fact  —   sends exactly the wrong message to job creators on both sides of the Atlantic. ” Mr. Schumer said in an interview that he and Mr. Ryan had been discussing possibilities for a corporate tax overhaul for next year. He said he was optimistic about the prospect of requiring corporate money to return to the USA at a lower tax rate, with some of the proceeds being used to fund a large investment in infrastructure. The action taken by the EU, he said, should be an impetus to get moving on such legislation. “The EU is going to grab this money, instead of the U. S.,” Mr. Schumer said. “It's a big signpost here for us. Let's get moving. ” He added: “We're trying to protect our U. S. tax base. That money sitting over there should be here in the U. S. not in Ireland and not in the EU” The bipartisan “consensus” that the corporate tax rate should be cut in exchange for loopholes closures emerged in Obama's first term, yet Congress has not formally drafted a bill, much less voted on one. Tax experts said that without a deep cut in the tax rate, companies like Apple would be better off paying back taxes in Europe than repatriating their overseas cash. “This is not taking 13 billion euros out of the U. S. Treasury's pocket and U. S. taxpayers' pocket and putting it into Europe,” said Jeffery M. Kadet, a tax lecturer at the University of Washington School of Law. “They wouldn't be bringing this money back to the U. S. anyway. ” Reuven S.   who directs the international taxation program at the University of Michigan Law School, said that the EU had a strong case for collecting the taxes from Apple and that if the situation were reversed, Americans would be clamoring to collect taxes from a foreign company. “Just because it happens to be an American company, to say that the EU should not take action, I think, is the height of hypocrisy,” Mr.   said. While most lawmakers condemned the treatment of Apple, one prominent former senator said he was pleased to see Europe take action. Carl M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations when it examined Apple's use of tax havens in 2013, said the European Commission should fill the vacuum left by lackadaisical tax enforcement in the USA. “The royalties Apple collects for its overseas sales of products designed and developed in the U. S. should be taxed in the U. S.,” Mr. Levin said. “But Apple has avoided the billions of dollars of taxes it owes the U. S. by transferring its intellectual property to itself in Ireland. ” Blaming Apple and the Internal Revenue Service, he added, “When Apple used those tax avoidance schemes, it is understandable that Europe would try to go after them. ” It remains to be seen if corporate tax reform will be a priority for the next administration, but the language used by both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump on the campaign trail suggests that it is a strong possibility. Mrs. Clinton has released a formal proposal to prevent   corporate inversions and to reward companies that keep their operations in the USA. Mr. Trump, who has called for a boycott of Apple products, has threatened to punish companies that relocate to other countries by imposing taxes on products they sell in the USA. The news that a corporate giant might have evaded billions of dollars in taxes could become another populist rallying cry. “There's a reason Trump and Bernie Sanders did so well in the campaign this year,” Mr. Gascoigne, of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition, said. “People are fed up with the kinds of   deals that are happening at the large multinational companies at the expense of the American people. ”",False,"WASHINGTON     American lawmakers have for years been assailing companies for dodging taxes with overseas maneuvers. But now that the EU has done something about it by trying to wrest billions of dollars from Apple, those officials have offered a response viewed by many as rife with hypocrisy: collective outrage. Tax avoidance has become a lightning rod as the presidential campaign has taken on a strong populist cast, and leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress have demanded that companies be forced to pay their fair share. Both Clinton and Donald J. Trump have vowed to crack down on deals that allow companies to relocate their headquarters overseas to lower their tax bills, and the Treasury Department has made limiting international loopholes a priority. Despite all that, Apple     a company long accused of being overly creative at avoiding taxes     now has the federal government standing up for it after the EU's executive commission ordered Ireland on Tuesday to collect $14. 5 billion in taxes from the company. And for at least some American politicians, the anger stems from a simple calculation: The tax money that the EU extracts from Apple should be going to the USA Treasury, not that they have figured out how to make that happen. It's remarkable to think that the administration has been flying over to Brussels on taxpayers' dollars to lobby the EU against collecting taxes owed in Europe when they're not collecting the taxes owed here, said Clark Gascoigne, deputy director of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition. It's terribly ironic.  Most lawmakers and business groups do not see it that way. They defended Apple by arguing that the EU was overstepping its authority and reinterpreting international tax law to unfairly penalize the company. Some called it a new brand of protectionism. The Treasury Department said the ruling was deeply troubling.  The Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization for America's largest companies, called the move a reckless and dramatic overreach and an act of aggression against a company and a sovereign government. In Congress, lawmakers in both parties have urged the Treasury Department to be tougher on European officials as they aggressively investigate what they call undue tax benefits given by member nations to leading American companies. Members of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter in May to Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, urging him to consider retaliation that would include doubling taxes on companies and individuals in Europe. The European Commission is using a theory to make tax law, is doing it in a way that is retroactive and that overrides national tax law authority, in our view, Mr. Lew said Wednesday at a Brookings Institution event previewing this weekend's meeting in China of the Group of 20 largest industrial economies. He pushed back against the idea that Treasury is condoning tax evasion, saying legislation that prevents companies from parking income overseas to avoid being taxed in the USA will see action probably not in my tenure but early in the next administration.  The European Commission's ruling has even managed to forge a rare moment of agreement between the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Chuck Schumer, a NY Democrat who is likely to become the next leader of his party in the Senate. This decision is awful, Mr. Ryan said in a statement. Slamming a company with a giant tax bill     years after the fact     sends exactly the wrong message to job creators on both sides of the Atlantic.  Mr. Schumer said in an interview that he and Mr. Ryan had been discussing possibilities for a corporate tax overhaul for next year. He said he was optimistic about the prospect of requiring corporate money to return to the USA at a lower tax rate, with some of the proceeds being used to fund a large investment in infrastructure. The action taken by the EU, he said, should be an impetus to get moving on such legislation. The EU is going to grab this money, instead of the U. S., Mr. Schumer said. It's a big signpost here for us. Let's get moving.  He added: We're trying to protect our U. S. tax base. That money sitting over there should be here in the U. S. not in Ireland and not in the EU The bipartisan consensus that the corporate tax rate should be cut in exchange for loopholes closures emerged in Obama's first term, yet Congress has not formally drafted a bill, much less voted on one. Tax experts said that without a deep cut in the tax rate, companies like Apple would be better off paying back taxes in Europe than repatriating their overseas cash. This is not taking 13 billion euros out of the U. S. Treasury's pocket and U. S. taxpayers' pocket and putting it into Europe, said Jeffery M. Kadet, a tax lecturer at the University of Washington School of Law. They wouldn't be bringing this money back to the U. S. anyway.  Reuven S.   who directs the international taxation program at the University of Michigan Law School, said that the EU had a strong case for collecting the taxes from Apple and that if the situation were reversed, Americans would be clamoring to collect taxes from a foreign company. Just because it happens to be an American company, to say that the EU should not take action, I think, is the height of hypocrisy, Mr.   said. While most lawmakers condemned the treatment of Apple, one prominent former senator said he was pleased to see Europe take action. Carl M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations when it examined Apple's use of tax havens in 2013, said the European Commission should fill the vacuum left by lackadaisical tax enforcement in the USA. The royalties Apple collects for its overseas sales of products designed and developed in the U. S. should be taxed in the U. S., Mr. Levin said. But Apple has avoided the billions of dollars of taxes it owes the U. S. by transferring its intellectual property to itself in Ireland.  Blaming Apple and the Internal Revenue Service, he added, When Apple used those tax avoidance schemes, it is understandable that Europe would try to go after them.  It remains to be seen if corporate tax reform will be a priority for the next administration, but the language used by both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump on the campaign trail suggests that it is a strong possibility. Mrs. Clinton has released a formal proposal to prevent   corporate inversions and to reward companies that keep their operations in the USA. Mr. Trump, who has called for a boycott of Apple products, has threatened to punish companies that relocate to other countries by imposing taxes on products they sell in the USA. The news that a corporate giant might have evaded billions of dollars in taxes could become another populist rallying cry. There's a reason Trump and Bernie Sanders did so well in the campaign this year, Mr. Gascoigne, of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition, said. People are fed up with the kinds of   deals that are happening at the large multinational companies at the expense of the American people. "
26,6832,25227,How to Win Friends and Influence People (on Fake Mars) - The NY Times,NY Times,Katie Rogers,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Amid the craggy landscape near the Mauna Loa volcano on Hawaii, six researchers lived for a year as if they were on Mars. Confined to a    habitat inside and spacesuits outside, the researchers spent their time extracting water from dry rock, growing plants and crawling through gigantic lava tubes. But when members of the group were released from their habitat on Sunday, they emphasized one key takeaway: They had spent a lot of time trying not to drive themselves or each other crazy. Two significant obstacles for the researchers were the physical and the emotional isolation. They began living at the habitat in August 2015 as part of the     project. They were the fourth group to take up residence there, and stayed longer than any previous group. Experts say that travel to Mars may be possible by the 2030s, so if you're among the many who hope to one day complete the approximately    journey to the red planet  —   or if you want to try your hand at a year living in   isolation  —   here are a few tips on how to get along with your colleagues at one of the most extreme workplaces in the solar system. People who are not working on Mars or in a   environment usually do not have this luxury, but according to Christiane Heinicke, a    German physicist and engineer, democracy was a part of the personnel process on fake Mars. “During the selection process, we were trekking together in the Rocky Mountains,” Dr. Heinicke said in an email. “Afterwards, everyone voted anonymously for their preferred commander, which turned out to be Carmel,” as in Carmel Johnston, a soil scientist from Montana. Nobody wants to hear the words “emergency” and “Mars” in the same sentence, but in this case, a glitch in the workday helped temporarily repair group relations. “It really helps to have an emergency to work on together, because it reunites the group,” Dr. Heinicke told journalists after her group was released. “And everybody has new motivation to work together and make it through the whole year. ” During their time in the habitat, the researchers had only small spaces to themselves, including a bed, a desk and some storage space. Aside from making sure you bring “good music” to drown out your colleagues' noise in close quarters, it will help to nurture your own side projects and hobbies, Ms. Heinicke said. “Bring a lot of meaningful, stimulating projects to work, and be open to collaborate with others,” she said. “More generally: Be adaptable the mission is very unlikely to be fully predictable. ” Her colleague, Cyprien Verseux, echoed that sentiment: “Bring books,” he told journalists after he was released. If all else fails, start a band, make finger puppets, exercise or even do your taxes to pass the time. This one is a universal truth on Earth as well as on Mars, but in the habitat, there were fewer opportunities to escape one another. Mr. Verseux said that “monotony, always in the same place, always with the same people” were among his biggest challenges while living in the domed research lab that the group called home, where the only respite from the cabin  —   going outside  —   required wearing a mock spacesuit. Another key takeaway from the mission, Ms. Heinicke said, is that not everyone is built to live in an extreme environment and in   isolation. “Some thrive and ‘infect' each other with ideas and work on a large number of joint projects,” she said. “The others decay and progressively slip into a worse and worse mood.

27,7800,26536,Mexicans Accuse President of ‘Historic Error' in Welcoming Trump - The NY Times,NY Times,Azam Ahmed and Elisabeth Malkin,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"MEXICO CITY  —   If President Enrique Peña Nieto invited Donald J. Trump to visit Mexico for a dialogue in the interest of democracy, the message has fallen on deaf ears. Instead, the predominant feeling here in the Mexican capital is one of betrayal. “It's a historic error,” said Enrique Krauze, a   historian. “You confront tyrants. You don't appease them. ” On Mexico's most popular morning television show on Wednesday, a livid Mr. Krauze likened the president's meeting with Mr. Trump to the decision by Neville Chamberlain, then the British prime minister, to sit down with Hitler in Munich in 1938. “It isn't brave to meet in private with somebody who has insulted and denigrated” Mexicans, Mr. Krauze said. “It isn't dignified to simply have a dialogue. ” Yes, many Mexicans say, it was Mr. Trump who offended the people of Mexico with his disparaging comments about migrants and his promises to build a border wall paid for by Mexico. But for many Mexicans, the surprising invitation from Mr. Peña Nieto  —   who has likened Mr. Trump's language to that of Hitler and Mussolini in the past  —   is even worse. Newspapers, television stations, social media and all manner of national communications were awash in vitriol at the idea of a meeting between the two men, while political analysts on both sides of the border said they were mystified about why Mr. Peña Nieto invited Mr. Trump. “It is Peña Nieto's worst mistake so far and one we still don't understand,” said Vidal Romero, the head of the political science department at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, a university in Mexico City. “This would only hurt him. ” But as others pointed out, Mr. Trump is the Republican presidential candidate, and not the first to visit a Mexican president. John McCain came to Mexico when he was running against Obama. “At the end of the day, this is the Republican candidate,” said Rafael Fernández de Castro, a professor at Syracuse University and former foreign policy adviser to Felipe Calderón, the previous Mexican president. “The U. S. electorate put him in this position, and Peña is respecting that. ” Ultimately, he said, foreign policy cannot always be guided by public opinion, no matter the political consequences. “He has everything to lose in the media, but this is about governing,” Mr. Fernández de Castro said. “He had no other choice  —   a good relationship with the U. S. is essential for the   of Mexico. ” From that perspective, with his approval ratings already low, Mr. Peña Nieto may have less to lose than is commonly thought. If the goal was to ensure national interests in the event Mr. Trump wins, then the furor over the visit seemed a political cost the government was willing to take. Still, there is “unanimity that this is a giant farce,” said Jesús   Márquez, a professor at the Tecnólogico de Monterrey in Mexico City and columnist for Reforma, a Mexico City newspaper. Mr. Peña Nieto “compared Mr. Trump to Mussolini and Hitler,” he added, “and now we invite Mussolini, we are going to negotiate with Hitler when he hasn't even won the election. ” After the men met, in what Mr. Trump described as an “excellent” occasion, they spoke at a very civil news conference. Mr. Peña Nieto promised to work with whichever candidate was elected and emphasized the importance of ties with the USA. “I shared with him the fact that there have been misunderstandings or affirmations that hurt and affected Mexicans in their perception of his candidacy,” Mr. Peña Nieto said he told Mr. Trump. “The Mexican people felt aggravated for comments that were formulated, but I am certain that he has a genuine interest in building a relationship that would lead us to provide better conditions for our people. ” While Mr. Trump hardly offered Mexicans the sort of apology many had hoped for, he was a far more chastened candidate than they had come to expect. He repeatedly lauded their hard work, and spoke of his “tremendous feeling” for Mexicans. “They are amazing people,” he noted. In the end, he called Mr. Peña Nieto a friend. Citing Mr. Trump's more respectful tone, the government described the meeting as a success. “It was a different Trump,” said Eduardo Sánchez, the president's spokesman. “The attitude of this Trump is different from the ones we have seen before today. ” But Shannon K. O'Neil, a Mexico expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in NY, said: “I don't see how that helped Peña Nieto. If the reason Peña was inviting Trump was to stand up to him and show his strength in front of somebody who has attacked Mexicans, then he failed. ” Other critics were less kind. “To put it mildly, I think it was the biggest humiliation a Mexican president has suffered on his own territory in the last 50 years,” said Esteban Illades, editor of Nexos, a magazine in Mexico. “He not only managed to make Trump look presidential, which is an incredibly hard thing to do, he managed to forgive Trump even though he didn't actually offer an apology in the first place. ” Mexican officials did not clearly articulate the reasons for the visit at first. Later, in a news release, the president explained the rationale for the meeting as being in the interest of democracy and to create a dialogue. In his remarks, Mr. Peña Nieto suggested that he wanted to fortify the nation's ties with its most important global partner, while standing up for Mexico. “I also made him notice and feel the great responsibility I have as president of Mexico, to defend the Mexican people, both those who are here and abroad,” Mr. Peña Nieto said after the meeting. Some argued that the invitation was a distraction from the domestic problems that have gnawed at the president. Violence is rising, new scandals seem to emerge regularly and the impunity that lies at the heart of discord in Mexico remains undisturbed. Most recently, the president was accused of plagiarizing a third of his law school thesis, which his office explained as an error in citation. Others were not convinced by that explanation, contending meeting with Mr. Trump hardly made the other problems go away. “I do not see this as a distraction to his problems the visit will only add to the problems he faces in Mexico,” said Jason Marczak, a director in the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, a research center. “Trump will come out of this meeting carrying the message of the meeting. ” “He will use Peña Nieto as a political pawn in his campaign,” he added.",False,"MEXICO CITY     If President Enrique Pea Nieto invited Donald J.

[The chances of Trump agreeing to a   debate are remote. But the man whose voice is influential with the growing voting bloc of Latinos in the USA is continuing to stretch traditional notions of journalistic objectivity with the full support of his bosses.  Ramos said his track record proves that he'd have no problem asking both Trump and Democrat Clinton probing questions. “I am a registered independent,” he said. “I am never partisan. ” He wrote in a Time magazine column last month that journalists, politicians and voters will “be judged by how we responded to Trump. Like it or not, this election is a plebiscite on the most divisive, polarizing and disruptive figure in American politics in decades. And neutrality is not an option. ” He wrote that people will be asked if they were brave enough to challenge Trump “when he insulted immigrants, Muslims, women, war heroes and people with disabilities? Are you on the record correcting his lies?” That led to criticism that Ramos, who anchors a program where many Latinos seek an unbiased look at the news, mixed advocacy with journalism. Conservative watchdogs the Media Research Center urged that Univision remove Ramos as an anchor, at least through Election Day. The history goes deeper: Trump ordered Ramos ejected from a news conference last year after Ramos questioned him about an immigration plan the journalist said was “full of empty promises. ” The first of three planned debates between Trump and Clinton is scheduled for Sept. 26. The commission on presidential debates is expected to announce moderators after Labor Day. In a regular column he writes for The NY Times Syndicate, Ramos said this week that it was “high time” for a Latino journalist to get one of those slots. He suggested Maria Elena Salinas from Univision, Jose   of Telemundo, Maria Hinojosa of NPR and ABC's Cecilia Vega or Tom Llamas as people who could do the job, but didn't mention himself. In a later interview, he expressed interest, and said his Time column shouldn't disqualify him. “What I've said is that we, as journalists, can't remain neutral when a politician makes racist remarks,” he said. “That's all. But in all our shows we report objectively about all the things (Trump) says and does. ” He noted that he questioned Clinton about Benghazi and her emails during a Democratic debate, asked vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine last weekend about possible conflicts of interest at the ClintonFoundation and has criticized Obama's deportation policies. Brent Bozell, president of the Media Research Center, said the Trump campaign would probably “burst out laughing” if Ramos were ever named a debate moderator. “It's slippery what he's saying, and it's unfortunate that he's been so slippery, when he's saying that he's just a journalist who is asking questions,” Bozell said. “That is just not true. He is an activist making statements. And some of them have been vicious about Trump. ” Daniel Coronell, Univision's news division's president, said he would support having Ramos as a debate moderator, although he believes there's little chance of Ramos or any other Latino journalist getting one of those slots.

What I've said is that we, as journalists, can't remain neutral when a politician makes racist remarks, he said. That's all. But in all our shows we report objectively about all the things (Trump) says and does.  He noted that he questioned Clinton about Benghazi and her emails during a Democratic debate, asked vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine last weekend about possible conflicts of interest at the ClintonFoundation and has criticized Obama's deportation policies. Brent Bozell, president of the Media Research Center, said the Trump campaign would probably burst out laughing if Ramos were ever named a debate moderator. It's slippery what he's saying, and it's unfortunate that he's been so slippery, when he's saying that he's just a journalist who is asking questions, Bozell said. That is just not true. He is an activist making statements. And some of them have been vicious about Trump.  Daniel Coronell, Univision's news division's president, said he would support having Ramos as a debate moderator, although he believes there's little chance of Ramos or any other Latino journalist getting one of those slots. Coronell said Univision has no problem with the stances that Ramos has taken. We are journalists, he said. But we are members of a community that demands respect from the candidates. "

[According to the Los Angeles Times, the survivors had filed a federal lawsuit against the theater chain, alleging the Aurora theater's lax security protocols led to the July 20, 2012 shooting attack in which 12 people were killed and 70 injured after gunman James Holmes opened fire during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises.  In May, a judge had reportedly warned the more than   plaintiffs in the suit that he was prepared to rule that Cinemark was not liable for the deaths, as the theater could not have predicted what Holmes would do. The judge reportedly urged the parties to settle, and Cinemark offered a settlement: $150, 000, to be split between the 41 plaintiffs. But four of the victims  —   including one who reportedly lost a child in the shooting, became paralyzed and lost another child she was carrying —   remained on. Cinemark won at trial, and, in June, submitted a $700, 000 legal bill. A judge this week ruled that the four plaintiffs who had remained on were liable to repay it. Marcus Weaver, a survivor who was shot in the shoulder during the attack, called Cinemark's settlement offer a “slap in the face,” though he had been prepared to accept it at the time with the hope that the theater chain would be forced to make improvements to its security. Now, the theater chain is apparently free of both all financial liability and the need to overhaul its safety procedures. “It's almost like everything was for naught,” he told the Times. Holmes was convicted on all counts last July and was sentenced to 12 consecutive life terms plus more than 3, 000 years in jail.

Mr. Farage responded to these accusations as slanderous commenting that: If anyone stoops to the level of using the epithet far right' to describe people who believe in   democracy, well clearly they are the ones that have lost the plot, not me.  I've never worked with groups on the extreme right or left. At the end of the day I'm someone that has come from business into politics and my motivation was that I thought the European project was taking away from my country democracy, free speech, the ability to control out borders. What I realise now, years on, was that what I saw going on in my country wasn't unique to us it actually has been happening in the [entire] Western world.  In an exclusive with Breitbart London, Dutch populist politician Geert Wilders discussed the rising Patriot Spring' noting that in Europe and America revolutions are brewing. They are peaceful and democratic, but they are going to send the elites home that are running our nations into the ground. "
37,19913,38658,Explosion Rocks SpaceX Launch Site in Florida During Test - Breitbart,Breitbart,Breitbart Tech,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)  —   A massive explosion rocked a SpaceX launch pad Thursday during a routine rocket test for a planned weekend launch. [There were no injuries, but the rocket and the satellite onboard were destroyed, SpaceX said in a statement.  The company was conducting a test firing of its unmanned Falcon rocket when the blast occurred shortly after 9 a. m. The test was in advance of a planned Saturday launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, which is next to NASA's Kennedy Space Center. It was supposed to hoist an Israeli communications satellite. SpaceX said that in preparation for Thursday's engine firing  —   a test carried out a few days before every launch  —   “there was an anomaly on the pad resulting in the loss of the vehicle and its payload. ” There were no additional details provided. It's the same kind of SpaceX rocket used to launch space station supplies for NASA, and represented a major setback for the space agency's plans for future cargo hauls and, ultimately, astronaut flights. Buildings several miles away shook from the blast, and multiple explosions continued for several minutes. Dark smoke filled the overcast sky. A   later, a black cloud hung low across the eastern horizon. TV cameras showed smoke coming from the launch pad two hours later. The rocket was still standing, although the top third or so was clearly bent over. The explosion occurred at Launch Complex 40 at the Air Force station, right next door to Kennedy Space Center. NASA said Kennedy emergency staff was on standby. At the same time, personnel were monitoring the air for any toxic fumes. The Air Force stressed there was no threat to public safety in the surrounding communities. The initial blast sent   NASA employees rushing frantically outside to see what happened. At first, it sounded like lightning, but was followed by the sounds of more explosions, then more and more. SpaceX is one of two companies shipping supplies to the International Space Station for NASA. It's also working on a crew capsule to ferry station U. S. astronauts that first flight was supposed to come as early as next year. Two NASA astronauts were conducting a spacewalk 250 miles up, outside the International Space Station, when the explosion occurred. Mission Control did not notify them of the accident, saying all communication was focused on the spacewalk. The explosion is a major blow for SpaceX  —   and also for NASA, which relies on the company to keep the space station equipped with food, science experiments and other supplies. The   company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, had been ramping up with frequent launches to make up for a backlog created by a launch accident in June 2015.

44,21796,40543,U.S. Navy Veteran Protests Kaepernick at Chargers Game: 'Respect or Leave' - Breitbart,Breitbart,Michelle Moons,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"SAN DIEGO  —   When Colin Kaepernick arrived at Qualcomm Stadium on Thursday evening, U. S. Navy veteran J. D. McCallum was ready  —   with a protest sign calling out San Francisco 49ers quarterback for sitting out the national anthem. [The sign read: “COLIN, RESPECT OR LEAVE WHAT US VETERANS FOUGHT FOR. ”  Mccallum, a Chargers fan from Palm Springs, explained on camera to Breitbart News why he found it important to be at this game where military service members were to be honored  —   and where Kaepernick continued his protest against the anthem.  “I want to support our troops, me and my fellow veterans,” Mccallum told Breitbart News. Kaepernick, he said, was “disrespecting our flag and everything that we fought for. ” Kaepernick, who wears the #7 jersey, has been refusing to stand for the   Banner before football games to protest   shootings of black Americans, in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. Ahead of Thursday night's football game, earlier photographs of Kaepernick were found showing him in practice wearing his socks depicting police officers as pigs. Mccallum told Breitbart News that he had never displayed a protest sign before coming to this   game, but said that it was that important to him this nigh, t given Kaepernick's “disrespect. ” His daughter brought him all the way from Palm Springs to attend this game, and she was with him at the game. Friends at the senior center helped him make the sign that he brought to the game. All current and former members of the military were asked to stand during the second quarter of the   game, and were honored for their service amidst the 47, 407 people in attendance. During halftime, six veterans of the Vietnam War were specifically honored. The lights went out in the stadium, a flag was unfurled over a portion of the middle of the field, and fans held up cell phone lights.  Kaepernick took to Instagram last July in response to the Alton Sterling shooting in Louisiana, posting the inflammatory words, “This is what lynchings look like in 2016!” Last Sunday, the quarterback told reporters he will continue to sit: “When there's significant change and I feel like that flag represents what it's supposed to represent, this country is representing people the way that it's supposed to, I'll stand. ” He added: People are dying in vain because this country isn't holding their end of the bargain up, as far as giving freedom and justice, liberty to everybody. That's something that's not happening. I've seen videos, I've seen circumstances where men and women that have been in the military have come back and been treated unjustly by the country they have fought for, and have been murdered by the country they fought for, on our land. That's not right. NFL executives, former fans, Kaepernick's own birth mother, former 49ers football star Jerry Rice, and many others have criticized the football player's protest, Kaepernick said last Sunday that he has plans to engage in more activism: “There are things that I have in the works right now that I'm working on to put together in the future and have come to fruition soon. ” He also had harsh words for both major party presidential candidates. When asked, Kaepernick couldn't point to a specific issue that he wanted to see change on to mark a “success. ” In the second half of Thursday night's gameKaepernick did remain standing for God Bless America, and clapped as it concluded. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana ",False,"SAN DIEGO     When Colin Kaepernick arrived at Qualcomm Stadium on Thursday evening, U. S. Navy veteran J. D. McCallum was ready     with a protest sign calling out San Francisco 49ers quarterback for sitting out the national anthem. [The sign read: COLIN, RESPECT OR LEAVE WHAT US VETERANS FOUGHT FOR.   Mccallum, a Chargers fan from Palm Springs, explained on camera to Breitbart News why he found it important to be at this game where military service members were to be honored     and where Kaepernick continued his protest against the anthem.  I want to support our troops, me and my fellow veterans, Mccallum told Breitbart News. Kaepernick, he said, was disrespecting our flag and everything that we fought for.  Kaepernick, who wears the #7 jersey, has been refusing to stand for the   Banner before football games to protest   shootings of black Americans, in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. Ahead of Thursday night's football game, earlier photographs of Kaepernick were found showing him in practice wearing his socks depicting police officers as pigs. Mccallum told Breitbart News that he had never displayed a protest sign before coming to this   game, but said that it was that important to him this nigh, t given Kaepernick's disrespect.  His daughter brought him all the way from Palm Springs to attend this game, and she was with him at the game. Friends at the senior center helped him make the sign that he brought to the game. All current and former members of the military were asked to stand during the second quarter of the   game, and were honored for their service amidst the 47, 407 people in attendance. During halftime, six veterans of the Vietnam War were specifically honored. The lights went out in the stadium, a flag was unfurled over a portion of the middle of the field, and fans held up cell phone lights.  Kaepernick took to Instagram last July in response to the Alton Sterling shooting in Louisiana, posting the inflammatory words, This is what lynchings look like in 2016! Last Sunday, the quarterback told reporters he will continue to sit: When there's significant change and I feel like that flag represents what it's supposed to represent, this country is representing people the way that it's supposed to, I'll stand.  He added: People are dying in vain because this country isn't holding their end of the bargain up, as far as giving freedom and justice, liberty to everybody. That's something that's not happening. I've seen videos, I've seen circumstances where men and women that have been in the military have come back and been treated unjustly by the country they have fought for, and have been murdered by the country they fought for, on our land. That's not right. NFL executives, former fans, Kaepernick's own birth mother, former 49ers football star Jerry Rice, and many others have criticized the football player's protest, Kaepernick said last Sunday that he has plans to engage in more activism: There are things that I have in the works right now that I'm working on to put together in the future and have come to fruition soon.

45,21861,40608,Brazil: Sao Paulo a 'War Zone' after Impeachment,Breitbart,Frances Martel,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"For the third day in a row, leftist agitators stormed Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo, hurling rocks at police, detonating “homemade bombs” and turning the city's most trafficked streets into a “war zone” to protest the impeachment of leftist former president Dilma Rousseff. [Portugal's Diario de Noticias described Sao Paulo as a “war zone” Wednesday night, highlighting individual instances of violence that exemplified the chaos in the city. Protesters blockaded roads with garbage fires, hurling rocks at police, and detonating homemade bombs near police to prevent them from curbing the mass of protesters.  Folha de Sao Paulo, the city's biggest newspaper, reports seven injuries, four photographers and a policeman among them. At least two of the photographers were hit with shrapnel from the homemade bombs. Two others, lost in the crowd, “were beaten by military police. ” The protesters also appeared to take their wrath out on the media, as some stormed the headquarters of Folha, one caught by a photographer throwing a chair into its entrance.  O Globo, another Brazilian outlet, reports that the protests were not limited to blocking streets and vandalizing media locations. “Bus stops were destroyed, shops attacked and bank branches vandalized,” the newspaper notes. Another injury occurred when a woman trying to drive through the illegal assembly, fearing for her life, tried to drive through the crowd and hit a female agitator. The newspaper notes that police have not estimated the size of the crowd. Police attempted to dispel the crowds with tear gas and water cannons, but were attacked with rocks instead.   Wednesday was the third day such protests occurred, with most media reporting before Wednesday that these protests were significantly smaller than those attracting millions in March in favor in impeachment. The protests this week, organized by a coalition of Brazilian leftist special interest groups, are meant to protest the Senate's vote to impeach Rousseff, finalized Wednesday. The vote means Rousseff will be permanently replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer, until December 2018. Rousseff lost her position after being found guilty of misrepresenting the nation's finances, misleading investors to generate more revenue for the federal government. Popular opinion turned against Rousseff for a different scandal, however: the Petrobras corruption scheme, known as “Operation Car Wash. ” During the tenure of her predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the   oil corporation Petrobras systematically overcharged on contract projects. Rousseff's Workers' Party (PT) colleagues pocketed the difference to the tune of millions. Rousseff was Minister of Energy while the scheme was ongoing. In March, shortly before the vote to hold an impeachment trial against Rousseff, police detained da Silva for his involvement in the Petrobras scheme. Rousseff rapidly appointed him her chief of staff, shielding him from prosecution and triggering waves of   protests nationwide. While Rousseff denied that she appointed him to her cabinet to obstruct the investigation, Judge Sergio Moro, who was in charge of the case at the time, released an audio wiretap of a conversation in which Rousseff promised da Silva she would do just that should prosecutors get too close to finding evidence against him. The PT's ouster may not guarantee stability for Brazil, however, as prosecutors say they have evidence that Temer, too, was involved in pocketing illicit money from the corporation.

The North American Free Trade Agreement needs to be improved, he said. The border is porous and must to be secured. Criminals, guns, drugs, slaves and money pass back and forth with terrifying ease. Mr. Pena Nieto went out of his way to complain about guns being smuggled across the border into Mexico, a humiliating shot at Mr. Obama and his former Attorney General Eric Holder who were caught in a scheme to ship   guns to drug dealers and kingpins in Mexico. He also seemed to scold Mr. Obama's   policy as a blinking neon “welcome” sign, drawing tens of thousands of people from all over the world into his country on their way into America. “There is still a joint challenge including the increasing number of   who cross through our country in order to reach the USA, therein creating serious human crises,” he said.

58,26238,44993,Reuters: Working Class Democrats from Famous Rust Belt Town Rally Behind Trump's Populist Message,Breitbart,Breitbart News,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"In a special report for Reuters titled “Why an emblematic American city has turned to Trump,” Timothy Aeppel writes of the   travails of the once thriving factory town of Muncie, Indiana, where white working class voters are rallying behind Trump's populist message  —   many voting Republican for the first time. [One night a month, retired auto workers shuffle into a former elementary school classroom here to discuss their legal fight against the company that cancelled their health care benefits seven years ago.  But the conversation often turns quickly to presidential politics. “It can get pretty heated,” says Gerald Poor, the group's    president, of their political discussions. “I call it to order if it gets out of hand. ” Their anger is understandable. The group is a remnant of a   United Auto Workers union local, which at its peak in the 1960s represented over 5, 000 workers who made transmissions in Muncie for BorgWarner Inc, the global auto parts maker. An American flag drapes the wall at one end of the room, portraits of former labor bosses line the other, salvaged from a union hall that had its own baseball field. For this group of mostly white,   men, the last two decades have brought much loss. In this election  —   with the victory of the populist Trump as the Republicans nominee and the strong run by the populist Bernie Sanders for the Democrats crown  —   many say they feel they're finally being heard again.   white men were once a force to be reckoned with in American politics. Many here speak wistfully of how John F. Kennedy stopped at BorgWarner to talk to workers when he campaigned in 1960. For these men, this year's election is a rare taste of the clout they once took for granted. In the primary, Trump received the most votes of any candidate in either party in Delaware County, which encompasses Muncie. Just over 52 percent of Republican voters went for Trump. Democrats picked Sanders over Clinton by an even wider margin. “Candidates in the past made a lot of promises to the working class in this country and failed to follow through with it,” says    Bruce Reynolds, who followed his father and grandfather into a career at BorgWarner. Gazing through the rusted chain link fence that encircles the sprawling, abandoned factory, where he notes with precision that he worked for “32 and a half years,” he says he's still skeptical of both side's promises. Neither Trump nor Clinton was his first choice. Reynolds and his wife voted for Sanders in the primary, he says. Among other things, they couldn't support Clinton: She's the wife of former President Bill Clinton, who signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which many here blame for Muncie's economic decline. [  …    ] An analysis by Reuters found Delaware County is an extreme example of the declining fortunes of America's white   men. In 2000, white men with less than a college degree accounted for about   of all white men living in the county. By 2014, their proportion had dropped by about 5 percentage points, according to the U. S. Census Bureau. But while this group's share of the population held relatively steady, the earnings of white men with   jobs had fallen dramatically. In 2000, 47 percent of white men working full time were in the bottom third of earners, with incomes of $50, 000 or less based on 2015 dollars. By 2014, 60 percent of them were in the bottom third. Meanwhile, the percentage of white men in   jobs making between $50, 000 and $100, 000 dropped from 43 percent to 32 percent. And the percentage in the ranks of earners above $100, 000 slipped from 11 percent to 8 percent. In essence, white men in Muncie have slid down from every rung of the economic ladder. They have clustered at the bottom, poorer and more isolated than before, even as the overall U. S. economy has grown and globalized. The same trend is visible in faded industrial pockets from New Jersey and upstate NY to Alabama and Kentucky. According to the data, in about 1, 800 counties across the USA —  nearly 60 percent of those where data is available —  the share of white men in the lowest group of earners has grown over this period. The trend is particularly pronounced in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at NY University's Stern School of Business, studies how people adopt their political beliefs. “Trump is the first candidate to speak to —  and speak for —    white men in a long time,” Haidt says. That separates him from the last two Republican nominees. Mitt Romney, who lost in 2012, didn't do that, “and John McCain didn't particularly reach out to that constituency” in 2008. [  …    ] Muncie was once the epitome of America's muscular manufacturing economy. After natural gas was discovered here late in the 19th century, the city attracted dozens of   glass manufacturers, most notably Ball Corp, which built sprawling factories that churned out millions of mason jars. The auto industry followed, and Muncie became a hub for transmission making. The term “Muncie transmission” is still used by hot rod enthusiasts when talking about gearboxes produced here by General Motors Corp in the 1960s. One particularly powerful version is the “rock crusher,” used in Corvettes and other muscle cars. BorgWarner, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, has even deeper roots in Muncie than GM. Warner Gear was founded here in 1901 and merged with other businesses to create what became BorgWarner in the late 1920s. Many former workers here still call it Warner Gear. In the 1920s, a    team of sociologists picked the city to study the values in a typical American community. They called it “Middletown,” to conceal the identity of a place they felt was emblematic of the country as a whole. Muncie residents soon figured out it was all about them. [  …    ] Michael Hicks, a Ball State economist who studies manufacturing, says a mix of exasperation with unions and the political elite created the perfect opening for Trump. “It's always easier to blame a larger force for your problems, whether that's Mexicans or greedy factory owners,” he says. “But these people aren't stupid. They know the jobs aren't coming back. ” The bigger concern for many of them, he says, is what will happen to their children. The Reynolds family is a good example. Bruce Reynolds's oldest son, Bruce Jr, is a Baptist pastor and is supporting Trump, albeit reluctantly. “I don't think any of them can fix it,” Bruce Jr says of the fallout he sees from economic hardship in his congregation, from growing drug addiction to broken families. Reynolds's second son, Robert, followed his father into BorgWarner after high school. That job didn't last. After just four years, he was laid off in 1994 during a wave of downsizing. He and his father say it was a trauma from which he never fully recovered. “I make $8 an hour less now than I made 21 years ago,” says Robert, who enthusiastically backs Trump. After a series of   jobs, including a stint at   and as a manager of a video store, he now works overnight shifts at a warehouse for $18 an hour. He likes the job, he says, although the company recently cut three paid holidays, including the Fourth of July. [  …    ] To be sure, Muncie has retained some of its smaller factories, and other jobs have come in, including a call center that tracks down delinquent student loans and a Caterpillar Inc locomotive factory that moved into an old plant. But none of these are unionized, and the wages and benefits aren't as high as the old places offered. One frustration for locals is that the statistical measures of the economy don't seem to reflect what they see around them. Muncie's jobless rate is 5. 7 percent, less than one percentage point higher than the national rate of 4. 9 percent or Indiana's 4. 6 percent. But the impact of deindustrialization —  including the exodus of over 10, 000 factory jobs since 1970 in a city of only 70, 000 people —  is visible almost everywhere. Most of the departing companies tore down their factories, leaving lots strewn with weeds and rubble. BorgWarner left a handful of structures —  including a 1. 2    sprawl of red brick and steel near the edge of town. The city, especially the   white   neighborhoods on the south side, is now dotted with over 2, 000 abandoned houses. Some can't be occupied because they were contaminated by chemicals left behind by meth labs. [  …    ] But the economy alone doesn't explain Trump's appeal. Another family with deep roots at BorgWarner is the Lephart clan. At one point in the 1950s and 1960s, the patriarch and nine of his sons worked there  …    . David Lephart, whose father is one of the nine brothers, avoided the decline entirely through shrewd   and retraining —  but he's still a Trump supporter. He commutes to a UAW job as a pipefitter at a GM plant in Marion, Indiana. He earns about $100, 000 a year, with overtime, he says, and has put both of his children through college. The    says one thing that influenced his transition from Democrat to Republican was talking to his children, whom he describes as part of the “business world. ” His son is now a stockbroker in Indianapolis. “For the first half of my life, I thought Democrat was the only way to be,” Lephart says. “There's this belief that you can't be Republican and union —  but I don't believe that any more. ” Read the rest here.",False,"In a special report for Reuters titled Why an emblematic American city has turned to Trump, Timothy Aeppel writes of the   travails of the once thriving factory town of Muncie, Indiana, where white working class voters are rallying behind Trump's populist message     many voting Republican for the first time. [One night a month, retired auto workers shuffle into a former elementary school classroom here to discuss their legal fight against the company that cancelled their health care benefits seven years ago.  But the conversation often turns quickly to presidential politics. It can get pretty heated, says Gerald Poor, the group's    president, of their political discussions. I call it to order if it gets out of hand.  Their anger is understandable. The group is a remnant of a   United Auto Workers union local, which at its peak in the 1960s represented over 5, 000 workers who made transmissions in Muncie for BorgWarner Inc, the global auto parts maker. An American flag drapes the wall at one end of the room, portraits of former labor bosses line the other, salvaged from a union hall that had its own baseball field. For this group of mostly white,   men, the last two decades have brought much loss. In this election     with the victory of the populist Trump as the Republicans nominee and the strong run by the populist Bernie Sanders for the Democrats crown     many say they feel they're finally being heard again.   white men were once a force to be reckoned with in American politics. Many here speak wistfully of how John F. Kennedy stopped at BorgWarner to talk to workers when he campaigned in 1960. For these men, this year's election is a rare taste of the clout they once took for granted. In the primary, Trump received the most votes of any candidate in either party in Delaware County, which encompasses Muncie. Just over 52 percent of Republican voters went for Trump. Democrats picked Sanders over Clinton by an even wider margin. Candidates in the past made a lot of promises to the working class in this country and failed to follow through with it, says    Bruce Reynolds, who followed his father and grandfather into a career at BorgWarner. Gazing through the rusted chain link fence that encircles the sprawling, abandoned factory, where he notes with precision that he worked for 32 and a half years, he says he's still skeptical of both side's promises. Neither Trump nor Clinton was his first choice. Reynolds and his wife voted for Sanders in the primary, he says. Among other things, they couldn't support Clinton: She's the wife of former President Bill Clinton, who signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which many here blame for Muncie's economic decline. [      ] An analysis by Reuters found Delaware County is an extreme example of the declining fortunes of America's white   men. In 2000, white men with less than a college degree accounted for about   of all white men living in the county. By 2014, their proportion had dropped by about 5 percentage points, according to the U. S. Census Bureau. But while this group's share of the population held relatively steady, the earnings of white men with   jobs had fallen dramatically. In 2000, 47 percent of white men working full time were in the bottom third of earners, with incomes of $50, 000 or less based on 2015 dollars. By 2014, 60 percent of them were in the bottom third. Meanwhile, the percentage of white men in   jobs making between $50, 000 and $100, 000 dropped from 43 percent to 32 percent. And the percentage in the ranks of earners above $100, 000 slipped from 11 percent to 8 percent. In essence, white men in Muncie have slid down from every rung of the economic ladder. They have clustered at the bottom, poorer and more isolated than before, even as the overall U. S. economy has grown and globalized. The same trend is visible in faded industrial pockets from New Jersey and upstate NY to Alabama and Kentucky. According to the data, in about 1, 800 counties across the USA   nearly 60 percent of those where data is available   the share of white men in the lowest group of earners has grown over this period. The trend is particularly pronounced in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at NY University's Stern School of Business, studies how people adopt their political beliefs. Trump is the first candidate to speak to   and speak for     white men in a long time, Haidt says. That separates him from the last two Republican nominees. Mitt Romney, who lost in 2012, didn't do that, and John McCain didn't particularly reach out to that constituency in 2008. [      ] Muncie was once the epitome of America's muscular manufacturing economy. After natural gas was discovered here late in the 19th century, the city attracted dozens of   glass manufacturers, most notably Ball Corp, which built sprawling factories that churned out millions of mason jars. The auto industry followed, and Muncie became a hub for transmission making. The term Muncie transmission is still used by hot rod enthusiasts when talking about gearboxes produced here by General Motors Corp in the 1960s. One particularly powerful version is the rock crusher, used in Corvettes and other muscle cars. BorgWarner, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, has even deeper roots in Muncie than GM. Warner Gear was founded here in 1901 and merged with other businesses to create what became BorgWarner in the late 1920s. Many former workers here still call it Warner Gear. In the 1920s, a    team of sociologists picked the city to study the values in a typical American community. They called it Middletown, to conceal the identity of a place they felt was emblematic of the country as a whole. Muncie residents soon figured out it was all about them. [      ] Michael Hicks, a Ball State economist who studies manufacturing, says a mix of exasperation with unions and the political elite created the perfect opening for Trump. It's always easier to blame a larger force for your problems, whether that's Mexicans or greedy factory owners, he says. But these people aren't stupid. They know the jobs aren't coming back.  The bigger concern for many of them, he says, is what will happen to their children. The Reynolds family is a good example. Bruce Reynolds's oldest son, Bruce Jr, is a Baptist pastor and is supporting Trump, albeit reluctantly. I don't think any of them can fix it, Bruce Jr says of the fallout he sees from economic hardship in his congregation, from growing drug addiction to broken families.

[Just a few short weeks after the senior most level of Trump's campaign underwent a major shakeup, the trajectory of the race has shifted with Trump's poll numbers rising —   and Clinton's slipping.   “I think we've had a great few weeks, and yesterday was certainly great,” Trump said when asked if his immigration speech and trip to Mexico represented an inflection point in the campaign. “Yesterday was certainly great with the president of Mexico and the speech in front of 15, 000 people. You know there was 15, 000 yesterday, you saw that?” Trump looked presidential and extracted two key concessions from the Mexican president: namely, that there's a need to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and that the USA has a right to build a wall. “I have great respect for the President of Mexico,” Trump told Breitbart News. “I thought he was a fantastic person and a fantastic representative for Mexico. And I have great respect [for him]. He's a very fine person and I enjoyed being with him. ” Trump said that with the polls shifting and the momentum now on his side, Clinton is sliding. She has not held a press conference in over 270 days, and barely ever even holds public events anymore. Trump, who has held many press conferences as a candidate, highlighted this contrast in his interview with Breitbart News. “I think it's terrible that she doesn't do press conferences,” Trump said when asked about how Clinton hasn't held any in nearly a year. “She's being coddled by the press. They're trying to get her through it. I think it's a shame that she doesn't do press conferences. I think it's a shame. It's a shame for the American people. All she does is she'll put out a professionally   line about me, her agency will write up a line about me and she'll put that out. The whole thing is ridiculous. It's starting to backfire now. Enough about Trump. Everything she says is a negative ad about Trump. I think people don't want that. They'd like to see positive stuff. ” In particular, Trump noted that the media has refused to press Clinton to explain her “radical” immigration plan, which, according to Pew polling data, is opposed by at least 83% of the American electorate. During his immigration address in Phoenix, Trump challenged the media to begin asking Clinton about her immigration platform.  “The media needs to begin demanding to hear Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security,” Trump said in his immigration address here Wednesday night. “These are matters of    for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Clinton  …     What we do know, despite the total lack of media curiosity, is that Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. The result will be millions of more illegal immigrants, thousands of more violent crimes, and total chaos and lawlessness. ” Trump said earlier in his interview with Breitbart News that the reason why Clinton cannot do press conferences is because she is running a   campaign devoid of anything but negative attacks on him. “Her speech yesterday was terrible,” Trump told Breitbart News. “All she does is hit Trump and it's not going to work because it's just not going to work. That's all she does is attack Trump. She has no policy. She has no energy. She has nothing. She didn't go to Louisiana —   where she should have gone —   and they're very angry at her, and they should be angry at her. But she didn't go to Louisiana and she didn't go to Mexico. ” He also noted that Clinton didn't go to California to see the drought problems there, which Trump did, and noted that “it's so easy to fix. ” “That is one of the easiest problems in the world to fix,” Trump said. “It's crazy. But she does not have the energy or the stamina to Make America Great Again. ” Trump explained that Clinton's   campaign is part of the reason why Democrats are turning to Trump. “I heard about the Trumpocrats,” Trump said, referring to   lifelong Democrats who plan on voting Republican in November in order to help elect Trump president. “I love that. I love those people  …     It's a big deal,” Trump said, noting that the reason they are turning to him is because “Clinton is the wrong messenger. ” “She can't get the word out,” Trump said. “All she does is attack me. I just left the veterans at the  American Legion and they tell me that she starts attacking me out of nowhere. And they don't want to hear about that. They want to hear about health care and things.

69,30048,48813,Brains Of Holocaust Victims Discovered In Munich Institute,Breitbart,Deborah Danan,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"TEL AVIV  —   Dozens of brains and other body parts were discovered at the Max Planck Psychiatric Institute in Munich, Germany, when the building was undergoing renovations. [The remains of the bodies are reported to have belonged to victims of the Holocaust who were subjected to Nazi experiments, including children, the mentally ill, and the physically disabled, the Max Planck Institute said according to a report by Israel's Army Radio.  The samples were likely used by Nazi brain researcher Julius Hallervorden, who conducted experiments on humans during and after the Nazi era, and even served as the Institute's head of neuropathology in 1938. The Institute, then called the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, often received human body parts from the Nazis, including from the notorious Auschwitz physician Josef Mengele. The findings prompted an investigative committee to be formed in order to review the samples. The committee has begun identifying some of the victims with the eventual goal of burying them in a mass grave, a process that could take years. The Institute published a statement on its website after the discovery. “We are embarrassed by these findings, and the blemish of their discovery in the archives. We will update the public with any further information that comes to light with complete transparency,” the statement said. The Yad Vashem World Center for Holocaust Research was not previously aware of the existence of the remains at the Institute, the report said. “It's surprising, although not completely. We know that experiments were conducted and that not everything was erased and buried. Two years ago, bones of victims on whom experiments were conducted were found in Berlin in the trash. Next year, we're going to organize a convention about this issue,” Professor Dan Machman, Director of the International Center for Holocaust Research at the museum, told Army Radio. “This [discovery] is something new that was previously unknown, and joins other events that are suddenly uncovered after 70 years,” he said. “Whoever thought this chapter was completely finished is mistaken. It's hard to know if these samples are exclusively from ‘mercy killings' [i. e. the murder of sick people for the purposes of experimentation] or if they also derive from other sources,” he added.",False,"TEL AVIV     Dozens of brains and other body parts were discovered at the Max Planck Psychiatric Institute in Munich, Germany, when the building was undergoing renovations.

70,30058,48823,Report: Last-Minute Secret Exceptions Nullified Important Provisions of Iran Nuclear Deal - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Hayward,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"According to a report by the Institute for Science and International Security, a   think tank with a retroactively unfortunate acronym, Obama's nuclear deal with Iran includes even more secret side deals than we thought  —   most, or all, of them favoring Iran. [“The exemptions or loopholes are happening in secret, and it appears that they favor Iran,” said the Institute's president, David Albright, a former weapons inspector for the United Nations.  Reuters listed some of the report's findings, adding that it could not independently verify them, including two exemptions that nullified restrictions on how much   uranium Iran can keep in its nuclear facilities a provision that would allow Iran to continue operating 19 “hot cell” radiation containment chambers and permission for Iran to store 50 tons of heavy water in Oman under its control, instead of selling it, as required by the nuclear deal. The Institute noted that the   uranium could be processed into   material, so the secret side deal makes it effectively impossible to know how much bomb material Iran could produce, on fairly short notice. The hot cells can also be “misused for secret, mostly   plutonium separation efforts,” according to the report. These secret modifications to the deal, which is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) were made by a joint commission staffed by all parties to the deal, including the U. S. and Iran.  One source explained that without the   modifications described in the Institute's report, some of Iran's nuclear facilities would not have been in compliance with the   terms of the JCPOA when sanctions against Iran were lifted in January. That would have been rather embarrassing for the Obama Administration. The White House claims these changes to the JCPOA were not kept secret from Congress, but at least one prominent critic of the nuclear deal, Senator Bob Menendez ( ) who is a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee, told Reuters he was “not aware” of the exemptions, and was never briefed on them.  Albright, who was a   on the report, said the exemptions have been kept secret from the public, and were not disclosed to Congress until after they were granted to Iran. “Since the JCPOA is public, any rationale for keeping these exemptions secret appears unjustified. Moreover, the Joint Commission's secretive decision making process risks advantaging Iran by allowing it to try to systematically weaken the JCPOA.

[Thus, her enemies from Moscow to Benghazi, from London to Manhattan rifle through all her purloined emails, the ones they were not ever supposed to see because she had hidden them, deleted them, destroyed them, even “BleachBitted” them. Indeed, hell hath no fury like a woman on a mission to destroy her yoga emails.  They paint a greasy scene in which the Department of State is transformed into a global shakedown scheme with the ClintonFoundation as the gatekeeper and “favor” maker around the world. It is an international crime syndicate run ruthlessly by the Clinton mafia. Working ceaselessly around the clock in every time zone, the syndicate doles out favors and meetings in exchange for millions of dollars to the ClintonFoundation from anyone, any entity or any government willing to pay.

74,30693,49458,Blue State Blues: The Graph That Explains Trump's Surge - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"When a resurgent Trump invited the families of victims killed by illegal aliens to join him onstage at his immigration speech in Arizona on Wednesday, he outsmarted the networks, like CNN, that had often ignored or cut away from them. [But he was also repaying a debt. Without those families, Trump would have crashed out of the Republican primary race, just as almost everyone expected he would. By listening to them, and amplifying their voices, he connected to a broad constituency and won the nomination.  With their help, he may win the presidency. The proof can be found in an interactive chart at RealClearPolitics, which tracked poll averages during the primary. On July 10, 2015, former Florida governor Jeb Bush was the frontrunner, at 16. 3%. Trump was a distant seventh, with just 6. 5% of the vote. Keep in mind that Trump had been running against illegal immigration since he launched his campaign more than three weeks before, with his infamous remarks about illegal aliens from Mexico. None of that had resonated much. And then, on July 1,    Kate Steinle was shot and killed in San Francisco while strolling along a pier with her father. The murderer, Juan Francisco   had been deported five times before, and had been convicted of seven felonies. He later told a local journalist that he had specifically come to San Francisco because it was a “sanctuary city” that would not cooperate with federal immigration officials or enforce immigration laws. Breitbart News focused on that story in the days that followed. Breitbart California's Michelle Moons, who had covered the protests in Murietta against   illegal alien children who had surged across the Mexican border exactly a year before, wrote a series of articles about Steinle. She used her extensive sources in the law enforcement community, as well as among families who had lost loved ones to crimes by illegal aliens, to build the details of the story and place it in a broader context. That was when Trump began to show an interest in meeting with those families, who had reached out to him in the days after the Steinle murder. He met with them on July 10 in Los Angeles, and the enduring image of that event was of the   Trump standing silently as he listened to the families pouring out their grief.  Few other politicians had ever bothered. These families were inconvenient to a national debate in which the Republicans had already conceded to the opposition. One of the parents who participated, Sabine Durden, later spoke exclusively to Moons: [Trump] listened to each one of our stories and was visibly shaken and touched. We got hugged and he promised to continue to fight for us and our kids. We then went to a separate room where the press was staged. He addressed them and then gave each of us time to share our story. The press tried to pin him down on his previous comments. He stood his ground. I had a Coke bottle that read HERO on it and I told him that he should have it. He is my hero because he was the only one who got attention to this truly important issue. From that moment, Trump took off in the polls, and almost never looked back. From seventh place in the RealClearPolitics average on July 10, Trump shot to first by July 19. His dramatic rise is all the more surprising given that only 7 percent of Americans called immigration the “most important problem” facing the country in a Gallup poll taken over the same period. By listening to the families, and giving them a voice, Trump was no longer speaking of illegal immigration in the abstract, but in a concrete, human way.

Williams, Ph.D.",2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"In his message for the “World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation” Thursday, Pope Francis said that   global warming, as well as a loss of biodiversity are “sins” against God, which must be atoned for by planting trees, avoiding the use of plastic and paper and “separating refuse. ”[“Global warming continues, due in part to human activity,” Francis said, adding that “2015 was the warmest year on record, and 2016 will likely be warmer still. ”  “This is leading to ever more severe droughts, floods, fires and extreme weather events. Climate change is also contributing to the   refugee crisis. The world's poor, though least responsible for climate change, are most vulnerable and already suffering its impact,” he wrote. Repeatedly citing the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, who has “courageously and prophetically continued to point out our sins against creation,” Francis made his own a new list of such environmental sins, which include pollution, global warming and deforestation. For human beings to “destroy the biological diversity of God's creation,” to “degrade the integrity of the earth by causing changes in its climate,” to “contaminate the earth's waters, its land, its air, and its life —  these are sins,” he wrote. Summing up, the Pope stated that “to commit a crime against the natural world is a sin against ourselves and a sin against God. ” Lamenting “the devastation of the environment,” Francis said that “God gave us a bountiful garden, but we have turned it into a polluted wasteland of debris, desolation and filth. ” Specifically regarding a loss of biodiversity, the Pope suggested that now there are fewer species to give glory to God. “We must not be indifferent or resigned to the loss of biodiversity and the destruction of ecosystems, often caused by our irresponsible and selfish behavior,” Francis said. “Because of us, thousands of species will no longer give glory to God by their very existence, nor convey their message to us. We have no such right. ” The Pope said that the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation was instituted in order to give believers an opportunity to “reaffirm their personal vocation to be stewards of creation. ” It also furnishes an occasion to thank God for the gift of creation, to implore his help for its protection and to beg “his pardon for the sins committed against the world in which we live. ” During this Jubilee Year, “let us learn to implore God's mercy for those sins against creation that we have not hitherto acknowledged and confessed,” Francis said, while proposing that Christians need to undergo an “ecological conversion. ” Now is the time to “acknowledge our sins against creation,” the Pope said. “Inasmuch as we all generate small ecological damage,” we are called to acknowledge “our contribution, smaller or greater, to the disfigurement and destruction of creation. ” “Let us repent of the harm we are doing to our common home,” he added. If our ecological conversion is real, Francis said, it will lead to concrete ways of thinking and acting that are more respectful of creation. Among these are “avoiding the use of plastic and paper, reducing water consumption, separating refuse, cooking only what can reasonably be consumed, showing care for other living beings, using public transport or   planting trees, turning off unnecessary lights, or any number of other practices. ” In his message, the Pope also applauded “a growing global political consensus” regarding the environment, praising the adoption of “Sustainable Development Goals” as well as last December's Paris Agreement on climate change, “which set the demanding yet fundamental goal of halting the rise of the global temperature. ” Apparently the pontiff's prayers have already been heard, since scientists are now forecasting that 2017 will be a cooler year than 2016.

79,38514,57362,Dilma Rousseff is out. Now what? ,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) Brazil's problems cannot be solved merely by a change at the top. Even with Dilma Rousseff out as President, the road ahead for Brazil won't be easy. She leaves behind an economy in its second straight year of recession, an unemployment rate of nearly 11% and a   looming statewide corruption scandal that leaves almost no politician unscathed. Here's a deeper look at the major obstacles ahead for the world's ninth largest economy: New president inherits problems Rousseff faced. .. By conservative estimates, new President Michel Temer inherits about $72. 5 billion, or 250 billion Brazilian real, debt, Sen. Waldemir Moka said. As Brazil continues to wade through the longest recession since the 1930s, its once burgeoning middle class is feeling the pinch. More than 11. 6 million people in Brazil are unemployed, or about 11% between April and June. There are signs the market is picking back up since Temer took office in May, but it has a lot of ground to cover.  In the last year, Brazil's economy fell 3. 8% though there are signs the market is picking back up since Temer took office. Brazil's currency has rebounded slightly against the dollar.   Temer and his team of economists have won over Wall Street, but we'll have to see how he juggles spending cuts on pensions and welfare, signature leftist policies from his predecessors. ”This is a moment of hope, to rebuild trust in Brazil. Uncertainty has come to an end. It's time to unify the country,” Temer said after Rousseff's impeachment.

Temer, who was once Rousseff's deputy but is not from her party, was sworn in to finish out her term, through the next general election in 2018. While many Brazilians were in favor of Rousseff's impeachment, they aren't exactly fans of Temer, whose party is also ensnared in corruption charges. According to polls in April, many Brazilians favor a new election altogether and want Temer impeached, too.  In his debut as interim President, he cut his Cabinet down to cut costs but was criticized for ending up with a new leadership team made up entirely of white men. The last time this happened was in 1979, when Brazil was ruled by a military dictatorship. One politician who voted for Rousseff's impeachment called him a ”vampire” and ”virus.” With the world watching, Temer was booed at the Opening Ceremony at the Rio Olympics. Although he has the support of foreign investors, his slim popularity will be challenged as he pushes for austerity and privatization measures to fix the economy.

More than 100 people have been arrested in the last two years, accused of involvement in an estimated $3 billion scheme in which politicians are accused of taking kickbacks from   oil company Petrobras. Rousseff, who once chaired Petrobras, was not personally investigated and has repeatedly denied involvement. She has accused her critics of having done far worse.  Charges against Rousseff's mentor, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, appear to be ramping up. Although he hasn't been officially charged, federal police recommended charging him of accepting kickbacks for lucrative construction contracts.  Members from Temer's Brazilian Democratic Movement party have also been charged in the investigation. In an interview with CNN, he denied wrongdoing but acknowledged that as President, he could face impeachment. ”I am aware that if I do become the President, I, too, could be processed for any political wrongdoing,” he said.

Rousseff can never be President again, but she could give it a run in the lower offices. She left office fighting for her political life until the end, repeatedly calling the trial a coup, and effectively bringing an end to 13 years of the Worker's Party in power.  ”When Brazil or when a President is impeached for a crime that they have not committed,” she said, ”the name we have for this in democracy    it's not an impeachment, it is a coup.”",False," (CNN) Brazil's problems cannot be solved merely by a change at the top.

In the last year, Brazil's economy fell 3. 8% though there are signs the market is picking back up since Temer took office. Brazil's currency has rebounded slightly against the dollar.   Temer and his team of economists have won over Wall Street, but we'll have to see how he juggles spending cuts on pensions and welfare, signature leftist policies from his predecessors. This is a moment of hope, to rebuild trust in Brazil. Uncertainty has come to an end. It's time to unify the country, Temer said after Rousseff's impeachment.

Temer, who was once Rousseff's deputy but is not from her party, was sworn in to finish out her term, through the next general election in 2018. While many Brazilians were in favor of Rousseff's impeachment, they aren't exactly fans of Temer, whose party is also ensnared in corruption charges. According to polls in April, many Brazilians favor a new election altogether and want Temer impeached, too.  In his debut as interim President, he cut his Cabinet down to cut costs but was criticized for ending up with a new leadership team made up entirely of white men. The last time this happened was in 1979, when Brazil was ruled by a military dictatorship. One politician who voted for Rousseff's impeachment called him a vampire and virus. With the world watching, Temer was booed at the Opening Ceremony at the Rio Olympics. Although he has the support of foreign investors, his slim popularity will be challenged as he pushes for austerity and privatization measures to fix the economy.

More than 100 people have been arrested in the last two years, accused of involvement in an estimated $3 billion scheme in which politicians are accused of taking kickbacks from   oil company Petrobras. Rousseff, who once chaired Petrobras, was not personally investigated and has repeatedly denied involvement. She has accused her critics of having done far worse.  Charges against Rousseff's mentor, former President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, appear to be ramping up. Although he hasn't been officially charged, federal police recommended charging him of accepting kickbacks for lucrative construction contracts.  Members from Temer's Brazilian Democratic Movement party have also been charged in the investigation. In an interview with CNN, he denied wrongdoing but acknowledged that as President, he could face impeachment. I am aware that if I do become the President, I, too, could be processed for any political wrongdoing, he said.  Read more: What's Petrobras and 'Operation Car Wash'?  What's next for Rousseff? Although lawmakers convicted Rousseff of corruption, they failed to pass a motion banning her from political office. Rousseff can never be President again, but she could give it a run in the lower offices. She left office fighting for her political life until the end, repeatedly calling the trial a coup, and effectively bringing an end to 13 years of the Worker's Party in power.  When Brazil or when a President is impeached for a crime that they have not committed, she said, the name we have for this in democracy    it's not an impeachment, it is a coup."

In public, Trump and Peña Nieto mostly struck a friendly tone, though acrimony later broke out over whether the pair had discussed Mexican payment for a   border wall, a trademark Trump policy. ”I was also very clear in my conversation with Trump on the border: Mexico will not pay for any wall,” Peña Nieto wrote. Trump has disputed Peña Nieto's account, and in his speech on Wednesday he declared, ”Mexico will pay for the wall. 100%.

82,38518,57366,"Peña Nieto, you got 'punked' ",CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) In a delirious attempt to divert attention from the fact that he is perhaps the most unpopular President in the history of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto invited Republican presidential nominee Trump to visit him at Los Pinos.  Sure, changing the subject must have seemed like a good idea. After all, the Reforma newspaper has just released a poll showing the President with a dismal 23% approval rating, just a few weeks before presenting the state of the union address to Congress. Meanwhile, his administration continues to be rocked by corruption allegations, a troubled economy and even accusations that he plagiarized his college thesis.  But what has just occurred was a fiasco. Naturally, Peña Nieto also sent an invitation to Democratic nominee Clinton. But that's probably because he never really thought anyone would actually come.  It's a cultural thing in Mexico    you run into a business contact or an acquaintance you haven't seen since that party where you totally made a fool of yourself, and you say you'll meet for coffee. But there's a certain etiquette to these things south of the border. Deep down, you both know you're not really supposed to actually make a plan to meet. It's   Mexican diplomacy, the kind of understanding that runs far and wide across this country of 120 million. Clearly, though, Peña Nieto doesn't get the Trump campaign, and nor do any of his trusted advisers. This despite the fact that Trump has made it his campaign modus operandi to blow up protocols, media outlets and political correctness alike. He is the   candidate. It's what got him the Republicans nomination. As a result, in less than 24 hours, Peña Nieto had backed himself into a corner Trump was on his way. Mexicans were out on the street protesting, social media was abuzz, #TrumpNoEresBienvenido (#TrumpYouAreNotWelcome) was trending on Twitter, and Mexico's President was now hosting a state visit with perhaps the   hated man in the entire country. It couldn't get any worse, but somehow did. Peña Nieto held a joint press conference standing    with a man he previously likened to Adolf Hitler. The Mexican President's speech was gracious, and he said he would work with whomever won November's election. The thing is, Trump isn't the leader of the free world, so you can't expect to play a suave game of hardball with the former host of ”The Apprentice” the way Obama has with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  As a result, Trump got the photo op he wanted, standing there looking presidential in an attempt to bolster his credentials as a potential world leader to anyone still on the fence. And then he opened his mouth and confirmed what Mexicans feared would happen all along: He talked about the wall. To a captive audience in Mexico and the USA, Trump said, ”We did discuss the wall. We didn't discuss payment of the wall. That'll be for a later date.” Peña, te hiciste güey. Peña Nieto just stood there. And even though millions of Mexicans were seething with anger and indignation, their President didn't respond to a comment by a man who has   riled up millions of American voters against Mexico since, oh, about three minutes into his campaign.  True, many Mexicans see Peña Nieto as incompetent and even corrupt. But what Trump said was worse than any of that. So at the very least, Mexicans expected Peña Nieto to reprimand his guest. But it didn't happen. And, as expected, Trump returned triumphantly to Arizona to present a much awaited immigration plan on Wednesday night    and also got to brag about how he had spoken to the Mexican President himself. We all watched, flabbergasted. And were reminded why Peña Nieto is these days as despised in Mexico as Trump. So the neta, or awful truth as we say in Mexico, is not that Enrique Peña Nieto got ”punked” by a Republican nominee (although he did). And it's not even just that Trump could become the commander in chief come January 2017. No, the really sad truth is that this could be what a bilateral conference between these two neighbors looks like in future. Perhaps the most depressing part of all this is that it demonstrates that Americans are far too enthralled by reality TV, in much the same way that Mexicans love their telenovelas. This is despite the fact that these two important nations jointly face genuine challenges such as over the economy, drug and human trafficking and security issues on both sides of the   border.

Other states declare emergencies, Farther north, Georgia Gov Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 56 counties in his state, parts of which are expected to get up to 10 inches of rain over the weekend. We are working to ensure counties in south, central and coastal Georgia have access to the state resources necessary to prepare when . .. Hermine enters Georgia, Deal said Thursday. North Carolina Gov Pat McCrory issued a state of emergency for 33 eastern counties. The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for the   coast and New Jersey, extending to Sandy Hook, New Jersey.

84,38521,57369,Trump doctor to CNN: No regrets about letter,CNN,Drew Griffin,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) Trump's doctor told CNN in an interview he stands by the letter he wrote for the Republican nominee vouching for his good health and has no regrets about being embroiled in the controversy over it. When asked if Trump has the physically capability of being president, Dr. Harold Bornstein told CNN's Drew Griffin on Thursday, ”Absolutely, no question about it.” Bornstein, a    NY City gastroenterologist, has been Trump's physician for more than three decades and came under scrutiny for an unusual letter he wrote in 2015 describing Trump's physical health, which other doctors have said includes strange wording, medically incorrect terms and an unprofessional conclusion. Trump's lab ”test results were astonishingly excellent,” he wrote, mimicking the grandiose verbiage of his  . ”If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Bornstein told CNN that he was rushed for time when writing the letter since he had patients to see.  ”The only thing I wanted to do in my life is practice with my father, which I managed to do for 35 years.”   RELATED: Trump's doctor: Trump 'will be healthiest individual ever elected' president, Bornstein told CNN that his father started his medical practice at the same Park Avenue office location in 1947.  Trump was first under the care of his father Dr. Jacob Bornstein, according to the letter. Harold Bornstein joined the practice in 1980, and when his father passed away in 2010, continued it. When asked if he had any regrets about getting involved in the presidential election, Bornstein said, ”No. My patients, I take care of them the right way.” The CNN interview was cut short when Dr. Bornstein's wife approached, and covered the camera with her hand. Bornstein had warned it might happen. ”My wife will come back, she'll get angry,” he said as the interview began. At least four medical malpractice lawsuits have been filed against Dr. Harold Bornstein in the state of NY dating back to 1986. In a 1999 lawsuit, NY resident Kenneth Levin accused Bornstein of negligence in failing to properly diagnose and treat his wife by ”overmedicating” her with prescription drugs and not following proper medical procedures, which Levin argued led to her death. The case argues Bornstein ”prescribed unnecessary barbiturates and other drugs to the decedent with full knowledge that these medications were not necessary” and that some were ”greatly in excess of appropriate dosages.” RELATED: Clinton's health is fine, but what about Trump? Bornstein denied the allegations and settled the case in 2002 for $86, 000 with no finding of liability. Another case charged both Bornstein and his father of recklessness in overdosing and improperly performing a colonoscopy on Vincent Pollifrone, which the case argued led to his death in 2000. The case was disposed in 2006, after the defendants denied the claims. The plaintiff's lawyer in that case, Joseph Miklos, told CNN the parties signed a confidentiality agreement so he could not discuss the terms of any settlement. When asked about the lawsuits Thursday, Bornstein defended his credentials and said the number of malpractice suits he has faced is ”normal.” Professor David Studdert of Stanford University, an expert on health law who has tracked data on medical malpractice lawsuits, said gastroenterologists such as Bornstein have about a 10% chance of facing a new medical malpractice suit each year. ”Over a career, it would be the norm rather than the exception that a gastroenterologist would have a few claims filed against him. That's not an outlier situation,” Studdert said. Dr. G Kevin Donovan, a bioethicist at Georgetown University Medical School, agrees that the existence of four disposed malpractice suits does not provide enough information to draw conclusions about Bornstein, but he said Bornstein's letter describing Trump's health is light on detail and heavy on bombast. RELATED: Trump's health care plan: What he promises and what it really says  Donovan said most physicians ”don't use that kind of hyperbole for a medical statement.” Donovan added that most letters written by doctors for presidential candidates contain a level of subjectivity since candidates select the doctors who write their assessments and can stipulate what information they include. ”They can only tell us what the candidate allows them to reveal,” Donovan said, adding, ”Is it likely that a candidate would go to a physician that would not speak well of them?” Former patients and a classmate of Bornstein reached by CNN described him as competent yet eccentric. NY resident Roger Friedman, who said he was a patient of Bornstein's in the 80's and early 90's, said he was surprised when he recently heard Bornstein had treated Trump for decades. ”He was a good doctor but he was peculiar, disorganized, and not at the level you expect for a billionaire,” Friedman said.  Angelina Kaiserman, a NY jeweler who told CNN she has been in Bornstein's care for more than 20 years, said, ”Honestly I give him five stars.” Dr. Edward Hurwitz, who attended medical school with Bornstein at Tufts University in the class of 1975, remembers Bornstein making sarcastic comments in class and often writing elaborate poems with colorful language he would share with friends. ”He was snide with his comments but he was certainly smart,” Hurwitz said.",False," (CNN) Trump's doctor told CNN in an interview he stands by the letter he wrote for the Republican nominee vouching for his good health and has no regrets about being embroiled in the controversy over it.

85,38524,57372,Zika spraying kills millions of honeybees,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) The pictures are heartbreaking: Millions of honeybees lie dead after being sprayed with an insecticide targeting   mosquitoes.  ”On Saturday, it was total energy, millions of bees foraging, pollinating, making honey for winter,” beekeeper Juanita Stanley said. ”Today, it stinks of death. Maggots and other insects are feeding on the honey and the baby bees who are still in the hives. It's heartbreaking.” Stanley,   of Flowertown Bee Farm and Supply in Summerville, South Carolina, said she lost 46 beehives    more than 3 million bees    in mere minutes after the spraying began Sunday morning. ”Those that didn't die immediately were poisoned trying to drag out the dead,” Stanley said. ”Now, I'm going to have to destroy my hives, the honey, all my equipment. It's all contaminated.” Stanley said Summerville Fire Capt. Andrew Macke, who keeps bees as a hobby, also lost thousands of bees. She said neither of them had protected their hives because they didn't know about the aerial spraying.  ”Andrew has two hives,” Stanley said. ”He didn't know they were going to spray. His wife called him. His bees are at their porch right by their home, and she saw dead bees everywhere.” It's a tragedy that could be repeated across the country as cases of Zika continue to rise and local mosquito control districts struggle to protect their residents and ease local fears. The spray fell from the skies between 6:30 and 8:30 a. m. Sunday. It was the first aerial spraying in 14 years, according to Dorchester County Administrator Jason Ward, part of the county's efforts to combat Zika after four local residents were diagnosed with the virus.  ”We chose Sunday morning because few people would be out and about that early on a weekend,” Ward said. ”To protect the bees, you don't want to spray after the sun has been up more two hours, so we scheduled it early.” The county used a product called Trumpet, which contains the pesticide naled, recommended by the EPA and the CDC for control of adult Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that transmits Zika.  According to the manufacturer's label (PDF) Trumpet is ”highly toxic to bees exposed to direct treatment on blooming crops or weeds. To minimize hazard to bees, it is recommended that the product is not applied more than two hours after sunrise or two hours before sunset, limiting application to times when bees are least active.” ”We followed that recommendation,” said Ward, ”which is also the policy laid out by the state, using a pesticide the state has approved for use.” Ward says the county also notified residents of the spraying by posting a notice on its website at 9 a. m. Friday, two days before the spraying. He added that it alerted beekeepers who were on the local mosquito control registry by phone or email, a common practice before truck spraying. ”That's true when they sprayed by trucks they told me in advance, and we talked about it so I could protect my bees,” Stanley said. ”But nobody called me about the aerial spraying nobody told me at all.”  Stanley said she ”would have been screaming and pleading on their doorstep if they had.” ” 'Do it at night when bees are done foraging,' I would have told them,” she added, breaking into tears. ”But they sprayed at 8 a. m. Sunday, and all of my bees were out, doing their work by then.”  Macke was also not informed, Ward said, because he, like many hobby beekeepers, is not on the local mosquito control registry.  ”We are obviously saddened by the fact people have lost their hives, and we have gone back and looked at our procedures,” Ward said. ”We will now give up to five days of advance notice, and we have expanded our list to include more local beekeepers.” Stanley says she doesn't think there was malice involved, but that doesn't make the loss of her ”honey girls” any less painful. ”This wasn't about the honey,” she said. ”It was about raising bees and selling them to other people, and spreading the honey girls out there into the world.

86,38525,57373,Report: Iran granted exemptions to nuclear accord,CNN,Elise Labott,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Washington (CNN) The US and other members of the international community granted Iran exemptions to its requirements under the agreement that sought to curb its nuclear program, according to a new report by the   Institute for Science and International Security. The alleged granting of ”secret” exemptions to Iran by the Joint Commission, the deal's implementing body, is likely to thrust the controversial accord, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) back into the political spotlight.  The report says ”most of the conditions” laid out in the agreement ”were met by Iran” but it also claims Iran would have not been in compliance by January 16, 2016, the deal's   Implementation Day, without the exemptions to the requirement that Iran limit its stockpile of low enriched uranium to under  . The exemptions supposedly pertained to uranium in ”waste form,” according to the report, but the authors noted that that waste was potentially recoverable.  The report's authors, David Albright and Andrea Stricker, went on to blast Obama's administration for keeping these exemptions secret.   ”Any rationale for keeping these exemptions secret appears unjustified,” the report said. Albright told CNN that the additional low enriched uranium could reduce the amount of time needed for Iran to develop a nuclear bomb if it decided to break the accord.   The report said another exemption allowed Iran to operate 19 ”hot cells” larger than specified in the accords, larger hot cells could be used to produce plutonium, which can also be used to produce a nuclear weapon.  ”We were also worried that these exemptions or decisions by the Joint Commission set bad precedents that Iran is going to use to try and further weaken the conditions of the Iran deal,” added Albright, a physicist and expert on Iran's nuclear program. The report's conclusions were first published by Reuters.  The State Department pushed back Thursday on the report's findings but noted that the workings of the Joint Commission were always confidential and therefore declined to discuss specifics of the commission's work. ”The Joint Commission has not and will not loosen any of the commitments and has not provided any exceptions that would allow Iran to retain or process material In excess of its (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) limits that it could use in a breakout scenario,” State Department spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. ”There's been no cutting of slack,” he added.  The White House also criticized the report Thursday, with spokesman Josh Earnest saying the administration had ”significant objections” to it. ”Iran is in compliance with the agreement. That's not my opinion. That's not rhetoric. That is not a conjecture. That is a fact that is verified by independent international experts who, because of the agreement, now have the kind of access that is required to verify it,” Earnest said. Kirby said that the International Atomic Energy Agency had also confirmed that Iran was fulfilling its obligations under the deal, noting that Iran's ”breakout” period for obtaining a nuclear weapon had been extended from several months to a year as a result of the deal. A senior State Department official offered an even more strident rebuttal, telling CNN, ”The USA and its partners did not and will not allow Iran to skirt its JCPOA commitments.” The official said that Iran met all of its commitments on implementation day and that ”Any assertion to the contrary is completely false.” ”Iran has never been over its 300 kilogram limit for low enriched uranium,” the official added.

For months, opposition parties have been pushing for the government to hold a referendum on Maduro's presidency. Many Venezuelans have lost patience with the socialist president amid widespread shortages of food and medical supplies, surging crime levels, rolling blackouts and massive inflation. Experts predict Venezuela's economy will shrink by 10% this year, while inflation will rise by 700%.  Venezuelan officials say they aren't to blame for the country's mounting problems they accuse the political right of carrying out an economic war to undermine the government.

88,38528,57376,Polaris recalls two off-road models due to fire hazard,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) A fire hazard has prompted Polaris Industries Inc. to recall two models of recreational   vehicles, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday. The engine can overheat, and the turbo system's drain tube can loosen, possibly causing a fire.  The   company said it received 19 reports of the ROVs catching fire, resulting in six burn injuries. One of the fires, occurring in Utah's American Fork Canyon, caused severe burns on a young child and destroyed 15 acres of forest land, the commission reported. People should immediately stop using the ROVs and contact Polaris to schedule a free repair. All   2016 Polaris RZR XP Turbo and RZR XP 4 Turbo ROVs need to be returned. Vehicles were purchased at dealers nationwide between August 2015 and July 2016.  The recall includes nearly 13, 000 vehicles, including 2, 230 ROVs recalled in December. ”Polaris” is stamped onto the front grille of the ROVs, sold in blue, gray, orange and red. ”RZR” is printed on the rear box or on the right and left rear fenders and ”Turbo” on the hood or on the right and left front fenders. At least 900 deaths over a   period were related to   vehicles or ATVs being ridden on paved roads or parking lots, according to the safety commission. During the same period, nearly 3, 000 deaths and 490, 000 injuries related to ATVs and ROVs were reported. Overturning is a common risk when driving an   vehicle on a paved surface, since ATVs and ROVs are designed for   terrains. These vehicles are also more likely to collide with cars, trucks and other vehicles, said the commission. In advance of the holiday weekend, the agency reminded the public that riders need to wear helmets and protective gear, including boots, gloves, eye protectors, long pants and   shirts, and seat belts must be used. Most ATVs are designed for one rider passengers should never exceed seats.

Organizers used the roof    build at a cost of $150 million    for the first time in tournament history in Wednesday's night session but it proved especially beneficial Thursday after rain hit NY in the morning and afternoon.  In years past, the precipitation would have meant no play at all at the year's final major, prompting reruns    for TV viewers    of old matches. However, cover over Arthur Ashe stadium ensured the action wasn't significantly disrupted on the biggest regularly used tennis court in the world.  Play on outer courts was, mind you, severely affected.  Andy Murray usually plays on center court wherever he goes and the Scot was no doubt thrilled to be given a slot on Arthur Ashe stadium given the gloomy forecast.  Murray has appeared in the three previous grand slam finals this season    winning Wimbledon in July    and is the most   player in tennis, having also won singles gold at the Olympics last month. This while world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, affected by wrist and arm injuries, has cooled. Murray progressed to the third round by beating Marcel Granollers       in a competitive 2   hour contest that featured extended rallies and more than a few drop shots from the Spaniard.  Murray    who won the U. S. Open in 2012 after claiming the junior title in 2004    enjoyed his time under the roof although it took the second seed a while to get used to the rain pelting down on the roof.  ”I didn't know what it was at the beginning,” Murray told Eurosport. ”Neither of us did and then obviously when (we) realized it was the rain there's nothing you can do about that. It's so loud. I've never played like that before. ”You can't hear the ball. Tennis players do pick up the sound of the ball to read the spins a little bit earlier and the speed of the serve, so it makes it tricky.  ”It's something that you need to adjust to and get used to. After a few games it was okay but at the start it's tricky.” Simona Halep began play on Ashe and in another entertaining tussle, defeated fellow French Open finalist Lucie Safarova    .  ”I had a nice feeling,” Halep told reporters. ”It was a great experience to be there. I didn't have to wait for the rain, so that's a good thing.” Halep is considered one of only a sprinkling of players able to challenge Serena Williams for the women's title, with the list dwindling after Garbine Muguruza    who beat Williams in the French Open final    was upset Wednesday. The Romanian is   in her last 21 matches.  Could Venus Williams win a first major in eight years? There's still plenty of tennis to be played in NY but the    remains in contention after easing past Germany's Julia Goerges     to end the day session on Ashe.

92,38532,57380,What a Trump win would mean for LGBT equality,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) Recently, ISIS pushed four men off a building in Mosul because they were suspected of being gay. Last month, the Ugandan government detained citizens attending a pride parade and ordered them beaten by other inmates. In Bangladesh, the editor of the nation's only LGBTQ magazine was recently found hacked to death. As we consider what the 2016 election will mean for LGBTQ equality across the USA, we also can't forget what this election will mean for our global community. Trump has spent his campaign threatening to undo crucial protections for LGBTQ people in the USA, vowing to appoint judges to the Supreme Court to turn back the legalization of   marriage and supporting   discrimination against transgender people. He has courted extremists who foment hate both here and export it abroad.  His running mate, Pence, as a congressman in 2009, opposed language in federal legislation to monitor and combat human rights violations against LGBTQ people abroad, accusing Democrats of attempting to ”promote a gay rights agenda around the globe.”  Trump has also sought support from leading exporters of   hate, including the Alliance Defending Freedom. Well known for the work it does within US borders, ADF is also spreading hate in countries around the world, from fighting equality in Russia to recruiting and training   activists in Nepal. Together, Trump and Pence seem to have little interest in    and perhaps little understanding of    the dire plight faced by asylum seekers, including those who seek to flee the violence of ISIS or escape the   regime in Russia.  And yet, Trump says he's a friend to the LGBTQ community. But let's look at what he would actually do. Recently, Trump proposed an ideology test on new immigrants that would require those coming into the USA to show they are, among other things, tolerant of LGBTQ people. Putting aside the fact that he and Pence would apparently fail their own ideology test on several fronts, the very existence of such a vetting policy would create another obstacle for refugees  —  including LGBTQ people fleeing countries where they can literally be put to death simply because of who they are. By contrast, today    thanks to the work of Clinton as secretary of state, and others    LGBTQ people can receive priority resettlement because they face a significant threat of violence, torture, and even death in the countries they are leaving. The policy also prioritizes other vulnerable groups such as children, widows and older refugees, as well as targeted communities like religious and ethnic minorities. While Trump was busy cozying up to Vladimir Putin back in 2011, Clinton was declaring before the international community that ”gay rights are human rights.” She was creating the Global Equality Fund, which supports human rights defenders working to protect LGBTQ people in more than 80 countries. She was also helping ensure the United Nations Human Rights Council passed its very first resolution on sexual orientation and gender identity in 2011.  In Clinton, the LGBTQ community has a leader who was not only willing to make historic commitments through our foreign policy, but has taken action. Trump and Pence pose a clear threat to equality here in the USA, particularly when it comes to marriage equality, basic civil rights protections and the makeup of our Supreme Court. But let's also consider what's on the line for the gay teen living in Jamaica or the transgender woman living in Honduras or the men living in daily fear of being exposed, targeted and murdered by ISIS. For them, our foreign policy can mean life or death. In a   administration, does anyone think human rights for all will remain a pillar of our foreign policy? Or that our embassies abroad will provide the same beacon of hope to local LGBTQ communities? Or that whomever Trump selects as his secretary of state or UN ambassador will go before the international community to fight against discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity?  Would Trump stand up against hateful legislation in countries like Russia and Uganda when he's endorsed the ability of US states to legalize discrimination? The answers to all of those questions are: clearly not. This election is about many crucial issues of great importance here at home.

We're attending a screening at the 27th annual Honolulu Rainbow Film Festival, and midway through a QA session with the cast of tonight's documentary the mood turns dark, more like ”Friday Night Fights.” The circle of security guards tightens, just in case. People in the front rows get ready to duck. Some stand and approach the stage. Are these two dudes, a yoga teacher and a hairdresser by trade, really about to start swinging? What in the name of holy hell is going on? ”Holy Hell,” in fact, is the reason everyone is packed into the Doris Duke Theatre at the Honolulu Museum of Art on a steamy Friday night in August. It's the name of Will Allen's documentary, backed by Academy      Jared Leto, and it tells the story of how Allen and his friends spent more than two decades in a New   spiritual group they called the Buddhafield.  In his search for enlightenment, Allen followed an eccentric,   guru from West Hollywood to Austin, Texas, and then to Hawaii's Lanikai Beach, about a   drive from this theater. One night about 10 years ago, he simply left the guru behind, here in Hawaii.  He walked away in the wake of allegations that the guru had been sexually abusing young male followers for years. Allen says he was one of them. In the decade since, Allen and his Buddhafield friends have moved on, but a new group has grown up in their place. So Allen has come back to Hawaii to lay his film at the feet of his former guru. He sees ”Holy Hell” as a cautionary tale, and wants people here to know what happened to him and his friends    so it won't happen to them.  That's why fear and loathing are sweeping the yoga studios of Oahu, and why death threats are being reported to police. It's why people are eyeing each other at the Whole Foods store in the Kailua Town Center and wondering, ”Are you in that cult?”  And it's why Murti Hower and Jentry Petzold look like they're about to throttle each other up on stage.  The two men met in Austin and say they love each other like brothers. But there's one big difference between them: Hower, one of the original Buddhafield recruiters featured in the film, no longer follows the teacher. As for Petzold, well, all he'll say is his relationship with the teacher is far more cordial.  Petzold and another emissary, Martin Doluz, insist they aren't in a cult, and that their guru isn't brainwashing or sexually abusing anybody. The both say they owe him everything. The loose collection of followers, many tied into Oahu's yoga and   communities, isn't organized enough to qualify as a ”group,” they insist.  It doesn't even have a name.  But the others on stage    director Allen and some who appear in the film, Hower, Chris Johnston, Julian Goldstein, Radhia Gleis and Alessandra Burenin    all say they were brainwashed and manipulated. Looking back, they have no doubt that the Buddhafield was a cult.  Along the way, they say, they lost their spiritual innocence, their identities and even their ability to make decisions for themselves.  Now they say they're hearing disturbing things from friends on the island, that the master they knew as Andreas is not laying low, as he'd promised them he would. He's collecting new acolytes and calling himself ”Reyji.” It means ” .”  Concerned neighbors say he has taken to walking the streets of Lanikai in disguise    with a cane and wearing a white surgical mask. But Doluz insists that's another spiritual leader who has taken up residence on the island with a band of followers.  But, just before the film festival, Andreas moved to a bigger, more secure home nearby. Alllen's spies are calling this compound ”The Fortress.”  Those close to Reyji see the filmmaker's actions as an aggression. This impression is underscored when a mass mailing marketing the film hits every mailbox within a   radius of Lanikai Beach.  ”The film he doesn't want you to see,” says one side of a postcard announcing that ”Holy Hell” is available on iTunes, Amazon and soon will be on Netflix. (The documentary also airs on CNN at 9 p. m. Thursday.)  Hower, meanwhile, says he's being harassed, more so now that the film is being shown on the island he calls home. He's afraid of what will happen when everybody else goes home. The   fireworks with Petzold blow over. Still, tensions run high in the community as ”Holy Hell” is unleashed on the unsuspecting island of Oahu. From Will to Francesco  I meet Will Allen for the first time at the Novel Café in Santa Monica, California, not far from his place. It's the type of neighborhood where people who are into meditation, yoga and kale feel right at home.  A quick breakfast turns into a   talkathon. He seems funny and sweet, and there is a boyish innocence about him. I wonder if that's what happens when you go a couple of decades without carrying the responsibilities of kids and a   day job.  Allen is 53 now, with flecks of gray in his tousled mop of hair, but he spent the years 22 to 44 inside the Buddhafield. He was just out of college, a bit adrift, when a sister introduced him to the group in West Hollywood. He says he was a prime recruit, and vulnerable. He'd just come out as gay, and his mother hadn't taken it as well as he'd hoped. In fact, he says, she kicked him out of the family home in an upscale neighborhood in Southern California. At 22, Allen didn't know if he wanted to be a filmmaker, although it had been his dream for as long as he could remember. Now, three decades later, he is one.  And, as the Buddhafield's official videographer, he's sitting on what might be the largest collection of tapes showing life inside a   cult.  Make no mistake: Life inside the Buddhafield did take on some of the widely accepted hallmarks of a cult. Members' egos and identities were stripped away. Most followers didn't get to keep the names they came with they were assigned new ones. The group's focus shifted subtly over the years instead of delving into themselves for enlightenment, members of the Buddhafield were encouraged to worship their guru. One acolyte, Julian Goldstein, showed his devotion by carving elaborate fruit salads his masterpiece was the Last Supper.  Will's name was changed to Francesco. One day in Hawaii, before his film is screened, I shoot him a text about all the events he's juggling, noting that it can't be easy to be Will Allen. He responds, ”It wasn't easy being Francesco, either.”  The Buddhafield had caught the attention of   Rick Ross by the early 1990s. So the guru simply packed up and left in the middle of the night, checking out the legendary vortexes of Sedona, Arizona, before ultimately relocating in Austin. Radhia Gleis, a former member, says she supplied the down payment for a sprawling ranch house on enough acreage to accommodate koi ponds and an aviary.  The guru, who had been going by ”Michel,” changed his own name to ”Andreas.” It's the name most followers know him by, although more recent acolytes occasionally let a ”Reyji” slip out.  Even people who have known him for more than 25 years are sketchy on the details, but they say he was born Jaime Gomez, the son of a wealthy Venezuelan rancher. He came to the USA in search of Hollywood stardom and legally changed his name to Michel Rostand.  His claim to fame, they say, was a nonspeaking role in a party scene in the Roman Polanski classic ”Rosemary's Baby.” He boasted of having danced with the Oakland Ballet. And former followers say he apparently starred in some gay adult films as well, but they were initially unaware of his porn career.  Many of his followers met the guru at weekly yoga and meditation sessions.  He led them on weekend outings to rivers and mountaintops and rocky beaches, where they frolicked, shed their   meditated and got in touch with their inner children.  The highlight of these sessions was an exercise they called shakti, a transfer of energy between master and student. At its most intense, a student experiences shakti as something akin to an LSD trip with flashing lights and vibrant colors    and an overwhelming sense of bliss.  And then there was ”The Knowing,” no less than making a direct connection with God. It wasn't given to all, but it's what kept people coming back.  It was all too beautiful. Until, they say, it wasn't. Boundaries, Will Allen says ”Holy Hell” merely tells his personal story    what happened to him, and to some of his friends during their years inside the Buddhafield. His story is intimate but  .  He is not an angry narrator he stands back a bit from his own misadventure, gently wondering: How could this happen?  That soft tone, along with hours and hours of insider footage, provide an alluring yet deeply disturbing view of life inside a cult.  But Allen has never been satisfied with the closing scenes of his movie. They depict a trip to Oahu, and a surreptitiously videotaped encounter with the guru on a public beach. It isn't much of a confrontation, instead playing out like an awkward chance meeting with an ex.  ”Are you being a good boy?” Allen asks, and the guru pushes back, saying he is less concerned with ”good” and more interested in what is ”best.” ”Are you being your best boy?” Allen persists, and the guru just smiles cryptically and says, ”I'm just being.”  That was at the outset of Allen's   film project. A lot has happened since then. Allen says he cried every day he worked on ”Holy Hell.”  Hawaii is stirring up some emotions. It's the place Allen says the guru first initiated sex with him. And, years later, it was the place where he finally decided to leave the Buddhafield afer 22 years. Still, he doesn't hesitate when I ask him to help me find Reyji    or people who know him    so I can hear another side of the story. Allen agrees, partly because he's a nice, helpful guy. Perhaps, there's an even more powerful motivator for a filmmaker: curiosity.  We drive the Lanikai Beach neighborhood, up narrow residential streets that wind into the hills from the beach. Allen rides shotgun and navigates, with some   help from Chris Johnston, who appears in the film. We find the house where Allen filmed Reyji before, and neighbors say he's been there until very recently. The yard is overgrown, and a tall fence is posted with ”No Trespassing” signs. Although Reyji must be well into his 70s by now, neighbors report that the guru still strolls down the street in his Speedo.  We are trying to figure out the best way to approach people who are friendly with Reyji when Allen spots somebody he recognizes behind the wheel of a pickup. We turn around and follow the truck up the hill. It comes to rest at a carport in front of a hillside home with a killer view.  We chat for a bit with Alan, who won't give his last name and says he is no longer with the group.  As he speaks, Alan stares into the distance with the bluest eyes I've ever seen. His pupils are tiny, his squint unwavering. This won't be the last intense,   stare I'll witness over the weekend.   A young woman with long, strawberry blond hair arrives and immediately lights into Will Allen. How dare he? How dare he film her and use her image without permission?  They get into an animated conversation it turns out that she can be seen in the crowd in one of the final scenes. Allen points out that she was filmed in public, and that to most viewers she's just a passing face in the crowd.  She accuses him of ”diminishing” her and once again they start arguing. This time, she lashes out: ”You're interrupting. That's the fourth time you've interrupted me.”  And, speaking of boundaries . .. ”Aren't you on my property?” Allen says he'd been invited up to talk with Alan, who hadn't objected when I tagged along. Still, we take it as our cue to go.  I leave them with my contact information I'm very interested, I assure them, in their point of view.  That night, at the first showing of the film, I encounter Petzold, there to represent Team Reyji. He promises to relay a message to the teacher. We decide to scale back our guru hunt and let things play out. No point in spooking him.  Reyji has seen the film, and it saddens him, say those professing to be close to him. While dealing with Petzold, I hear from Martin Doluz. He is a yoga teacher who describes himself as a ”good friend” in daily,    contact with the guru.  The first half of the movie showed an experience similar to his own, he said. ”Beautiful.” But not the second half of the movie. That was nothing like his experience. And, like the blond woman in the driveway, he didn't appreciate being shown without his permission in a film about a cult.  Doluz suggests I might actually get to meet the guru. But, by the end of a lengthy conversation that includes some deep   on Doluz's part, I am advised not to change my travel plans. Instead, a couple of days later Doluz and Petzold each pass along an emailed statement from ”Michel.”   ”It is heartbreaking to see how history has been rewritten,” the statement begins. ” 'Holy Hell' is not a documentary, rather, it is a work of fiction designed to create drama, fear and persecution, knowing that is what sells.” The statement continues, with a personal appeal to his former followers:  ”I am saddened by this attempt to obscure the message of universal love and spiritual awakening. It is devastating to see these friends, who were once so filled with love for the world, become so angry. I wish them only the best, and hold each one close to my heart. If any of my actions were a catalyst for their disharmony, I am truly sorry.” And he ends with a wish: ”May all beings find peace.” Supporters of the guru argue that he's harmless. Petzold says the former members featured in ”Holy Hell” seem to suffer from ”a bad case of buyer's remorse.”  Any sexual contact, the guru's supporters say, was consensual and came within the context of   relationships. It isn't happening now, they insist. Doluz says that ”even if that should be offered,” a disciple can always turn down a sexual advance.  Allen and his friends, Goldstein and Johnston, argue that they were never interested in their guru sexually. They all were much younger than   when they say he groomed them and turned them into his concubines. He was a creature of habit, and they say he reserved a day for each of them: Allen was Thursdays, Goldstein was Tuesdays and Saturdays, and Johnston, who is straight, always drew Mondays. They had been taught to bow in submission as a way to connect with God. That was how their guru groomed them, they say.    But submission should never be confused with consent, they insist. How can you consent to sex with somebody who has power over you, who holds the key to your spiritual enlightenment?  ”How can you equate that to consent when the imbalance of power is so great?” Johnston asks.  It is an argument similar to those made by survivors of clergy abuse scandals. Something else he says in the film seems to resonate with audiences, no matter whether they're at Sundance, or in Austin, Los Angeles or Honolulu. Cults are everywhere, Johnston states. ”I guarantee you there's a cult right here in your town.”  The toll the Buddhafield took can be counted in years lost, relationships abandoned, opportunities missed.  ”My 20s? Gone!” says Johnston, who was known as ”Ricky” and was said to be one of the guru's favorites. ”My 30s    gone!”  ”My 40s    gone!” So rues another follower, Vera Chieffo. ”My 50s    gone!” Radhia Gleis picks up the count. An accomplished equestrienne, she gave up her career to follow the guru and eventually rose to become one of his top aides. She regrets not having children. In trying to find enlightenment, they lost themselves and the best years of their lives.  Welcome to the 'Bootyfield'  Sitting through two showings of ”Holy Hell,” it's easy to understand how anyone could be seduced into joining the Buddhafield. Many followers come from privileged backgrounds, which leads me to wonder whether the search for enlightenment is a   phenomenon. Are people who work three jobs to make ends meet too busy to worry about their inner selves?  Many in the group seemed to have lapsed from the faith I was born into, Catholicism. A handful of others are former Bible Belt Protestants. With its positive message and promise of unconditional, universal love, the Buddhafield holds a special appeal to people seeking an alternative to all that guilt and fire and brimstone.  These people are not flakes    far from it. Many graduated from good colleges and were looking ahead to promising careers. They just had big questions. They wondered why they were here. What was the point? Were they missing something?  Their adventure looked like great fun    at first. What     hasn't thought about sharing space with a group of other attractive,   people? It's like running away to join the circus.  ”There was this really hot guy. . ..” That's all it took to hook Alessandra Burenin, who came to the festival from Austin, where she now sells real estate. The line always draws a laugh from film festival audiences. ”The spiritual stuff came later,” she says.   Despite the guru's admonitions against wasting cosmic energy on sex, former members say the Buddhafield soon turned into what one jokingly called ”the Bootyfield.”  Allen takes full advantage of his 22 years of footage to show the upside of Buddhafield life. The group dynamic was so good that it was easy to overlook the guru's eccentricities at first. So what if he uses a little too much guyliner? So what if a follower carries his portable chair around like a throne? So what if attendants called ”bodyworkers” serve at his beck and call, providing    massages? So what if he's dabbling so much with plastic surgery that he's starting to look a little scary. People in the Buddhafield didn't live in walled compounds or cut themselves off from the outside world. They rented houses and apartments, which they shared with other members in their circle of friends. And they had day jobs. But there were no children, and no pets. Women who got pregnant, according to former followers, were told to have abortions because the teacher instructs them that children and personal enlightenment didn't mix.  By 2006, when holy hell finally broke loose inside the group, the Buddhafield's intricate   of interpersonal relationships sustained some followers even as they abandoned their master. But the breakup was messy. Just like the breakup of a real family.  An email leads to 'the Big Ugly' The end of the Buddhafield as Allen and the others knew it began with an email. The group had been in Austin about a decade when a member announced he was done for good. And he was letting everybody know why: the pervasive psychological and sexual abuse he'd witnessed.  He accused the guru of using hypnotherapy techniques to plant suggestions during the $50 weekly ”cleansing sessions” all members of the Buddhafield underwent. And he accused him of improper sexual relationships with some of his closest male followers.  ”He used the sex with his disciples as a spiritual gift, spiritual growth, and a path to further enlightenment,” said the email, which Allen showed me. ”He manipulated people to feel that if they didn't take this sexual step, they weren't devoted to God and his work. His ability to control people's psyches was unsurpassed,” the email continued. Followers began to talk among themselves, and that's when Allen, Goldstein and Johnston say they first learned that their leader had been manipulating all of them for years. It would take just awhile longer for each of them to see it as sexual abuse.  ”He has, in fact, broken my heart,” the  's email continued. ”I loved him as much or more than many of you. I was close to him. .. very close. When I returned to the Buddhafield 3 years ago it was very apparent to me that things had changed radically.” The master's message no longer was about connecting with God. It was all about the master. ”The songs ceased to be about God anymore, and were all about master. The events,   movies, ballets, as well as the vibrations inside of us, were no longer about God . .. they were about master. Instead of 'connecting to God's love,' it was 'connect to my love'. ..  This says it all.” Johnston left the group in Austin. Allen held on a little while longer, working to relocate Andreas to Hawaii with the idea that he'd no longer hold himself out as a master or seek out followers.  The Buddhafield broke into warring factions    ”the Big Ugly,” they called the breakup    and eventually dissolved. The house was sold, and Gleis got her money back.  But Gleis was done, too. In the movie, she looks into Allen's eyes and angry tears well in her eyes. She says that though she knew him for 25 years, she had no idea about the dark secrets he'd been keeping. If she had, she says, she would have done something about it much sooner. She weeps as she describes how it felt to be demonized and ostracized by people she'd known for decades.   The box, ”Did you tell her about the box, Will?” Gleis is insistent that I hear about the box as we weave through a throng of tourist traffic. We're on our way to the Duke Hotel, one of the island's oldest and most elegant, for a round of fancy umbrella drinks. Yes, former members of the Buddhafield drink. And eat. And sing karaoke.  The mood turns somber as this Peter Pan of a tour guide speaks of his own abuse. For him, it was utterly degrading.  ”I would have to get ready for sex with him. You guys were all at satsang, singing,” Allen says, referring to one of the group's regular  spiritual gatherings. ”I would come over, and he would do his ritual with me,” he says. ”He was sitting in a chair, and I was kneeling in front of him. There was no intimacy there was no real love. People say we were in some sort of relationship? There was no relationship.” The guru would pleasure himself to pornography, he says, and then ”I would come in and be the finishing person.”  He recalls the next part of his story slowly, as if reliving the pain as he speaks. ”He'd go, 'OK, it's time to go get the box,' ” Allen says. ”He was a short man, and I'm a tall man. So, he'd be, 'Go get the box!' ”  Allen says he would try to distract himself.  ”As he was doing it to me, I'd just go, 'It's almost over. It's almost over.' And as soon as it was over, I'd go, 'OK, you don't have to think about this for a whole other week.' And so, for the next few days everything would be great. I'd have my community. We'd never talk about it. And then it would be Tuesday again, and I'd get nervous. And Wednesday I'd be, 'Oh my God, tomorrow's the night.' And Thursday I'd be panicking. But then I'd go, 'I made it, I don't have to worry about it for another week.' And that went on for 4½ years.”   ”I didn't register it as abuse,” he explains. ”I just thought, 'It's my problem. Why am I not surrendered?' I just didn't ever know what was happening to me. And then I had to love him like he was my guru. I had to honor and respect him as my guru, and that's when I started hating him. I was PTSD without even knowing it.” ”So romantic,” he adds, sarcasm dripping from his voice.  A day at the beach, I am amazed at how free of anger and bitterness Allen and his friends are. Whatever resentment and ill will they once felt seem to have vanished. Though their experiences might have been dark, there is a unique lightness about each of them. They are happy. Not everything about their Buddhafield experience was negative.  It's as though they've grabbed hold of some sort of fountain of youth. As Gleis says, ”I think we held up pretty well.”  Something takes hold of these former cult members when they are together. They even speak differently. Allen, for example, stops rushing about long enough to look me in the eye. ”I'm communicating with you,” he blurts out.  Since when were you not?  At other times, when they are all speaking at once, I find myself waiting for someone to referee they're like children who don't know how to wait their turn. At different times I want to pass each one of them the ”talking pillow.”  We're still waiting to hear back from the guru, although the prospects of actually meeting him grow dimmer by the minute as my departure time nears. So I decide to follow the group as they set out on some good,   island fun,  .  I've noticed over the weekend how these Buddhafield friends share an easy, deep connection. It reminds me of a reunion of college roommates or members of a championship team. Or maybe my first newspaper, since journalism is the cult I chose to squander my youth on.  The Buddhafield experience is so totally ”The Big Chill,” and who doesn't want some of that? I want to know more about this Peter Pan lifestyle and these people who feel free to climb mountains and dive into volcanic mud pits and bodysurf the big waves    because they feel like it. I want to know what the next adventure will be.  A plan is hatched to find a beach, the kind where waves curl over a long strip of sand. We set out, packing an SUV and a Prius full of   children. We push past Diamond Head, toward the windward side of the island, finally settling on Sandy Beach, which is crowded with surfers and boogie boarders.  The talk in the car is easy, even if I don't have much to contribute to conversations that begin with, ”Remember when we had that   with. . ..” (Allen says he wasn't there.)  Storm clouds are building, and the ocean is blue and green and white, but the waves are powerful, breaking forcefully right on top of the sand. Eventually, I catch one, perfectly. I feel my body drop from the top of the wave, sliding along the glassy inner curve. Then comes the white explosion, and I fully expect to be ground into the sand. But, kowabunga! I am pushed out ahead of the roiling foam and ride into shore.  Once again, I am 10 years old, and I've just caught the perfect wave. ",False,"Honolulu (CNN)Dipsh*t! Dumb ass!  Call off your psychotic Chihuahua wife!  So much for peace, love and good karma. We're attending a screening at the 27th annual Honolulu Rainbow Film Festival, and midway through a QA session with the cast of tonight's documentary the mood turns dark, more like Friday Night Fights. The circle of security guards tightens, just in case. People in the front rows get ready to duck. Some stand and approach the stage. Are these two dudes, a yoga teacher and a hairdresser by trade, really about to start swinging? What in the name of holy hell is going on? Holy Hell, in fact, is the reason everyone is packed into the Doris Duke Theatre at the Honolulu Museum of Art on a steamy Friday night in August. It's the name of Will Allen's documentary, backed by Academy      Jared Leto, and it tells the story of how Allen and his friends spent more than two decades in a New   spiritual group they called the Buddhafield.  In his search for enlightenment, Allen followed an eccentric,   guru from West Hollywood to Austin, Texas, and then to Hawaii's Lanikai Beach, about a   drive from this theater. One night about 10 years ago, he simply left the guru behind, here in Hawaii.  He walked away in the wake of allegations that the guru had been sexually abusing young male followers for years. Allen says he was one of them. In the decade since, Allen and his Buddhafield friends have moved on, but a new group has grown up in their place. So Allen has come back to Hawaii to lay his film at the feet of his former guru. He sees Holy Hell as a cautionary tale, and wants people here to know what happened to him and his friends    so it won't happen to them.  That's why fear and loathing are sweeping the yoga studios of Oahu, and why death threats are being reported to police. It's why people are eyeing each other at the Whole Foods store in the Kailua Town Center and wondering, Are you in that cult?  And it's why Murti Hower and Jentry Petzold look like they're about to throttle each other up on stage.  The two men met in Austin and say they love each other like brothers. But there's one big difference between them: Hower, one of the original Buddhafield recruiters featured in the film, no longer follows the teacher. As for Petzold, well, all he'll say is his relationship with the teacher is far more cordial.  Petzold and another emissary, Martin Doluz, insist they aren't in a cult, and that their guru isn't brainwashing or sexually abusing anybody. The both say they owe him everything. The loose collection of followers, many tied into Oahu's yoga and   communities, isn't organized enough to qualify as a group, they insist.  It doesn't even have a name.  But the others on stage    director Allen and some who appear in the film, Hower, Chris Johnston, Julian Goldstein, Radhia Gleis and Alessandra Burenin    all say they were brainwashed and manipulated. Looking back, they have no doubt that the Buddhafield was a cult.  Along the way, they say, they lost their spiritual innocence, their identities and even their ability to make decisions for themselves.  Now they say they're hearing disturbing things from friends on the island, that the master they knew as Andreas is not laying low, as he'd promised them he would. He's collecting new acolytes and calling himself Reyji. It means  .  Concerned neighbors say he has taken to walking the streets of Lanikai in disguise    with a cane and wearing a white surgical mask. But Doluz insists that's another spiritual leader who has taken up residence on the island with a band of followers.  But, just before the film festival, Andreas moved to a bigger, more secure home nearby. Alllen's spies are calling this compound The Fortress.  Those close to Reyji see the filmmaker's actions as an aggression. This impression is underscored when a mass mailing marketing the film hits every mailbox within a   radius of Lanikai Beach.  The film he doesn't want you to see, says one side of a postcard announcing that Holy Hell is available on iTunes, Amazon and soon will be on Netflix. (The documentary also airs on CNN at 9 p. m. Thursday.)  Hower, meanwhile, says he's being harassed, more so now that the film is being shown on the island he calls home. He's afraid of what will happen when everybody else goes home. The   fireworks with Petzold blow over. Still, tensions run high in the community as Holy Hell is unleashed on the unsuspecting island of Oahu.

It isn't much of a confrontation, instead playing out like an awkward chance meeting with an ex.  Are you being a good boy? Allen asks, and the guru pushes back, saying he is less concerned with good and more interested in what is best. Are you being your best boy? Allen persists, and the guru just smiles cryptically and says, I'm just being.  That was at the outset of Allen's   film project. A lot has happened since then. Allen says he cried every day he worked on Holy Hell.  Hawaii is stirring up some emotions. It's the place Allen says the guru first initiated sex with him. And, years later, it was the place where he finally decided to leave the Buddhafield afer 22 years. Still, he doesn't hesitate when I ask him to help me find Reyji    or people who know him    so I can hear another side of the story. Allen agrees, partly because he's a nice, helpful guy. Perhaps, there's an even more powerful motivator for a filmmaker: curiosity.  We drive the Lanikai Beach neighborhood, up narrow residential streets that wind into the hills from the beach. Allen rides shotgun and navigates, with some   help from Chris Johnston, who appears in the film. We find the house where Allen filmed Reyji before, and neighbors say he's been there until very recently. The yard is overgrown, and a tall fence is posted with No Trespassing signs. Although Reyji must be well into his 70s by now, neighbors report that the guru still strolls down the street in his Speedo.  We are trying to figure out the best way to approach people who are friendly with Reyji when Allen spots somebody he recognizes behind the wheel of a pickup. We turn around and follow the truck up the hill. It comes to rest at a carport in front of a hillside home with a killer view.  We chat for a bit with Alan, who won't give his last name and says he is no longer with the group.  As he speaks, Alan stares into the distance with the bluest eyes I've ever seen. His pupils are tiny, his squint unwavering. This won't be the last intense,   stare I'll witness over the weekend.   A young woman with long, strawberry blond hair arrives and immediately lights into Will Allen. How dare he? How dare he film her and use her image without permission?  They get into an animated conversation it turns out that she can be seen in the crowd in one of the final scenes. Allen points out that she was filmed in public, and that to most viewers she's just a passing face in the crowd.  She accuses him of diminishing her and once again they start arguing. This time, she lashes out: You're interrupting. That's the fourth time you've interrupted me.  And, speaking of boundaries . .. Aren't you on my property? Allen says he'd been invited up to talk with Alan, who hadn't objected when I tagged along. Still, we take it as our cue to go.  I leave them with my contact information I'm very interested, I assure them, in their point of view.  That night, at the first showing of the film, I encounter Petzold, there to represent Team Reyji. He promises to relay a message to the teacher. We decide to scale back our guru hunt and let things play out. No point in spooking him.  Reyji has seen the film, and it saddens him, say those professing to be close to him. While dealing with Petzold, I hear from Martin Doluz. He is a yoga teacher who describes himself as a good friend in daily,    contact with the guru.  The first half of the movie showed an experience similar to his own, he said. Beautiful. But not the second half of the movie. That was nothing like his experience. And, like the blond woman in the driveway, he didn't appreciate being shown without his permission in a film about a cult.  Doluz suggests I might actually get to meet the guru. But, by the end of a lengthy conversation that includes some deep   on Doluz's part, I am advised not to change my travel plans. Instead, a couple of days later Doluz and Petzold each pass along an emailed statement from Michel.   It is heartbreaking to see how history has been rewritten, the statement begins.  'Holy Hell' is not a documentary, rather, it is a work of fiction designed to create drama, fear and persecution, knowing that is what sells. The statement continues, with a personal appeal to his former followers:  I am saddened by this attempt to obscure the message of universal love and spiritual awakening. It is devastating to see these friends, who were once so filled with love for the world, become so angry. I wish them only the best, and hold each one close to my heart. If any of my actions were a catalyst for their disharmony, I am truly sorry. And he ends with a wish: May all beings find peace. Supporters of the guru argue that he's harmless. Petzold says the former members featured in Holy Hell seem to suffer from a bad case of buyer's remorse.  Any sexual contact, the guru's supporters say, was consensual and came within the context of   relationships. It isn't happening now, they insist. Doluz says that even if that should be offered, a disciple can always turn down a sexual advance.  Allen and his friends, Goldstein and Johnston, argue that they were never interested in their guru sexually. They all were much younger than   when they say he groomed them and turned them into his concubines. He was a creature of habit, and they say he reserved a day for each of them: Allen was Thursdays, Goldstein was Tuesdays and Saturdays, and Johnston, who is straight, always drew Mondays. They had been taught to bow in submission as a way to connect with God. That was how their guru groomed them, they say.    But submission should never be confused with consent, they insist. How can you consent to sex with somebody who has power over you, who holds the key to your spiritual enlightenment?  How can you equate that to consent when the imbalance of power is so great? Johnston asks.  It is an argument similar to those made by survivors of clergy abuse scandals. Something else he says in the film seems to resonate with audiences, no matter whether they're at Sundance, or in Austin, Los Angeles or Honolulu. Cults are everywhere, Johnston states. I guarantee you there's a cult right here in your town.  The toll the Buddhafield took can be counted in years lost, relationships abandoned, opportunities missed.  My 20s? Gone! says Johnston, who was known as Ricky and was said to be one of the guru's favorites. My 30s    gone!  My 40s    gone! So rues another follower, Vera Chieffo. My 50s    gone! Radhia Gleis picks up the count. An accomplished equestrienne, she gave up her career to follow the guru and eventually rose to become one of his top aides. She regrets not having children. In trying to find enlightenment, they lost themselves and the best years of their lives.  Welcome to the 'Bootyfield'  Sitting through two showings of Holy Hell, it's easy to understand how anyone could be seduced into joining the Buddhafield. Many followers come from privileged backgrounds, which leads me to wonder whether the search for enlightenment is a   phenomenon. Are people who work three jobs to make ends meet too busy to worry about their inner selves?  Many in the group seemed to have lapsed from the faith I was born into, Catholicism. A handful of others are former Bible Belt Protestants. With its positive message and promise of unconditional, universal love, the Buddhafield holds a special appeal to people seeking an alternative to all that guilt and fire and brimstone.  These people are not flakes    far from it. Many graduated from good colleges and were looking ahead to promising careers. They just had big questions. They wondered why they were here. What was the point? Were they missing something?  Their adventure looked like great fun    at first. What     hasn't thought about sharing space with a group of other attractive,   people? It's like running away to join the circus.  There was this really hot guy. . .. That's all it took to hook Alessandra Burenin, who came to the festival from Austin, where she now sells real estate. The line always draws a laugh from film festival audiences. The spiritual stuff came later, she says.   Despite the guru's admonitions against wasting cosmic energy on sex, former members say the Buddhafield soon turned into what one jokingly called the Bootyfield.  Allen takes full advantage of his 22 years of footage to show the upside of Buddhafield life. The group dynamic was so good that it was easy to overlook the guru's eccentricities at first. So what if he uses a little too much guyliner? So what if a follower carries his portable chair around like a throne? So what if attendants called bodyworkers serve at his beck and call, providing    massages? So what if he's dabbling so much with plastic surgery that he's starting to look a little scary. People in the Buddhafield didn't live in walled compounds or cut themselves off from the outside world. They rented houses and apartments, which they shared with other members in their circle of friends. And they had day jobs. But there were no children, and no pets. Women who got pregnant, according to former followers, were told to have abortions because the teacher instructs them that children and personal enlightenment didn't mix.  By 2006, when holy hell finally broke loose inside the group, the Buddhafield's intricate   of interpersonal relationships sustained some followers even as they abandoned their master. But the breakup was messy. Just like the breakup of a real family.  An email leads to 'the Big Ugly' The end of the Buddhafield as Allen and the others knew it began with an email. The group had been in Austin about a decade when a member announced he was done for good. And he was letting everybody know why: the pervasive psychological and sexual abuse he'd witnessed.  He accused the guru of using hypnotherapy techniques to plant suggestions during the $50 weekly cleansing sessions all members of the Buddhafield underwent. And he accused him of improper sexual relationships with some of his closest male followers.  He used the sex with his disciples as a spiritual gift, spiritual growth, and a path to further enlightenment, said the email, which Allen showed me. He manipulated people to feel that if they didn't take this sexual step, they weren't devoted to God and his work. His ability to control people's psyches was unsurpassed, the email continued. Followers began to talk among themselves, and that's when Allen, Goldstein and Johnston say they first learned that their leader had been manipulating all of them for years. It would take just awhile longer for each of them to see it as sexual abuse.  He has, in fact, broken my heart, the  's email continued. I loved him as much or more than many of you. I was close to him. .. very close. When I returned to the Buddhafield 3 years ago it was very apparent to me that things had changed radically. The master's message no longer was about connecting with God. It was all about the master. The songs ceased to be about God anymore, and were all about master. The events,   movies, ballets, as well as the vibrations inside of us, were no longer about God . .. they were about master. Instead of 'connecting to God's love,' it was 'connect to my love'. ..  This says it all. Johnston left the group in Austin. Allen held on a little while longer, working to relocate Andreas to Hawaii with the idea that he'd no longer hold himself out as a master or seek out followers.  The Buddhafield broke into warring factions    the Big Ugly, they called the breakup    and eventually dissolved. The house was sold, and Gleis got her money back.  But Gleis was done, too. In the movie, she looks into Allen's eyes and angry tears well in her eyes. She says that though she knew him for 25 years, she had no idea about the dark secrets he'd been keeping. If she had, she says, she would have done something about it much sooner. She weeps as she describes how it felt to be demonized and ostracized by people she'd known for decades.   The box, Did you tell her about the box, Will? Gleis is insistent that I hear about the box as we weave through a throng of tourist traffic. We're on our way to the Duke Hotel, one of the island's oldest and most elegant, for a round of fancy umbrella drinks. Yes, former members of the Buddhafield drink. And eat. And sing karaoke.  The mood turns somber as this Peter Pan of a tour guide speaks of his own abuse. For him, it was utterly degrading.  I would have to get ready for sex with him. You guys were all at satsang, singing, Allen says, referring to one of the group's regular  spiritual gatherings. I would come over, and he would do his ritual with me, he says. He was sitting in a chair, and I was kneeling in front of him. There was no intimacy there was no real love. People say we were in some sort of relationship? There was no relationship. The guru would pleasure himself to pornography, he says, and then I would come in and be the finishing person.  He recalls the next part of his story slowly, as if reliving the pain as he speaks. He'd go, 'OK, it's time to go get the box,'  Allen says. He was a short man, and I'm a tall man. So, he'd be, 'Go get the box!'   Allen says he would try to distract himself.  As he was doing it to me, I'd just go, 'It's almost over. It's almost over.' And as soon as it was over, I'd go, 'OK, you don't have to think about this for a whole other week.' And so, for the next few days everything would be great. I'd have my community. We'd never talk about it. And then it would be Tuesday again, and I'd get nervous. And Wednesday I'd be, 'Oh my God, tomorrow's the night.' And Thursday I'd be panicking. But then I'd go, 'I made it, I don't have to worry about it for another week.' And that went on for 4 years.   I didn't register it as abuse, he explains. I just thought, 'It's my problem. Why am I not surrendered?' I just didn't ever know what was happening to me. And then I had to love him like he was my guru. I had to honor and respect him as my guru, and that's when I started hating him. I was PTSD without even knowing it. So romantic, he adds, sarcasm dripping from his voice.  A day at the beach, I am amazed at how free of anger and bitterness Allen and his friends are. Whatever resentment and ill will they once felt seem to have vanished. Though their experiences might have been dark, there is a unique lightness about each of them. They are happy. Not everything about their Buddhafield experience was negative.  It's as though they've grabbed hold of some sort of fountain of youth. As Gleis says, I think we held up pretty well.  Something takes hold of these former cult members when they are together. They even speak differently. Allen, for example, stops rushing about long enough to look me in the eye. I'm communicating with you, he blurts out.  Since when were you not?  At other times, when they are all speaking at once, I find myself waiting for someone to referee they're like children who don't know how to wait their turn. At different times I want to pass each one of them the talking pillow.  We're still waiting to hear back from the guru, although the prospects of actually meeting him grow dimmer by the minute as my departure time nears. So I decide to follow the group as they set out on some good,   island fun,  .  I've noticed over the weekend how these Buddhafield friends share an easy, deep connection. It reminds me of a reunion of college roommates or members of a championship team. Or maybe my first newspaper, since journalism is the cult I chose to squander my youth on.  The Buddhafield experience is so totally The Big Chill, and who doesn't want some of that? I want to know more about this Peter Pan lifestyle and these people who feel free to climb mountains and dive into volcanic mud pits and bodysurf the big waves    because they feel like it. I want to know what the next adventure will be.  A plan is hatched to find a beach, the kind where waves curl over a long strip of sand. We set out, packing an SUV and a Prius full of   children. We push past Diamond Head, toward the windward side of the island, finally settling on Sandy Beach, which is crowded with surfers and boogie boarders.  The talk in the car is easy, even if I don't have much to contribute to conversations that begin with, Remember when we had that   with. . .. (Allen says he wasn't there.)  Storm clouds are building, and the ocean is blue and green and white, but the waves are powerful, breaking forcefully right on top of the sand. Eventually, I catch one, perfectly. I feel my body drop from the top of the wave, sliding along the glassy inner curve. Then comes the white explosion, and I fully expect to be ground into the sand. But, kowabunga! I am pushed out ahead of the roiling foam and ride into shore.  Once again, I am 10 years old, and I've just caught the perfect wave. "
94,38537,57385,Zika found in mosquitoes in Miami Beach,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) Mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus have been identified in Miami Beach, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said Thursday.  It's the first finding of   mosquitoes in the continental USA.  The three mosquito samples that tested positive were from the area in Miami Beach that was previously identified as an area of local transmission.  ”This is disappointing but not surprising,” said Adam Putnam, the Florida commissioner of agriculture.    measures and mosquito trapping are already in place in the area.  ”We already knew because of human cases [that] Zika transmission was occurring positive pools are just further indication that transmission is still occurring in the area,” CDC spokeswoman Candice Hoffmann said.  It was unclear when those mosquitoes were caught, although spraying has been ongoing throughout the area.  One of the mosquito traps with   mosquitoes was in the botanical gardens, according to   County Mayor Carlos Gimenez. The location of the other two traps where infected mosquitoes were caught was not disclosed. Sixteen other mosquito traps in   tested negative, Gimenez said, adding that tests on additional mosquitoes are underway.  Gimenez emphasized that the finding of these mosquitoes will not change current efforts to fight the virus and the mosquitoes that carry it. ”The message remains the same: If you have standing water, drain it, cover it please wear adequate clothing wear repellant,” he said.  Dr. Chris Braden, director of the division of foodborne, waterborne and environmental diseases at the CDC's National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases, said the finding helps inform and focus   measures. On August 11, the CDC warned pregnant women to avoid a    area of Miami Beach after the state confirmed local transmission of the virus there.  On July 29, Scott announced that the first local transmission of the virus in the continental USA had occurred in the Wynwood neighborhood, north of downtown Miami.  Aggressive   measures were begun, including mosquito spraying in the area. At the time, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said that finding a   mosquito is like finding a needle in a haystack, and doing so is not necessary to confirm local mosquito transmission. To date, there have been 49 locally transmitted cases of the virus in Florida, according to the state Department of Health.   of those have been in   County. Florida is the only state in the continental USA where local transmission has occurred.

95,38562,57410,From a life sentence to clemency from Obama,CNN,Wesley Bruer,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,", Sharanda Jones says she was never told she could be facing life in prison after being indicted for seven counts of conspiracy to traffic cocaine. It was her first criminal offense. During her   trial, prosecutors were unable to produce any physical evidence that Jones actually ever possessed, bought, or sold cocaine and according to courtroom testimony, relied mostly on the word of admitted drug dealers and users who received leniency in exchange for their testimony. When the judge read the verdicts    ”not guilty” for six counts and ”guilty” of one    Jones felt somewhat relieved. That feeling wouldn't last very long.  As she listened to prosecutors tallying up the factors that determined jail time in federal court, Jones realized that she would be spending much more than the five or so years she expected in a worst case scenario.  The 23. 92 kilos of crack cocaine Jones was convicted of conspiring to traffic would have yielded a maximum sentence of just around 24 years' imprisonment based on federal sentencing guidelines. But prosecutors then began to argue for sentencing enhancements. A concealed carry permit in her name was used as evidence that a firearm was present ”in furtherance of a drug conspiracy.” She was listed as a ” ” of the conspiracy. And she committed perjury, they said, according to court documents, ”for her false denials of guilt on the stand.”  Prosecutors argued that due to the amount of time she was facing, Jones should be held until sentencing. The judge agreed.  ”My attorney told me, 'Don't say anything,' that [he'll] do all the talking and just stand there. And I see marshals coming and I didn't know what that meant, not knowing they were coming to lock me up,” Jones said.  Jones was immediately taken into custody after her guilty verdict, which was a shock in itself considering it was her first encounter with the criminal justice system. That morning she had dropped her daughter off at school, gone to work at the diner she   and attended her hearing during her lunch break. Jones recalls that she even left her purse in her car that day, thinking she would have time to sort her affairs well before beginning to serve out her punishment.  Jones was sentenced in November 1999 to mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole. She would never again drop her daughter off at school, work another shift in her diner, or drive the car unintentionally abandoned in the Dallas courthouse parking lot. ”I remember him saying 'I'm sentencing you to life' and I was just numb,” Jones said. ”I couldn't understand it. I was just blank. My body was numb. I couldn't cry. I couldn't process it at all.”  Sharanda wasn't the only member of her family headed to jail for this conspiracy case. Her sister Sherena served six years for what prosecutors portrayed as a minor role in the conspiracy. Her brother Ernest was sentenced to 18 years in prison. And her mother, a quadriplegic since a car accident at the age of 20, was sentenced to a 17 years.  The Case, The Jones family were just four of more than 100 black residents of Terrell, Texas, rounded up in a drug sweep aimed at crack cocaine users, dealers, and suppliers in 1997. Over the following two years, the Kaufman County Sheriff Department, Terrell, Texas police detectives, and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents would leverage those arrested for   offenses into giving up information on fellow users, dealers, and suppliers. With many defendants facing long ”mandatory minimum” sentences for   drug offenses, government informants were not hard to come by    friends and neighbors testified against one another to downplay their involvement in the conspiracy. Those that testified or ”snitched” received leniency in their sentences. Those that didn't faced the harshest punishment. Drug users and low level drug dealers receiving jail terms reserved for the most notorious kingpins, Jones says.  Sharanda's decision not to snitch would prove costly.  ”They arrested a couple I knew, a couple I had dealt with in the past and they implicated me.” Jones explained. ”Not as their main supplier but as someone who could just help them out.” The couple, Julie Franklin and Keith Jackson, acquaintances of the Jones family, had called Sharanda pleading for her to front them drugs to be sold later as they were hard pressed for money. Unbeknownst to Jones, their conversation was being recorded and listened to by the DEA. At first, Jones reluctantly agreed to try to connect them with a woman who may be able to provide them with drugs to sell, but ultimately told them she was back running the diner and that any drug contacts she had known are ”long gone, all gone,” according to court documents.   That couple later testified that Jones had previously provided them with 40 kilograms of powder cocaine to be converted to crack. Additionally, a Houston cocaine supplier, Joseph Antoine testified that he provided Jones with cocaine to be sold at the family ”crack house” that Jones and her siblings and mother were alleged to be dealing from, accusing Jones herself of setting the market price for crack cocaine in the area.  ”Evidence of Sharanda Jones's involvement in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine at 705 Rosehill is sufficient, though only barely so,” according to a ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upholding her conviction.  ”They clearly testified that I was the middle person because they actually got the main character and they got the low level drug dealers and they put me in the middle of both of them,” Jones said.  Julie Franklin and Keith Jackson would be later sentenced to seven and eight years with Antoine, the main supplier, receiving     years. All have since been released.  Doing Time, On November 10, 1999 BOP Prisoner No.   began her life sentence at a Tallahassee, Florida federal prison before being transferred a year later to Carswell federal prison in Forth Worth, Texas alongside her mother, who was on the medical floor that she described as a ”nursing home type setting,” and her sister, Sherena, who she shared a unit with.  ”Those are    rooms and there are four people in those rooms,” Sharanda recalled. ”That's harsh living.”  Despite the severity of her sentence, Jones insists she never let it break her. ”All the staff can tell you I never programmed my mind to say life. And people would ask me how much time I had. I just could never get life out. It just didn't seem right rolling off my tongue,” Jones said. ”I just knew an appeal will work. Maybe I'll do five, ten, 15 years at the most because I am guilty. But not for no life sentence.”  Nonetheless, Jones settled in for a long stint. ”You can be in any group in prison. They have a wild group, they have a calm group, they have older people. So, I kind of like stick with my group the older people, watch the news daily and that's how I kept up with what was going on in the world,” Jones said.  The remote possibility of freedom in the future, no matter how distant, kept Jones far away from all the trouble or temptations a prisoner may face in trying to escape from their realities. ”The pill line is the number one thing there. Just drugs, drugs, drugs. I had to get two knee replacements and all they could offer me is Percocets and OxyContin. I always turned down narcotics. Friends before had already told me, 'Don't take a narcotic, we took them when we came here and now we are addicted to those drugs',” Jones said.  Jones wasn't a perfect prisoner, she admits, having to occasionally sneak pass a particularly strict guard who refused to let Jones into the medical ward to see her mother.  ”We based the rest of our lives around helping our mom,” Jones said.  But no matter how much family she had around her to ease the pain of being incarcerated, she could not wrap her mind around how unfair her sentence seemed. ”We had rapists, murderers. The prison I was at had a max unit where people have done horrible crimes and they still had a number, they still had a [release] date. And I would compare myself to those people cause my cell was facing the max unit. when they take people in and out I'm looking at that. I'm looking at how they chained and shackled up and I'm chained and shackled up and I'm like, this just don't match up to me,” Sharanda recalled with cracks in her voice.  In 2009, Jones received an unexpected visit in prison from a stranger that would change her life. Brittany Byrd was still a law student when she stumbled upon Jones' case and began to research it. The daughter of an incarcerated mother, Byrd was moved to action. Soon, Byrd visited Jones, who at the time had no legal representation as all her appeals had been exhausted, and convinced her that she would take the case all the way to the White House if she had to, until Jones was a free woman.  ”I was like, you know, God you really sending someone to help me and from that day on, our vibes grew stronger and our belief grew together like this is gonna happen one day so we started working on the clemency,” Jones said, describing how it felt to meet Byrd. But it wasn't until her mother died, one year away from her release, that Sharanda really set her mind on freedom. Jones recalls the last exchange she had with her mother. ”She said I gotta go out to the hospital and said 'I'll see you tomorrow'. The next day they called and said she had 24 hours to live and I didn't understand that. That was like all I knew at Carswell was to be with her,” Jones said, crying. ”As soon as my mother passed I said I knew I'm going home. I scheduled my routine around her so, that's all I knew.”  Getting Out, To date, Obama has granted 673 commutations, with 232 of those individuals initially serving life sentences. According to Neil Eggleston, White House counsel to the President, these individuals ”received unduly harsh sentences under outdated laws for committing largely nonviolent drug crimes.”  And while recent drug sentencing reforms, such as former Attorney General Holder's ”Smart on Crime Initiative,” which prioritizes federal prosecutor resources for the most serious offenses, keep many low level offenders from entering the overcrowded prison system, there was no retroactive mechanism to assist those already convicted.  The only possibility of freedom, they determined, would be a presidential pardon or commutation. Byrd would have to live up to the promise she made and get the Obama administration to pay attention to Sharanda's case. With the clemency petition filed, Byrd began a grassroots campaign to highlight what she saw as a major injustice in Jones' sentence.  One Monday in December 2015, Byrd heard rumors that Obama was scheduled to announce a round of pardons, commutations, and clemencies. ”Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, nothing happened,” Sharanda remembers. ”Then on Friday, the officer called me and told me to go to the back conference room and that just doesn't happen.”  Jones waited alongside another inmate, both uncertain as to why they were being called in but remaining hopeful that their long shot bids for freedom had finally been granted. They began praying together before Jones was then escorted into yet another conference room where a phone call was waiting on her. It was Byrd, her attorney.  ”Brittany, is everything ok?” Jones asked.  ”You're going home!” Byrd screamed as Jones broke down in tears. But just as Jones had to adapt to prison life almost 17 years ago, she now must adapt to life on the outside and reconcile all the moments she's missed with her family. Since being released, Jones has found a job doing clerical work and is trying to rebuild her life while reconnecting with her daughter, Clenesha, who had been without her mother since the age of 8. And while Jones may have missed out on raising her own daughter, she feels she has been blessed with yet another second chance with the birth of her granddaughter three months ago.   Jones plans to use her voice to raise awareness for the need for criminal justice reform. ”I am so grateful for having a second chance at life but I left so many women behind who deserve the same mercy I was given,” Jones said. ”I want to be done but I can't be done until more come home.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this story contained a photo caption that misspelled Reynolds Wintersmith's name.",False,", Sharanda Jones says she was never told she could be facing life in prison after being indicted for seven counts of conspiracy to traffic cocaine. It was her first criminal offense. During her   trial, prosecutors were unable to produce any physical evidence that Jones actually ever possessed, bought, or sold cocaine and according to courtroom testimony, relied mostly on the word of admitted drug dealers and users who received leniency in exchange for their testimony. When the judge read the verdicts    not guilty for six counts and guilty of one    Jones felt somewhat relieved. That feeling wouldn't last very long.  As she listened to prosecutors tallying up the factors that determined jail time in federal court, Jones realized that she would be spending much more than the five or so years she expected in a worst case scenario.  The 23. 92 kilos of crack cocaine Jones was convicted of conspiring to traffic would have yielded a maximum sentence of just around 24 years' imprisonment based on federal sentencing guidelines. But prosecutors then began to argue for sentencing enhancements. A concealed carry permit in her name was used as evidence that a firearm was present in furtherance of a drug conspiracy. She was listed as a   of the conspiracy. And she committed perjury, they said, according to court documents, for her false denials of guilt on the stand.  Prosecutors argued that due to the amount of time she was facing, Jones should be held until sentencing. The judge agreed.  My attorney told me, 'Don't say anything,' that [he'll] do all the talking and just stand there. And I see marshals coming and I didn't know what that meant, not knowing they were coming to lock me up, Jones said.  Jones was immediately taken into custody after her guilty verdict, which was a shock in itself considering it was her first encounter with the criminal justice system. That morning she had dropped her daughter off at school, gone to work at the diner she   and attended her hearing during her lunch break. Jones recalls that she even left her purse in her car that day, thinking she would have time to sort her affairs well before beginning to serve out her punishment.  Jones was sentenced in November 1999 to mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole. She would never again drop her daughter off at school, work another shift in her diner, or drive the car unintentionally abandoned in the Dallas courthouse parking lot. I remember him saying 'I'm sentencing you to life' and I was just numb, Jones said. I couldn't understand it. I was just blank. My body was numb. I couldn't cry. I couldn't process it at all.  Sharanda wasn't the only member of her family headed to jail for this conspiracy case. Her sister Sherena served six years for what prosecutors portrayed as a minor role in the conspiracy. Her brother Ernest was sentenced to 18 years in prison. And her mother, a quadriplegic since a car accident at the age of 20, was sentenced to a 17 years.  The Case, The Jones family were just four of more than 100 black residents of Terrell, Texas, rounded up in a drug sweep aimed at crack cocaine users, dealers, and suppliers in 1997. Over the following two years, the Kaufman County Sheriff Department, Terrell, Texas police detectives, and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents would leverage those arrested for   offenses into giving up information on fellow users, dealers, and suppliers. With many defendants facing long mandatory minimum sentences for   drug offenses, government informants were not hard to come by    friends and neighbors testified against one another to downplay their involvement in the conspiracy. Those that testified or snitched received leniency in their sentences. Those that didn't faced the harshest punishment. Drug users and low level drug dealers receiving jail terms reserved for the most notorious kingpins, Jones says.  Sharanda's decision not to snitch would prove costly.  They arrested a couple I knew, a couple I had dealt with in the past and they implicated me. Jones explained. Not as their main supplier but as someone who could just help them out. The couple, Julie Franklin and Keith Jackson, acquaintances of the Jones family, had called Sharanda pleading for her to front them drugs to be sold later as they were hard pressed for money. Unbeknownst to Jones, their conversation was being recorded and listened to by the DEA. At first, Jones reluctantly agreed to try to connect them with a woman who may be able to provide them with drugs to sell, but ultimately told them she was back running the diner and that any drug contacts she had known are long gone, all gone, according to court documents.   That couple later testified that Jones had previously provided them with 40 kilograms of powder cocaine to be converted to crack. Additionally, a Houston cocaine supplier, Joseph Antoine testified that he provided Jones with cocaine to be sold at the family crack house that Jones and her siblings and mother were alleged to be dealing from, accusing Jones herself of setting the market price for crack cocaine in the area.  Evidence of Sharanda Jones's involvement in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine at 705 Rosehill is sufficient, though only barely so, according to a ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upholding her conviction.  They clearly testified that I was the middle person because they actually got the main character and they got the low level drug dealers and they put me in the middle of both of them, Jones said.  Julie Franklin and Keith Jackson would be later sentenced to seven and eight years with Antoine, the main supplier, receiving     years. All have since been released.  Doing Time, On November 10, 1999 BOP Prisoner No.   began her life sentence at a Tallahassee, Florida federal prison before being transferred a year later to Carswell federal prison in Forth Worth, Texas alongside her mother, who was on the medical floor that she described as a nursing home type setting, and her sister, Sherena, who she shared a unit with.  Those are    rooms and there are four people in those rooms, Sharanda recalled. That's harsh living.  Despite the severity of her sentence, Jones insists she never let it break her. All the staff can tell you I never programmed my mind to say life. And people would ask me how much time I had. I just could never get life out. It just didn't seem right rolling off my tongue, Jones said. I just knew an appeal will work. Maybe I'll do five, ten, 15 years at the most because I am guilty. But not for no life sentence.  Nonetheless, Jones settled in for a long stint. You can be in any group in prison. They have a wild group, they have a calm group, they have older people. So, I kind of like stick with my group the older people, watch the news daily and that's how I kept up with what was going on in the world, Jones said.  The remote possibility of freedom in the future, no matter how distant, kept Jones far away from all the trouble or temptations a prisoner may face in trying to escape from their realities. The pill line is the number one thing there. Just drugs, drugs, drugs. I had to get two knee replacements and all they could offer me is Percocets and OxyContin. I always turned down narcotics. Friends before had already told me, 'Don't take a narcotic, we took them when we came here and now we are addicted to those drugs', Jones said.  Jones wasn't a perfect prisoner, she admits, having to occasionally sneak pass a particularly strict guard who refused to let Jones into the medical ward to see her mother.  We based the rest of our lives around helping our mom, Jones said.  But no matter how much family she had around her to ease the pain of being incarcerated, she could not wrap her mind around how unfair her sentence seemed. We had rapists, murderers. The prison I was at had a max unit where people have done horrible crimes and they still had a number, they still had a [release] date. And I would compare myself to those people cause my cell was facing the max unit. when they take people in and out I'm looking at that. I'm looking at how they chained and shackled up and I'm chained and shackled up and I'm like, this just don't match up to me, Sharanda recalled with cracks in her voice.  In 2009, Jones received an unexpected visit in prison from a stranger that would change her life. Brittany Byrd was still a law student when she stumbled upon Jones' case and began to research it. The daughter of an incarcerated mother, Byrd was moved to action. Soon, Byrd visited Jones, who at the time had no legal representation as all her appeals had been exhausted, and convinced her that she would take the case all the way to the White House if she had to, until Jones was a free woman.  I was like, you know, God you really sending someone to help me and from that day on, our vibes grew stronger and our belief grew together like this is gonna happen one day so we started working on the clemency, Jones said, describing how it felt to meet Byrd. But it wasn't until her mother died, one year away from her release, that Sharanda really set her mind on freedom. Jones recalls the last exchange she had with her mother. She said I gotta go out to the hospital and said 'I'll see you tomorrow'. The next day they called and said she had 24 hours to live and I didn't understand that. That was like all I knew at Carswell was to be with her, Jones said, crying. As soon as my mother passed I said I knew I'm going home. I scheduled my routine around her so, that's all I knew.  Getting Out, To date, Obama has granted 673 commutations, with 232 of those individuals initially serving life sentences. According to Neil Eggleston, White House counsel to the President, these individuals received unduly harsh sentences under outdated laws for committing largely nonviolent drug crimes.  And while recent drug sentencing reforms, such as former Attorney General Holder's Smart on Crime Initiative, which prioritizes federal prosecutor resources for the most serious offenses, keep many low level offenders from entering the overcrowded prison system, there was no retroactive mechanism to assist those already convicted.  The only possibility of freedom, they determined, would be a presidential pardon or commutation. Byrd would have to live up to the promise she made and get the Obama administration to pay attention to Sharanda's case. With the clemency petition filed, Byrd began a grassroots campaign to highlight what she saw as a major injustice in Jones' sentence.  One Monday in December 2015, Byrd heard rumors that Obama was scheduled to announce a round of pardons, commutations, and clemencies. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, nothing happened, Sharanda remembers. Then on Friday, the officer called me and told me to go to the back conference room and that just doesn't happen.  Jones waited alongside another inmate, both uncertain as to why they were being called in but remaining hopeful that their long shot bids for freedom had finally been granted. They began praying together before Jones was then escorted into yet another conference room where a phone call was waiting on her. It was Byrd, her attorney.  Brittany, is everything ok? Jones asked.  You're going home! Byrd screamed as Jones broke down in tears. But just as Jones had to adapt to prison life almost 17 years ago, she now must adapt to life on the outside and reconcile all the moments she's missed with her family. Since being released, Jones has found a job doing clerical work and is trying to rebuild her life while reconnecting with her daughter, Clenesha, who had been without her mother since the age of 8. And while Jones may have missed out on raising her own daughter, she feels she has been blessed with yet another second chance with the birth of her granddaughter three months ago.   Jones plans to use her voice to raise awareness for the need for criminal justice reform. I am so grateful for having a second chance at life but I left so many women behind who deserve the same mercy I was given, Jones said. I want to be done but I can't be done until more come home.

96,38570,57418,Refugees welcome: Sharing your home with a stranger,CNN,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) When hundreds of thousands of refugees began arriving in Berlin last summer, Manuela and Joerg Buisset abandoned plans to rent out their   basement, and instead offered it to refugees in need of shelter. Ahmed and Nourhan and their daughter Alin came to stay for 10 days, carrying all of their belongings in two small plastic bags. More than a year later, they and their new baby are now part of the Buisset family    though it hasn't all been easy. ”Ahmed was very insecure and shy, but we thought he was stubborn,” recalls Manuela. ”He wouldn't make eye contact with us, which we thought was so impolite, but he thought it was rude to make eye contact . .. He later told me he was just completely lost.” ”We are so happy here,” says Nourhan. Manuela went with Nourhan to all her medical appointments, and was at the hospital when baby Laith was born in July. ”At first I was scared,” admits Manuela, ”But we really, really like each other now.” Although they feel at home with the Buissets, the family longs to return to Al Quneitra in Syria    when peace talks were held last November, they began packing their bags in the hope they could go back. 'We packed whatever we could and ran' Architect Lars Asklund was so moved by the sight of thousands of refugees arriving in Sweden that he went to an immigration camp in his hometown of Malmo to try to help. While there, he met Waleed Lababdi. ”I asked him three questions: 'Are you married?' He said yes. 'Do you have kids?' He said no. I looked him straight in the eye and asked: 'Are you a fundamentalist?' He said no. I told him 'OK, I have a good proposal for you. '” Lababdi and his wife Farah Hilal moved in with Asklund in November 2015 Farah's brother Milad Hilal joined them last Christmas.  The trio had fled their home in Syria in 2012, first moving from place to place within the country and then, when a missile landed across the street, leaving the country for good. Now they have a new home with Asklund the four eat breakfast together every day, and gather for Swedish lessons at the kitchen table each week. ”He cares so much,” says Milad. ”He studies with me, even when he comes late at night. We are so lucky to have met him.” Asklund says he too has benefited from the arrangement: ”For me it's fun. It's fantastic, I have new friends and I really like them.” 'Integration is not   work' The Jellinek family is used to welcoming guests into their Berlin home for the weekly   Shabbat dinner, but now they have a regular    and somewhat unlikely    participant: Syrian Muslim Kinan. ”It's wonderful, because every Shabbat we meet new people,” says    Joshy. ”Kinan brings his friends and friends of our family come too.” Kinan, 28, from Damascus, has lived with the Jellineks since November 2015, and now feels at home enough to cook Syrian meals for the family.  ”We are both minorities in this country,” says Chaim. ”One thing we have in common is that our identities are very different from the majority in this society. ”Integration is not   work,” he says. ”[It] is not something that we should only ask from people coming into our country, we should ask this of ourselves too. We must accept different food, different culture, behavior.” 'To be completely helpless, that was the hardest thing' Wilhelm and Brian met Syrian refugee Inas on a train shortly after he arrived in Germany they struck up a conversation with the help of Google Translate, and swapped phone numbers at the end of their journey. Inas, who was staying in an emergency shelter, reached out to them for help and advice, and asked if he could use them as a local contact when filling in paperwork. His first   permit to stay in Germany listed Brian and Wilhelm's home as his legal address. ”It came as quite a surprise to us of course,” says Brian. ”At first we were completely unsure of all the implications, three months is a long time. But we talked with our friends and decided: let's do it!” The couple, who have been together for 25 years and married in 2011, were concerned about how he would react to their relationship. ”We knew we had to tell him we were gay,” Wilhelm says. ”So we showed him our wedding pictures. He shook our hands and said, 'No problem. '” Fashion designer Inas, who is originally from Damascus, had to leave behind his thriving wedding dress company when he left Syria, carrying just a few bags. He initially struggled in Berlin. ”Suddenly I was not a grown up man with a life anymore,” he says. ”I felt like a child. Brian and Wilhelm helped me with everything . .. To be completely helpless, that was the hardest thing.” Now he feels at home in the city, where he hopes to stay for good, and is working with a haute couture dressmaker. 'They gave me life again' Devout Muslim Ahmed and his teenage children Ali and Hiba were housed in a church when they first arrived in Malmo, Sweden after fleeing the civil war in Syria. ”They received us with so much love, compassion and care,” says Ahmed. ”They were angels.” Gabriella and Candel met the family while volunteering for charity Refugees Welcome they offered Ahmed a room in their house    but weren't sure how he'd react to their relationship. ”We told him we are married. He was very nice and polite but it all got very quiet,” recalls Gabriella. ”We thought he might change his mind.” The    was shocked, but says he is hugely grateful to them for taking his family in: ”I see how kind they are, I see their humanity, their love and kindness. They gave me life again.” Candel says she and Gabriella enjoy sharing their home, and that the arrangement is mutually beneficial: ”We get an extended family, we get to know about a new language, great food, and culture and they get a fast track into society.” 'We are all refugees' Berliners Claudia and Tobias grew up in the former East Germany, escaping to the West in the 1980s, and know only too well what it means to flee your home: ”At the end of the day, we are all refugees,” says Claudia. They became friends with Newruz, from Homs in Syria, when he was living in a refugee center in Meissen, Tobias's hometown, but had to wait nine months before he got his papers and was able to move to Berlin to stay with them. ”This arrangement means we are equals,” says Claudia. ”Sometimes I catch myself mothering him a little, because we have children that are his age, but we are really more like flatmates.” ”When we first told my father that Newruz would move in with us he smiled and his eyes sparkled,” Tobias says. ”I wasn't expecting such a positive reaction. He told us that . .. when he was a child, they had a refugee woman from Poland living with them for a while too. The only difference is that today they come from further afield.” Newruz, who is taking German lessons and hopes to train to be a nursery teacher, says Berlin feels like a home from home. ”Berlin and Homs are very similar,” he says. ”In terms of food, cycling around the streets . .. Meißen was very different, but Berlin is like my city and I have a few friends here now.” 'My neighbors have not been welcoming' Uta lives in Berlin's Marzahn district, she says her decision to take in Afghan refugee Hamid has not gone down well. ”My neighbours have not been the most welcoming,” she says, explaining that each time she adds Hamid's name to her mailbox, it has been removed, and that she has been told ”we don't want foreigners here.” Uta, who has two children of her own, is determined to make them change their minds. ”He's my son,” she told those who raised objections. ”You just have to get used to it.” But she says it has not come without a cost: ”I had to end friendships with people who didn't accept what I was doing. It was a shock to see how mean and   people can be.” Hamid goes to German classes and is working at an integration project where, he says: ”I really like to feel useful.” And for Uta, the arguments with neighbors have been worth it to have Hamid in her life: ”I've never learned so much in my life since having Hamid here, about religion, food, and other cultures.” 'Maybe we are setting a good example' Nawras Ahmadook's family took Valerie Schamberger into their home and looked after her when she was far from her native Austria, living in Aleppo, Syria to study Arabic. Ten years on, the Schambergers are returning the favor, welcoming Nawras, a former player on the Syrian national basketball team, to the small town of Bad Schallerbach. ”After everything I went through and everything I lost; my family, my friends, my country, my home, I really had nothing more to lose,” says Nawras. ”I was not afraid of getting on that dinghy boat and crossing the sea. Leaving Syria is not a choice.” When Valerie found out that Nawras had made it to Europe, she phoned her parents and asked them to help him. Her mother Martina drove to the border first thing the next morning. Now he's part of the family, Martina says. ”I feel like he is my son. He accepts me, a bit different than his mother, he opens up to me a lot, like a friend too.” ”People are looking at us closely,” she says. ”Maybe we are setting a good example.” 'It's magical. I can do what I like' Alqumit Alhamad fled his home in Raqqa, Syria, when ISIS took control. As a gay artist, he feared for his life: his friends were tortured by the militants, and homosexual men were thrown from buildings in the city. He traveled to Europe carrying a change of clothes, art supplies and his Lady Gaga, Bjork and Barbra Streisand CDs. ”Guards across Europe always looked at me weird when they searched my bag,” he says. ”But I don't care, I can't live without my music.” After arriving in Malmo, Sweden, in February this year, he met Linnea Tell, a single mother and librarian, who offered him a place to stay. ”I can't tell you how much my life changed and how free I feel,” he says. ”Every day I wake up and say 'Oh my God, I am in Sweden'. It's magical. I can say what I like, do what I like.  ”The people here, the support, the culture, the safety, it's a whole other world, especially for a gay person from the Arab world.” 'You have to take a stand somehow' Bilal Aljaber spent two years traveling from Syria to Germany, but by the time he got there, he wanted nothing more than to turn around and go home.  Then he met author and bookstore owner Edgar Rai and his wife Amelie. Rai jokes that it was ”love at first sight,” and after they got to know each other, the Rais offered Aljaber, 26, their spare room. ”They are like my second family,” Aljaber says. ”Anything they can help me with, they do it wholeheartedly. We have a very close friendship and this is one of the most beautiful things that has happened to me.  ”I feel I have someone here, someone supporting me, helping me,” he says. ”I am not all alone.” The Rai family has also taken Aljaber's brother Amr, 17, into their Berlin home. ”There is no way of pretending that this was not everybody's problem anymore,” Rai insists. ”You have to take a stand somehow.” 'He doesn't need us at all' Mouhanad Mourad fell in love with Vienna when he stopped for a much needed rest on his long journey from Damascus, Syria    via Libya    to Europe. After days on the road, he decided to stay and make the Austrian city his home. Determined to make it work, he helped in the kitchen of the refugee center, made friends and started learning German. Six months later, he moved out to live in a shared flat with Valerie Schamberger, Nora Katona and Roman Pable. And while his flatmates worried that he might need lots of help, they soon found out that Mouhanad, who founded his own support group, called Refugees for Refugees, was already settled. ”Mouhanad knows more people than we do,” says Valerie. ”His list of contacts is incredible and we didn't have to step in    he doesn't need us at all.”  ”He is standing on his own feet very well,” says Roman. ”We thought we might have to look after him like a younger brother but we didn't have to do anything. He's very orderly, very organized, a very German Syrian.” Changing lives    and minds, Nooria was abandoned by her husband when he found out she was pregnant. She says his decision to leave meant she could not stay in her hometown. ”A woman cannot live alone in Afghanistan and raise her own child without a man,” she says, explaining that she would have been forced to hand her daughter to her   . Nooria and Aysu, now two, fled the country and ended up in Austria, where they were introduced to mechanical engineer Sabine David. David and her husband Dominique offered the pair a place to stay in their picturesque hilltop home, close to the Slovenian border    despite the reservations of others. ”In the beginning, some people had concerns, telling us we cannot take in a stranger, that they will steal from us,” Sabine recalls. ”But then when they met Nooria they changed their minds. Now they say,'It's not the same with women and children. '” Nooria is busy finding her feet    and her independence    in her new home, where she is learning to ride a bike to get around. ”It makes me feel special,” she says. ”I am so happy with the bicycle and the freedom.” 'They are so full of surprises' Classmates Juan and Mohammed came to Germany from Damascus, Syria, in October 2015, following in the footsteps of Juan's brothers, Mzkin and Alan. Sabine Waldner and her twin daughters Charlotte and Miriam met the older pair while volunteering at a local refugee center, and offered Juan and Mohammed a place to stay. ”It's amazing how confident they have become since they've been here,” says Charlotte. ”They were so shy at the beginning. ”They are so full of surprises. We learn so much from each other and we enjoy ourselves. The other day, I taught Momo to ride a bicycle!” Juan and Mohammed have enrolled at the local high school, and since this photograph was taken, Charlotte and Miriam have moved out of the family home, allowing Mzkin and Alan to move in. 'I feel like I am living in heaven' When Margarethe Kramer offered a spare room in her home to a refugee, she was expecting a   woman with traditional views to move in.  ”But I was really surprised when I met Souad,” the kindergarten teacher says. ”She is so independent, so open minded, [so] modern.” Souad Awad, 49, a refugee from Iraq, has been living with Kramer in the Austrian border town of Lavanttal for just a few weeks, but already the pair are firm friends. ”I feel like I am living in heaven now,” Souad said. ”Margarethe is amazing    so sweet and her whole family is wonderful. I feel at home. I feel she's like my sister.” Kramer, 59, says she is pleased to have someone to keep her company while her husband is away working for much of the week. ”The whole experience enriched my life, with friendship and companionship,” she says.",False," (CNN) When hundreds of thousands of refugees began arriving in Berlin last summer, Manuela and Joerg Buisset abandoned plans to rent out their   basement, and instead offered it to refugees in need of shelter.

'My neighbors have not been welcoming' Uta lives in Berlin's Marzahn district, she says her decision to take in Afghan refugee Hamid has not gone down well. My neighbours have not been the most welcoming, she says, explaining that each time she adds Hamid's name to her mailbox, it has been removed, and that she has been told we don't want foreigners here. Uta, who has two children of her own, is determined to make them change their minds. He's my son, she told those who raised objections. You just have to get used to it. But she says it has not come without a cost: I had to end friendships with people who didn't accept what I was doing. It was a shock to see how mean and   people can be. Hamid goes to German classes and is working at an integration project where, he says: I really like to feel useful. And for Uta, the arguments with neighbors have been worth it to have Hamid in her life: I've never learned so much in my life since having Hamid here, about religion, food, and other cultures. 'Maybe we are setting a good example' Nawras Ahmadook's family took Valerie Schamberger into their home and looked after her when she was far from her native Austria, living in Aleppo, Syria to study Arabic. Ten years on, the Schambergers are returning the favor, welcoming Nawras, a former player on the Syrian national basketball team, to the small town of Bad Schallerbach. After everything I went through and everything I lost my family, my friends, my country, my home, I really had nothing more to lose, says Nawras. I was not afraid of getting on that dinghy boat and crossing the sea. Leaving Syria is not a choice. When Valerie found out that Nawras had made it to Europe, she phoned her parents and asked them to help him. Her mother Martina drove to the border first thing the next morning. Now he's part of the family, Martina says. I feel like he is my son. He accepts me, a bit different than his mother, he opens up to me a lot, like a friend too. People are looking at us closely, she says. Maybe we are setting a good example. 'It's magical. I can do what I like' Alqumit Alhamad fled his home in Raqqa, Syria, when ISIS took control. As a gay artist, he feared for his life: his friends were tortured by the militants, and homosexual men were thrown from buildings in the city. He traveled to Europe carrying a change of clothes, art supplies and his Lady Gaga, Bjork and Barbra Streisand CDs. Guards across Europe always looked at me weird when they searched my bag, he says. But I don't care, I can't live without my music. After arriving in Malmo, Sweden, in February this year, he met Linnea Tell, a single mother and librarian, who offered him a place to stay. I can't tell you how much my life changed and how free I feel, he says. Every day I wake up and say 'Oh my God, I am in Sweden'. It's magical. I can say what I like, do what I like.  The people here, the support, the culture, the safety, it's a whole other world, especially for a gay person from the Arab world. 'You have to take a stand somehow' Bilal Aljaber spent two years traveling from Syria to Germany, but by the time he got there, he wanted nothing more than to turn around and go home.  Then he met author and bookstore owner Edgar Rai and his wife Amelie. Rai jokes that it was love at first sight, and after they got to know each other, the Rais offered Aljaber, 26, their spare room. They are like my second family, Aljaber says. Anything they can help me with, they do it wholeheartedly. We have a very close friendship and this is one of the most beautiful things that has happened to me.  I feel I have someone here, someone supporting me, helping me, he says. I am not all alone. The Rai family has also taken Aljaber's brother Amr, 17, into their Berlin home. There is no way of pretending that this was not everybody's problem anymore, Rai insists. You have to take a stand somehow. 'He doesn't need us at all' Mouhanad Mourad fell in love with Vienna when he stopped for a much needed rest on his long journey from Damascus, Syria    via Libya    to Europe. After days on the road, he decided to stay and make the Austrian city his home. Determined to make it work, he helped in the kitchen of the refugee center, made friends and started learning German. Six months later, he moved out to live in a shared flat with Valerie Schamberger, Nora Katona and Roman Pable. And while his flatmates worried that he might need lots of help, they soon found out that Mouhanad, who founded his own support group, called Refugees for Refugees, was already settled. Mouhanad knows more people than we do, says Valerie. His list of contacts is incredible and we didn't have to step in    he doesn't need us at all.  He is standing on his own feet very well, says Roman. We thought we might have to look after him like a younger brother but we didn't have to do anything. He's very orderly, very organized, a very German Syrian. Changing lives    and minds, Nooria was abandoned by her husband when he found out she was pregnant. She says his decision to leave meant she could not stay in her hometown. A woman cannot live alone in Afghanistan and raise her own child without a man, she says, explaining that she would have been forced to hand her daughter to her   . Nooria and Aysu, now two, fled the country and ended up in Austria, where they were introduced to mechanical engineer Sabine David. David and her husband Dominique offered the pair a place to stay in their picturesque hilltop home, close to the Slovenian border    despite the reservations of others. In the beginning, some people had concerns, telling us we cannot take in a stranger, that they will steal from us, Sabine recalls. But then when they met Nooria they changed their minds. Now they say,'It's not the same with women and children. ' Nooria is busy finding her feet    and her independence    in her new home, where she is learning to ride a bike to get around. It makes me feel special, she says. I am so happy with the bicycle and the freedom. 'They are so full of surprises' Classmates Juan and Mohammed came to Germany from Damascus, Syria, in October 2015, following in the footsteps of Juan's brothers, Mzkin and Alan. Sabine Waldner and her twin daughters Charlotte and Miriam met the older pair while volunteering at a local refugee center, and offered Juan and Mohammed a place to stay. It's amazing how confident they have become since they've been here, says Charlotte. They were so shy at the beginning. They are so full of surprises. We learn so much from each other and we enjoy ourselves. The other day, I taught Momo to ride a bicycle! Juan and Mohammed have enrolled at the local high school, and since this photograph was taken, Charlotte and Miriam have moved out of the family home, allowing Mzkin and Alan to move in. 'I feel like I am living in heaven' When Margarethe Kramer offered a spare room in her home to a refugee, she was expecting a   woman with traditional views to move in.  But I was really surprised when I met Souad, the kindergarten teacher says. She is so independent, so open minded, [so] modern. Souad Awad, 49, a refugee from Iraq, has been living with Kramer in the Austrian border town of Lavanttal for just a few weeks, but already the pair are firm friends. I feel like I am living in heaven now, Souad said. Margarethe is amazing    so sweet and her whole family is wonderful. I feel at home. I feel she's like my sister. Kramer, 59, says she is pleased to have someone to keep her company while her husband is away working for much of the week. The whole experience enriched my life, with friendship and companionship, she says."
97,38593,57441,2 American climbers missing on Pakistan mountain,CNN,Faith Karimi,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,," (CNN) Improved weather conditions will allow helicopters to join the search Saturday for two American climbers missing after an attempt to scale one of the highest peaks in northern Pakistan, a family spokesman for one of the missing men said.  Kyle Dempster and Scott Adamson, from Utah, set out early August 21 to climb the north face of Ogre 2, near the Choktoi Glacier, authorities said.  The two men have not been seen since August 22, the day before a storm hit the mountain, according to a GoFundMe page set up to raise funds for their rescue.  A weather window opening up Saturday    the first break in the weather in 10 days    will allow Pakistani military helicopters to join the search, Jonathan Thesenga, a family spokesperson for Dempster, said in a statement. ”We have been in communication with the Pakistan military and they assure us that two Pakistani military helicopters will be starting the search,” he said. ”We owe a huge amount of gratitude to the Pakistan government for scrambling all of their available assets and their commitment to finding Scott and Kyle.”   climb planned, The climbers' initial plan included five days for the climb and descent, the Alpine Club of Pakistan said in a statement.  ”When they did not return on the expected date, the base camp team informed us. We then started communication with all concerned local authorities and the climbers' families.” Dempster is from Salt Lake City, Utah, while Adamson lives in nearby Provo, Utah. The two friends tried to summit the treacherous north face of Ogre 2 last year but turned back after Adamson fell and broke his leg, according to CNN affiliate KUTV. ”It's a remote area in Pakistan, not like you see with teams of people in the Himalayas,” said Thesenga.   The   peak sees intense snowstorms and bad weather this time of the year, complicating search efforts.  The government had previously not dispatched a rescue helicopter because of weather conditions, local official Muhammad Iqbal said.

113,56888,78169,‘Trust and Respect Are the Lifeblood of Frank Conversations',Atlantic,Bourree Lam,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Readers, staffers, and others from the University of Chicago community discuss Dean John Ellison's injunction against trigger warnings and safe spaces. If you have something to add, particularly as a professor, alumnus, or current student at the University of Chicago, please email hello@theatlantic. com. (A previous reader discussion on trigger warnings and campus politics is here.) This comment comes from alumnus Joel Avila, who lives in Chicago and works as a program manager at CVS Health. It's so good that I'm posting the whole thing (bolding is my own). Joel touches on one particular angle I've been thinking about a lot regarding the national coverage on campus politics: If the premise of good faith is important for academic freedom, then do letters such as Ellison's build or erode that trust between people who disagree with each other? From Joel: “Love your neighbor as yourself” seems like a decent rule from which university communities are trying to create some kind of secular analogue to address this controversy. To me much of the controversy is actually about trust and respect (and the lack thereof) among students, faculty, and administrators.   contemporary social problems (e. g. student debt, sexual discrimination, racial prejudice) are typically deliberated on campus in ways less encumbered than in society at large, for the simple reason that you have unstructured time to talk about them with lots of different people. Having said all this, I have little faith in trigger warnings and safe spaces, from which standpoint I would make a few observations and comments: 1. The letter itself strikes me as a broad type of trigger warning (a “  warning,” if you will). By telling incoming   that they don't support trigger warnings, they are implicitly telling —  dare I say “warning” —  students that certain conversations on campus may trouble them. By making this statement in the welcome letter, the college is getting the benefit of giving a general trigger warning while discouraging particular ones. 2. Your magazine's big cover story last year made quite an impression on me, especially in the way it raised the question about safe spaces and mental health. My wife is an outpatient clinical therapist (SSA '13) and she said that the piece articulated her question of whether safe spaces could stunt emotional  . What follows is a quote from her: “In therapy, it's really important to learn that you can't keep other people from offending you, but that you can control your response. To become a successful adult, you have to recognize that other people are coming from different experiences and won't see things the same way as you. It's fundamental to almost every therapy approach that you change your own reaction, rather than demanding that your environment accommodate you. ” 3. The controversy over trigger warnings and safe spaces seems to be a phenomenon specific to elite institutions. I wouldn't be surprised if   colleges and universities are also experiencing this in some form or another. But I'm not reading about protests at UConn, UCF, Kansas State, or Northern Michigan University. Instead I'm reading about tensions at U of C, Yale, and Oberlin. “Simple random samples” of college campuses these are not. 4. Because of #3, I guess I don't see the endpoint of this debate as it relates to the social problems in light of which it emerged. Basically, what's the payoff for instituting trigger warnings and building safe spaces at elite institutions? What's the payoff for banning the same? I think people on either side —  but especially the “pro” camp —  will be disappointed and disillusioned when the underlying socioeconomic morbidities linger or worsen despite their best efforts. Going back to one of my first points, I think trust and respect are the lifeblood of frank conversations —  for academic environments and pretty much any other relationships. When people at elite academic institutions can practice these two virtues (because that's what they are) I think we can listen to each other in good faith and admit hard truths to one another. Evil is real. Greed is real. Power corrupts. Trauma and abuse are ubiquitous. Racism and its roots are deeper and uglier than we want to admit. Shame is paralyzing. We all fear “the other” —  other races, other genders, other classes, etc. All of this is really, really hard to process, let alone to speak in public. As an    first year (and still today as a   !) I certainly failed at this constantly. But life is hard and full of failure too. But if academic elites strive to do a better job at admitting hardship and failure, and speaking their fears in trusting, respectful communities (read Brené Brown!) I think this controversy won't go away, but it might gradually subside. As the New Testament says elsewhere, “perfect love casts out fear. ” We'll see. When I was at the University of Chicago, I remember students protesting every week. It was just a thing that happened. My professors often covered very uncomfortable topics such as racism, colonialism, slavery —  I even remember a particularly heated discussion about female circumcision. Frantz Fanon's Black Face, White Masks was required reading for the Core I remember some students crying during a class covering that text and everyone was so supportive. I have never felt “unsafe” in these spaces on the other hand, I have always felt I could walk out. Nothing was ever personal we were always debating for intellectual pursuit. That's why I find Dean Ellison's letter puzzling. Maybe the fact that such a problematic letter felt necessary to reclaim that dynamic shows how much it's broken down —  that neither students nor administrators feel they can trust each other to speak on open and respectful terms. But I do know that respectful discussion is happening between alumni, and I am certain good faith has been fundamental to these insightful conversations. In fact, my favorite feedback of the week has been from a former classmate who I often disagreed with in class: “Really enjoy reading your pieces (even when I disagree with them). ” As we sifted through responses to the famed University of Chicago letter, we figured it'd be worth spotlighting what instructors feel about the whole thing. After all, they arguably understand the impact safe spaces and trigger warnings have on the classroom better than anyone else. Educators recognize the value of challenging students intellectually they know students should, at times, feel uncomfortable with the learning material. But they also know that absolutes are dangerous —  that sometimes safe spaces and trigger warnings are conducive, and not antithetical, to the robust, stimulating intellectual environment they seek. And at the end of the day, they don't like being told how to run their classroom. Here's what some current or former university instructors had to say: Andrew Dombrowski, a former university instructor who's now a counselor at the Berkeley Free Clinic, which he describes as a “    oriented”   collective: Safe spaces are really emphasized in our training process and I'm not going to lie, the letter took me aback at first. For us, just as a point of clarification, safe spaces involve establishing certain rules and expectations in a   manner, rather than excluding people from given backgrounds. Anyway, what I've come to realize is that when properly deployed, safe spaces can actually be actually very congruent to the values of open and rigorous intellectual inquiry —  it's less about shielding people from challenging ideas, and more about encouraging people to open up and explore challenging ideas in a *more* fearless way because they don't have to worry about irrelevant stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the ideas or content under discussion. I still don't feel like I speak the language of safe spaces natively —  I tend to couch these values to myself in terms like   inquiry and “being a decent human being” —  but I don't think there has to be ANY conflict with the academic values that I remain committed to even now that I don't work in academia. I don't doubt that there are people who abuse the concept of safe spaces in order to shut people down, but those people can be criticized without lapsing into the “grumble grumble grumble damn kids these days just want to be coddled stupid kids don't want to be exposed to new ideas” discourse that is WAY too prevalent in this conversation. I'm very disappointed in the letter, because one of the principles of basic intellectual good practice that I learned at UChicago is to engage with the strongest reasonable form of an argument you're opposed to, not to snarkily set up a   argument in hopes that it will go viral (and let's not kid ourselves, this was done with an eye to the outside world and external publicity). That's what really bothers me here I'm less invested in the ultimate policy decision and more profoundly disappointed by the lack of intellectual rigor and honesty involved in failing to reckon with the other side. An anonymous alum: Now that I'm on the other side of the classroom, I try to create as welcoming of an intellectual space as I can. In economics we talk about some difficult issues: the gender pay gap, consequences of inequality, effects of migration, consequence of job loss, social policies such as welfare and rent control. These have the potential to be sensitive issues for the reason that the things we discuss in my classroom may have consequentially affected my students' lives outside the classroom. I always try, though I do not always succeed, to ensure that everyone feels like their voice is respected. But I don't permit any idea to be a sacred cow. That is, students will have to tolerate that others might disagree with their opinion. I require that they find a way to disagree with someone while maintaining respect for them, hopefully by employing data and facts, and not resorting to Trumpisms such as ad hominem attacks. I care much more about the process through which students come to hold their beliefs —  and that throughout they maintain respect for others —  than in any particular beliefs they hold. I have two experiences from teaching at an elite liberal arts school where I was accused by students of crossing the safe space line. In the first instance, I was teaching at a women's college. Two male students from a nearby university attended, so the class was approximately 90 percent female. Both of the male students were engineering students, whereas none of the female students were. In class I referenced the entrepreneur Elon Musk and got mostly blank stares but some nods from the male students. As an aside to the two male engineering students, I mentioned one of his projects. A female student later came to my office hours that week to discuss the incident. She voiced that singling out the male students in the class made the rest of the class feel uncomfortable. I thanked her for her feedback and asked her to return again if she found anything upsetting in the future. While personally I thought the student may have been overly sensitive, I appreciated the feedback. I strive to create a welcoming environment, and if there's ways I can do that better I want to know. In contrast, the other incident was handled quite differently. I was lecturing on wage setting and made the slightly indelicate comment “the firm buys this worker” to mean that a firm hired a worker at a given wage. A student interrupted my lecture, saying, “You can't say that. They aren't slaves. ” I was taken aback. Was this student suggesting that I condoned slavery? No sooner had the comment left my mouth than I realized there was a better way of phrasing it, but I didn't think it required interruption. I stumbled through the next 10 minutes of my lecture before returning to myself. Had this student come to my office and mentioned the comment I would have apologized and professed to be more careful. I left class embarrassed and, if I were honest, resentful towards the student for the interruption, whose comment I never would have been audacious enough to raise as an undergraduate. What's missing from this debate is a guideline for dialogue between students and faculty about how we can create a more welcoming classroom environment. If we want to discuss meaningful topics, students risk feeling discomfort. However, U of C's “no safe space allowed” mantra only gets us half the way there. The other crucial element is knowing how to resolve incidents when students feel distressed. Another anonymous alum: 1. I am largely supportive of this letter in its context as a cover letter for a longer book, which is how it was sent out. A letter to incoming freshmen does not actually set university policy that's reserved for the handbook that no one reads. 2. Trigger warnings, safe spaces, and speaker censorship are all actually different issues. 3. I am largely against university “trigger warnings. ” The example that is usually used is of sexual assault survivors being triggered, which most decent people immediately agree with. I would propose the more ridiculous example of someone with extreme arachnophobia. Should an instructor teaching The Lord of the Rings have to say “Warning: Spiders?” If not, why not? Are some traumas more    than others? 4. I am very pro insightful contextualization before a piece of media. In film class, rather than “Warning: This film has rape,” a sensible and sensitive instructor might say “I want you to pay attention to how the stillness and position of the camera makes the audience complicit. ” 5. Students have the option of opting out of anything they want to. They just get penalized for it. 6. Students who have gone through the official steps of seeking accommodations (for dyslexia, ADD, PTSD, etc.) should be respected and accommodated. They are not a burden. Timothy   an associate professor of history at Rutgers: While I don't use trigger warnings in the classroom, I'd be appalled if an administrator at my own institution attempted to dictate to me or my students what they should expect from their instructors with regard to such warnings. It would abrogate my academic freedom as an instructor. In this context, Ellison's words cruelly ignore the recent and devastating history of indifference by University of Chicago administrators to marginalized students' safety. I think the University of Chicago has a fetish of the universal and a hostility toward concepts or ideas that can be construed as “particular. ” (For example, as a graduate student there, I taught a course that at most other institutions would be called “Introduction to LGBT Studies” at Chicago, it is, or at least was, called “Problems in the Study of Sexuality. ”) There is a concomitant sense that the heroic individual scholar can and should engage in the life of the mind, without being embedded in the messy realities of the real world. In its most troubling versions, this leads to a sense on the part of administrators that discrimination and structural oppression can be wished or willed away, or that catering to demands for inclusion would somehow be “coddling. ” This letter about trigger warnings  safe spaces? In my view, it's not at all motivated by actual concern about TWs and safe spaces. Continuing our series of comments from the University of Chicago community regarding Dean John Ellison's letter, some alumni and students have expressed that the move smelled, at least partially, like a publicity stunt. From one current University of Chicago student, who hints that the administration has been trying to change the image of those beloved strange “dark” days of the school I remember so well: To me, the whole situation reads as a poorly conceived publicity stunt. The University is in this strange moment where its undergrad exclusivity has recently shot up, and it seems to want to do everything it can to bolster its reputation. The College also attempting to rebrand through ditching the    masochism tone of prior decades and attempting to court a reputation of Fun, Exciting Academic Rigor. However, this all leaves the College without a coherent identity, and the admins pinned their hopes on riding the   wave of think pieces on the matter, which would allow them to capitalize on dissatisfaction with the Millennial bogeyman's perceived censorship problem, hostility toward the ivory tower, and the massive moderate frustrated by youth movements in general. It certainly doesn't represent any actual policy change: the University has explicitly said that this is not a blanket ban on trigger warnings, but that it still allows professors to choose what to do at their discretion. I have no idea whether it worked. It will have appealed to those forces I mentioned, but of course will also drive away prospective students involved in the   community. From another alum: Have you ever actually had a lesson plan or discussion section disrupted because students claimed they felt “triggered” by the material? Sometimes I find the language and the logic of the “trigger warning” a bit stultifying, but really that's only in the abstract because no one has ever actually invoked it. I can count the number of times a student has asked to take a step back from a set of readings or a specific conversation on one hand, and then it's with ample, generous explanation and always when we were dealing with genuinely disturbing material. I suppose this letter disappoints me because it reads like fairly blatant administrative grandstanding. More insidiously, I am afraid that it will produce the very effects that it claims it is trying to prevent —  the foreclosure of a dialogue between all interested parties. And lastly, an alum questions whether the letter is speaking to the university's community and how consistent the university's administration has been on the issue: I find the letter from U of C to be somewhat embarrassing. On the surface, who can argue with academic freedom? But I take the appeal to it here to be fairly empty posturing and, more importantly, it's part of a pattern of the administration appealing to academic freedom at the same time as —  or in order to —  act badly. When I was an undergrad they were refusing to divest from Darfur because taking a political stance would somehow violate academic freedom. It seemed to me at the time to be a fairly transparent attempt to preserve the status quo and avoid a financial hassle —  and I'm skeptical that divestment was in any way contrary to the famous Kalven Report. And we can add to this the University's treatment of protesters, including those who were agitating for a trauma unit at the hospitals and the more recent threats against the student body president who organized a  . Throw in the   letter that the president just sent, too. Appealing to academic freedom while acting this way may not be acting inconsistently, exactly, but it isn't great. What I take away from all of this is that the administrators don't care about academic freedom. They care about their  . And their interest is in propping up the speech of some and not others. In making their decisions, I have a hard time imagining these administrators sitting around thinking carefully about the meaning of academic freedom in all of its complexity and nuance. That kind of pondering was what my professors taught me at U of C. What I read is a letter with all the nuance and care of a talk radio host. I'm confident that Chicago will continue being a great school with incredible faculty and students doing amazing things. This letter contributes nothing to the quality of the institution —  nor does it detract from it. It's a shadow on the wall of the cave. I wish it had been something worth our time, because these issues do matter. I don't think that trigger warnings and safe spaces are inconsistent with academic freedom —  not in the least. But I don't think that this is about that —  it's just an attempt at branding, as well as ignoring or silencing or marginalizing protest at the University. It sets up those that want the University to act as a better citizen (with respect to its students and the broader community) as  . And while those that protest very well might be wrong —  that's debatable, for sure —  I think the   slant is an insubstantial smear. If we're going to have a   conversation about trigger warnings and safe spaces, then fine. The Dean should write the kind of reasoned, deep treatment of the issues that the U of C community deserves. Yesterday, my colleague, Bourree Lam, looked at how University of Chicago alumni are responding to the   letter their alma mater sent out last week to incoming freshmen. The letter essentially warned students that the university —  which for decades has espoused its commitment to “freedom of expression” —  would not tolerate “intellectual ‘safe spaces'” and “  ‘trigger warnings. '” The thinking behind the letter, presumably, is that safe spaces and trigger warnings inherently suppress free speech and academic freedom —  and, in turn, that the university felt a need to defend those values. As Bourree highlighted yesterday, that premise outraged many alumni, who remember their years at the university as experiences rife with challenging and uncomfortable discussions. Others argued that the wholesale rejection of things like trigger warnings misses the point. It got us thinking: What is a trigger warning, anyway? What defines a safe space? Lots of people have questioned whether Dean of Students John Ellison, who wrote the letter, actually understands what the terms mean. My colleague, Conor Friedersdorf, chimed in on the topic this morning. Here's what some from the academic community had to say. From an alum, Audrey Truschke: I would say that the letter brought up mixed reactions from me. I wholeheartedly support the basic idea that universities ought to have a strong, unflinching commitment to academic freedom of speech, and I think numerous institutions have dangerously compromised that ideal recently. That said, I use trigger warnings periodically on syllabi. I started including them formally, as part of the written syllabus, last year when I realized that I had been doing them informally for years. For me, it always seemed to be common sense that when you find yourself, say, assigning a graphic description of rape, you might give your students a   during the prior class meeting, concerning what they are about to read. Even now, I often issue ”trigger warnings” more informally. For instance, this past spring I sent out a podcast on female genital mutilation to my students with the caveat that they should not listen to it while driving. I had made that mistake, I told them, and nearly had to pull over at one point because it was such a hard listen and brought tears to my eyes. The point of giving due warning, for me, is not to silence debate but rather to prepare people so that they can (hopefully) move beyond their understandable initial reactions of shock, horror, disgust, and trauma and enter into an intellectual discussion of the materials and questions at hand. From another alum, Nabeel Ebeid: More than anything, I'm embarrassed. UChicago taught me to question so many assumptions and helped me to revise so many of my priors with logic and data. For the school to send its undergrads a letter without a clear definition of “safe space” or “trigger warning,” without any reference to sexual assault, harassment, or the contexts in which these words emerged, and without substantiating any link between those terms and academic freedom, Ellison is being lazy at best and, at worst, gratuitously malicious. One need not denigrate safe spaces or trigger warnings to support academic freedom or defend the right to bring controversial speakers to campus. More puzzling is that the school is full of safe spaces: the Center for Identity and Inclusion (Amandla Center in my day) worship groups, any number of campus affinity groups, etc (to say nothing of health counselors' offices). The school appears to endorse them wholeheartedly, and it's hard to imagine a day when it wouldn't. These spaces have provided both vibrant fora for   discussion as well as support systems for the marginalized. In my time at UChicago, they contributed to campus conversation with a wide array of speakers and perspectives that were often underrepresented in the Core. I can't recall a single instance in which these communities stifled free speech. The aversion to trigger warnings seems even stranger. Trigger warnings by definition prepare the reader or listener for triggering content the notion that these warnings stifle speech is unsubstantiated and farfetched. I also wonder how taking a stance against trigger warnings doesn't stifle the free speech of professors who may see value in sensitivity when introducing potentially triggering material. Finally, I wonder what kind of message a note like this sends to community members who may already be wary from recent Title IX investigations. Ellison seems to be reacting viscerally to the feeling that the marginalized have it too easy. If he was concerned about disinviting speakers, he could have said as much. Instead, he chose to bash vaguely   terms without appearing to understand them, and he strung them together into a paragraph of non sequiturs . .. all in the name of freedom. From another alum, Maira Khwaja, who graduated this past June: Dean Ellison misrepresents what trigger warnings and safe spaces have been on our campus, which are often nuanced and personalized for each professor (UChicago is nothing if not nuanced and overly verbose) and syllabi and department and extracurricular. His simplification, misrepresentation, and conflation of trigger     speakers are poor examples of the “rigorous discourse” that he boasts. In our histories of violence class, we did not shy away from any of America's most brutal understudied history, but we were given a thoughtful paragraph on the syllabus about the nature of the images and text we'd read in the archive. It'd be naive and foolish to disregard that thoughtful paragraph from our professor as something other than analysis that contributed to class discussion and understanding. Safe spaces are not made so that students can “retreat” from ideas they don't want to hear in fact, often safe spaces are built in our campus so that they can dive even further, with careful support (like support staff on hand, or respectful mutually made ground rules created) into discussions that would often be too uncomfortable for the classroom. An anonymous alum: I'm very disappointed in this admin at my former school over his nonsense about trigger warnings destroying freedom. And I love that it's a scholar at my current one so splendidly calling him out: As CUNY historian Angus Johnston notes, “There's no college in the country where profs are required to give trigger warnings. They're all voluntary pedagogical choices. Which means a professor's use of trigger warnings isn't a threat to academic freedom. It's a MANIFESTATION of academic freedom. '” Academic freedom means that professors get to design their syllabus, not administrators like Ellison. His letter is a prime example of how the outcry against “political correctness” often leads to policy changes that limit free speech.” Over the past week, my alma mater has been all over my (and probably your) news feed. The general dramatic headline: There will not be safe spaces or trigger warnings at the University of Chicago, according to a letter sent by John Ellison, dean of students at the university, to incoming freshmen. The letter immediately became a dot on the timeline of the ongoing national debate on campus politics, political correctness, and academic freedom —  the media narrative being that an administration takes a stand on free speech and academic freedom, and that's followed swiftly by support and pushback from students, experts, and pundits. I went to the University of Chicago for undergrad in the early 2000s. I studied economics and sociology, and I have very fond memories of the school's peculiar culture: the way students laughed off the bitter winters, the way pulling   at the library (shoutout to the  ) was cool, the super weird school traditions like Scavhunt —  so strange that The NYer once devoted nearly 4, 000 words to it. It's a place where people knowingly enrolled even though they've been told it's a place “where fun comes to die. ” I think we took pride in the image that we were young people who wanted to participate in school that was intellectually rigorous (the “life of the mind”) where a class about Nabokov's Lolita or Foucault's History of Sexuality were so popular it was hard to find a seat, where education was its own end, and everyone was a bit odd in their own way. I think my peers and I worried that culture (beloved by us) was starting to fade when I graduated in 2007: The school had switched from the UnCommon App to the Common App. The school started to rise in rankings, which was favorable for alumni   but we worried that it was at the cost of the school's identity and the students it would attract. The University of Chicago is about hard classes, but it's also about community.   In NY, where I live now, alumni are often   friend groups —  my    spouse regularly laments that he knows more alumni from the U of C than his own university —  that meet up regularly to have discussions not dissimilar to classes. (It's also interesting to note that some 20 percent of U of C alumni end up in academia.) With Ellison's letter, we all pondered what it's going to mean, and we did that together online. This week, I'm going to highlight some of the interesting discussions I've seen on social media and responses from the University of Chicago community. My colleague Alia Wong will join me in discussing these comments from students and alumni who share deep connections to the school and each other. For them, Ellison's letter is personal, in contrast to the way the national debate on campus politics can sometimes feel removed. From one alum, Laura Oppenheimer: I take an inordinate amount of pride in how hard I worked as a student at the U of C. My courses were not dumbed down, no one held my hand, and I was expected to read, grapple with, and discuss everything —  ranging from Plato and Marx, to Four Hours in My Lai and Night. The reading was difficult, and frequently, so was the subject matter. What I wish Ellison had said was, “as students at the University of Chicago, you will be expected to read, study and discuss many types of work, including work that may be upsetting, or work you may disagree with. This is part of a rigorous, academic education. ” Instead, he issued a blanket statement that the school doesn't give trigger warnings, which are something that serve to protect those who may have PTSD due to past trauma. To me, despite the way trigger warnings have been   by overly sensitive college students, this was a misstep. I applaud the ethos, but I wish the administration had refined the message and made it about free speech and academic discourse, focusing more on the message it was trying to deliver, and less on grabbing a moment in the spotlight. From another alum: As a 2006 graduate, I have to say I completely support Ellison's letter 100 percent.  It really surprised me a lot because I didn't expect the University to go that far in support of true free speech, since free speech is not very popular these days, especially on college campuses.  But I am very glad (and proud) that the University took such a position.  I hope that they stick to it.  (Though as an aside, I also wonder how many people are hearing about the University for the very first time because of this letter —  and to what extent that is a good thing or a bad thing.) A particularly insightful Facebook post from alum Nasia Anam: I don't think it would be a stretch to call University of Chicago a school of intellectual hard knocks. This has always been the unarticulated social contract of matriculating at U of C —  the place that attracts kids who proudly don   emblazoned with the motto “Where Fun Comes to Die,” and [where] the   winter break is unofficially known as “Suicide Prevention Day. ”   …     But a wholesale dismissal of “trigger warnings” and “safe spaces” as flimsy excuses for coddled millennials to continue lives of comfort, puppies, and   (not Plato!   to) is simultaneously a refusal to acknowledge an extremely problematic stance on student mental health. Clinical depression is not a prerequisite in the life of the mind, and being   by class material does not facilitate “freedom of inquiry and expression” but, quite to the contrary, precludes and damages a fruitful learning process. To make students uncomfortable, to create friction and tension in the classroom, lecture hall, auditorium, etc. —  these are invaluable pedagogical tools. Asking students to exacerbate existing pain, trauma, or mental disturbance or enter spaces where they feel endangered or ashamed does absolutely nothing for the honorable pursuit of  . . .. My problem with the letter is not that it raises the issues of “trigger warnings” and “safe spaces” as dubious, but the unnecessarily harsh tone it takes. There is an underlying   assumption that incoming freshmen (legal adults, I might add) will not be able, of their own accord, to determine what may or may not be traumatic for them. Traumatic. Not disturbing, not unsettling. Traumatic. Trauma is a   psychological condition, and the fact that the letter gives it absolutely no credence gives the impression to incoming undergraduates that their mental health is not an issue that needs or warrants any attention whatsoever.   …     We should put pressure upon the concept of “trigger warnings” and “safe spaces,” yes. We should be vigilant about the ways these accommodative practices are abused. But to completely dismiss these pedagogical caveats as   psychobabble hooha is not only retrograde, it is contra to the aims of an administration that ostensibly seeks a more diverse population of students. Free expression and inquiry can by its very nature only occur in spaces where all individuals understand themselves to be equally free. Hostile and punitive classroom environments do not facilitate this goal. We should be debating and complicating the ideas of “trigger warnings” and ”safe spaces,” not dismissing them. If you're a former or current student at the University of Chicago with an opinion on Ellison's letter, or you disagree with some of the points that I've included here, please send a note to hello@theatlantic. com.         ",False,"Readers, staffers, and others from the University of Chicago community discuss Dean John Ellison's injunction against trigger warnings and safe spaces. If you have something to add, particularly as a professor, alumnus, or current student at the University of Chicago, please email hello@theatlantic. com. (A previous reader discussion on trigger warnings and campus politics is here.) This comment comes from alumnus Joel Avila, who lives in Chicago and works as a program manager at CVS Health. It's so good that I'm posting the whole thing (bolding is my own). Joel touches on one particular angle I've been thinking about a lot regarding the national coverage on campus politics: If the premise of good faith is important for academic freedom, then do letters such as Ellison's build or erode that trust between people who disagree with each other? From Joel: Love your neighbor as yourself seems like a decent rule from which university communities are trying to create some kind of secular analogue to address this controversy. To me much of the controversy is actually about trust and respect (and the lack thereof) among students, faculty, and administrators.   contemporary social problems (e. g. student debt, sexual discrimination, racial prejudice) are typically deliberated on campus in ways less encumbered than in society at large, for the simple reason that you have unstructured time to talk about them with lots of different people. Having said all this, I have little faith in trigger warnings and safe spaces, from which standpoint I would make a few observations and comments: 1. The letter itself strikes me as a broad type of trigger warning (a   warning, if you will). By telling incoming   that they don't support trigger warnings, they are implicitly telling   dare I say warning   students that certain conversations on campus may trouble them. By making this statement in the welcome letter, the college is getting the benefit of giving a general trigger warning while discouraging particular ones. 2. Your magazine's big cover story last year made quite an impression on me, especially in the way it raised the question about safe spaces and mental health. My wife is an outpatient clinical therapist (SSA '13) and she said that the piece articulated her question of whether safe spaces could stunt emotional  . What follows is a quote from her: In therapy, it's really important to learn that you can't keep other people from offending you, but that you can control your response. To become a successful adult, you have to recognize that other people are coming from different experiences and won't see things the same way as you. It's fundamental to almost every therapy approach that you change your own reaction, rather than demanding that your environment accommodate you.  3. The controversy over trigger warnings and safe spaces seems to be a phenomenon specific to elite institutions. I wouldn't be surprised if   colleges and universities are also experiencing this in some form or another. But I'm not reading about protests at UConn, UCF, Kansas State, or Northern Michigan University. Instead I'm reading about tensions at U of C, Yale, and Oberlin. Simple random samples of college campuses these are not. 4. Because of #3, I guess I don't see the endpoint of this debate as it relates to the social problems in light of which it emerged. Basically, what's the payoff for instituting trigger warnings and building safe spaces at elite institutions? What's the payoff for banning the same? I think people on either side   but especially the pro camp   will be disappointed and disillusioned when the underlying socioeconomic morbidities linger or worsen despite their best efforts. Going back to one of my first points, I think trust and respect are the lifeblood of frank conversations   for academic environments and pretty much any other relationships. When people at elite academic institutions can practice these two virtues (because that's what they are) I think we can listen to each other in good faith and admit hard truths to one another. Evil is real. Greed is real. Power corrupts. Trauma and abuse are ubiquitous. Racism and its roots are deeper and uglier than we want to admit. Shame is paralyzing. We all fear the other   other races, other genders, other classes, etc. All of this is really, really hard to process, let alone to speak in public. As an    first year (and still today as a   !) I certainly failed at this constantly. But life is hard and full of failure too. But if academic elites strive to do a better job at admitting hardship and failure, and speaking their fears in trusting, respectful communities (read Bren Brown!) I think this controversy won't go away, but it might gradually subside. As the New Testament says elsewhere, perfect love casts out fear.  We'll see. When I was at the University of Chicago, I remember students protesting every week. It was just a thing that happened. My professors often covered very uncomfortable topics such as racism, colonialism, slavery   I even remember a particularly heated discussion about female circumcision. Frantz Fanon's Black Face, White Masks was required reading for the Core I remember some students crying during a class covering that text and everyone was so supportive. I have never felt unsafe in these spaces on the other hand, I have always felt I could walk out. Nothing was ever personal we were always debating for intellectual pursuit. That's why I find Dean Ellison's letter puzzling. Maybe the fact that such a problematic letter felt necessary to reclaim that dynamic shows how much it's broken down   that neither students nor administrators feel they can trust each other to speak on open and respectful terms. But I do know that respectful discussion is happening between alumni, and I am certain good faith has been fundamental to these insightful conversations. In fact, my favorite feedback of the week has been from a former classmate who I often disagreed with in class: Really enjoy reading your pieces (even when I disagree with them).  As we sifted through responses to the famed University of Chicago letter, we figured it'd be worth spotlighting what instructors feel about the whole thing. After all, they arguably understand the impact safe spaces and trigger warnings have on the classroom better than anyone else. Educators recognize the value of challenging students intellectually they know students should, at times, feel uncomfortable with the learning material. But they also know that absolutes are dangerous   that sometimes safe spaces and trigger warnings are conducive, and not antithetical, to the robust, stimulating intellectual environment they seek. And at the end of the day, they don't like being told how to run their classroom. Here's what some current or former university instructors had to say: Andrew Dombrowski, a former university instructor who's now a counselor at the Berkeley Free Clinic, which he describes as a     oriented   collective: Safe spaces are really emphasized in our training process and I'm not going to lie, the letter took me aback at first. For us, just as a point of clarification, safe spaces involve establishing certain rules and expectations in a   manner, rather than excluding people from given backgrounds. Anyway, what I've come to realize is that when properly deployed, safe spaces can actually be actually very congruent to the values of open and rigorous intellectual inquiry   it's less about shielding people from challenging ideas, and more about encouraging people to open up and explore challenging ideas in a *more* fearless way because they don't have to worry about irrelevant stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the ideas or content under discussion. I still don't feel like I speak the language of safe spaces natively   I tend to couch these values to myself in terms like   inquiry and being a decent human being   but I don't think there has to be ANY conflict with the academic values that I remain committed to even now that I don't work in academia. I don't doubt that there are people who abuse the concept of safe spaces in order to shut people down, but those people can be criticized without lapsing into the grumble grumble grumble damn kids these days just want to be coddled stupid kids don't want to be exposed to new ideas discourse that is WAY too prevalent in this conversation. I'm very disappointed in the letter, because one of the principles of basic intellectual good practice that I learned at UChicago is to engage with the strongest reasonable form of an argument you're opposed to, not to snarkily set up a   argument in hopes that it will go viral (and let's not kid ourselves, this was done with an eye to the outside world and external publicity). That's what really bothers me here I'm less invested in the ultimate policy decision and more profoundly disappointed by the lack of intellectual rigor and honesty involved in failing to reckon with the other side. An anonymous alum: Now that I'm on the other side of the classroom, I try to create as welcoming of an intellectual space as I can. In economics we talk about some difficult issues: the gender pay gap, consequences of inequality, effects of migration, consequence of job loss, social policies such as welfare and rent control. These have the potential to be sensitive issues for the reason that the things we discuss in my classroom may have consequentially affected my students' lives outside the classroom. I always try, though I do not always succeed, to ensure that everyone feels like their voice is respected. But I don't permit any idea to be a sacred cow. That is, students will have to tolerate that others might disagree with their opinion. I require that they find a way to disagree with someone while maintaining respect for them, hopefully by employing data and facts, and not resorting to Trumpisms such as ad hominem attacks. I care much more about the process through which students come to hold their beliefs   and that throughout they maintain respect for others   than in any particular beliefs they hold. I have two experiences from teaching at an elite liberal arts school where I was accused by students of crossing the safe space line. In the first instance, I was teaching at a women's college. Two male students from a nearby university attended, so the class was approximately 90 percent female. Both of the male students were engineering students, whereas none of the female students were. In class I referenced the entrepreneur Elon Musk and got mostly blank stares but some nods from the male students. As an aside to the two male engineering students, I mentioned one of his projects. A female student later came to my office hours that week to discuss the incident. She voiced that singling out the male students in the class made the rest of the class feel uncomfortable. I thanked her for her feedback and asked her to return again if she found anything upsetting in the future. While personally I thought the student may have been overly sensitive, I appreciated the feedback. I strive to create a welcoming environment, and if there's ways I can do that better I want to know. In contrast, the other incident was handled quite differently. I was lecturing on wage setting and made the slightly indelicate comment the firm buys this worker to mean that a firm hired a worker at a given wage. A student interrupted my lecture, saying, You can't say that. They aren't slaves.  I was taken aback. Was this student suggesting that I condoned slavery? No sooner had the comment left my mouth than I realized there was a better way of phrasing it, but I didn't think it required interruption. I stumbled through the next 10 minutes of my lecture before returning to myself. Had this student come to my office and mentioned the comment I would have apologized and professed to be more careful. I left class embarrassed and, if I were honest, resentful towards the student for the interruption, whose comment I never would have been audacious enough to raise as an undergraduate. What's missing from this debate is a guideline for dialogue between students and faculty about how we can create a more welcoming classroom environment. If we want to discuss meaningful topics, students risk feeling discomfort. However, U of C's no safe space allowed mantra only gets us half the way there. The other crucial element is knowing how to resolve incidents when students feel distressed. Another anonymous alum: 1. I am largely supportive of this letter in its context as a cover letter for a longer book, which is how it was sent out. A letter to incoming freshmen does not actually set university policy that's reserved for the handbook that no one reads. 2. Trigger warnings, safe spaces, and speaker censorship are all actually different issues. 3. I am largely against university trigger warnings.  The example that is usually used is of sexual assault survivors being triggered, which most decent people immediately agree with. I would propose the more ridiculous example of someone with extreme arachnophobia. Should an instructor teaching The Lord of the Rings have to say Warning: Spiders? If not, why not? Are some traumas more    than others? 4. I am very pro insightful contextualization before a piece of media. In film class, rather than Warning: This film has rape, a sensible and sensitive instructor might say I want you to pay attention to how the stillness and position of the camera makes the audience complicit.  5. Students have the option of opting out of anything they want to. They just get penalized for it. 6. Students who have gone through the official steps of seeking accommodations (for dyslexia, ADD, PTSD, etc.) should be respected and accommodated. They are not a burden. Timothy   an associate professor of history at Rutgers: While I don't use trigger warnings in the classroom, I'd be appalled if an administrator at my own institution attempted to dictate to me or my students what they should expect from their instructors with regard to such warnings. It would abrogate my academic freedom as an instructor. In this context, Ellison's words cruelly ignore the recent and devastating history of indifference by University of Chicago administrators to marginalized students' safety. I think the University of Chicago has a fetish of the universal and a hostility toward concepts or ideas that can be construed as particular.  (For example, as a graduate student there, I taught a course that at most other institutions would be called Introduction to LGBT Studies at Chicago, it is, or at least was, called Problems in the Study of Sexuality. ) There is a concomitant sense that the heroic individual scholar can and should engage in the life of the mind, without being embedded in the messy realities of the real world. In its most troubling versions, this leads to a sense on the part of administrators that discrimination and structural oppression can be wished or willed away, or that catering to demands for inclusion would somehow be coddling.  This letter about trigger warnings  safe spaces? In my view, it's not at all motivated by actual concern about TWs and safe spaces. Continuing our series of comments from the University of Chicago community regarding Dean John Ellison's letter, some alumni and students have expressed that the move smelled, at least partially, like a publicity stunt. From one current University of Chicago student, who hints that the administration has been trying to change the image of those beloved strange dark days of the school I remember so well: To me, the whole situation reads as a poorly conceived publicity stunt. The University is in this strange moment where its undergrad exclusivity has recently shot up, and it seems to want to do everything it can to bolster its reputation. The College also attempting to rebrand through ditching the    masochism tone of prior decades and attempting to court a reputation of Fun, Exciting Academic Rigor. However, this all leaves the College without a coherent identity, and the admins pinned their hopes on riding the   wave of think pieces on the matter, which would allow them to capitalize on dissatisfaction with the Millennial bogeyman's perceived censorship problem, hostility toward the ivory tower, and the massive moderate frustrated by youth movements in general. It certainly doesn't represent any actual policy change: the University has explicitly said that this is not a blanket ban on trigger warnings, but that it still allows professors to choose what to do at their discretion. I have no idea whether it worked. It will have appealed to those forces I mentioned, but of course will also drive away prospective students involved in the   community. From another alum: Have you ever actually had a lesson plan or discussion section disrupted because students claimed they felt triggered by the material? Sometimes I find the language and the logic of the trigger warning a bit stultifying, but really that's only in the abstract because no one has ever actually invoked it. I can count the number of times a student has asked to take a step back from a set of readings or a specific conversation on one hand, and then it's with ample, generous explanation and always when we were dealing with genuinely disturbing material. I suppose this letter disappoints me because it reads like fairly blatant administrative grandstanding. More insidiously, I am afraid that it will produce the very effects that it claims it is trying to prevent   the foreclosure of a dialogue between all interested parties. And lastly, an alum questions whether the letter is speaking to the university's community and how consistent the university's administration has been on the issue: I find the letter from U of C to be somewhat embarrassing. On the surface, who can argue with academic freedom? But I take the appeal to it here to be fairly empty posturing and, more importantly, it's part of a pattern of the administration appealing to academic freedom at the same time as   or in order to   act badly. When I was an undergrad they were refusing to divest from Darfur because taking a political stance would somehow violate academic freedom. It seemed to me at the time to be a fairly transparent attempt to preserve the status quo and avoid a financial hassle   and I'm skeptical that divestment was in any way contrary to the famous Kalven Report. And we can add to this the University's treatment of protesters, including those who were agitating for a trauma unit at the hospitals and the more recent threats against the student body president who organized a  . Throw in the   letter that the president just sent, too. Appealing to academic freedom while acting this way may not be acting inconsistently, exactly, but it isn't great. What I take away from all of this is that the administrators don't care about academic freedom. They care about their  . And their interest is in propping up the speech of some and not others. In making their decisions, I have a hard time imagining these administrators sitting around thinking carefully about the meaning of academic freedom in all of its complexity and nuance. That kind of pondering was what my professors taught me at U of C. What I read is a letter with all the nuance and care of a talk radio host. I'm confident that Chicago will continue being a great school with incredible faculty and students doing amazing things. This letter contributes nothing to the quality of the institution   nor does it detract from it. It's a shadow on the wall of the cave. I wish it had been something worth our time, because these issues do matter. I don't think that trigger warnings and safe spaces are inconsistent with academic freedom   not in the least. But I don't think that this is about that   it's just an attempt at branding, as well as ignoring or silencing or marginalizing protest at the University. It sets up those that want the University to act as a better citizen (with respect to its students and the broader community) as  . And while those that protest very well might be wrong   that's debatable, for sure   I think the   slant is an insubstantial smear. If we're going to have a   conversation about trigger warnings and safe spaces, then fine. The Dean should write the kind of reasoned, deep treatment of the issues that the U of C community deserves. Yesterday, my colleague, Bourree Lam, looked at how University of Chicago alumni are responding to the   letter their alma mater sent out last week to incoming freshmen. The letter essentially warned students that the university   which for decades has espoused its commitment to freedom of expression   would not tolerate intellectual safe spaces' and   trigger warnings. ' The thinking behind the letter, presumably, is that safe spaces and trigger warnings inherently suppress free speech and academic freedom   and, in turn, that the university felt a need to defend those values. As Bourree highlighted yesterday, that premise outraged many alumni, who remember their years at the university as experiences rife with challenging and uncomfortable discussions. Others argued that the wholesale rejection of things like trigger warnings misses the point. It got us thinking: What is a trigger warning, anyway? What defines a safe space? Lots of people have questioned whether Dean of Students John Ellison, who wrote the letter, actually understands what the terms mean. My colleague, Conor Friedersdorf, chimed in on the topic this morning. Here's what some from the academic community had to say. From an alum, Audrey Truschke: I would say that the letter brought up mixed reactions from me. I wholeheartedly support the basic idea that universities ought to have a strong, unflinching commitment to academic freedom of speech, and I think numerous institutions have dangerously compromised that ideal recently. That said, I use trigger warnings periodically on syllabi. I started including them formally, as part of the written syllabus, last year when I realized that I had been doing them informally for years. For me, it always seemed to be common sense that when you find yourself, say, assigning a graphic description of rape, you might give your students a   during the prior class meeting, concerning what they are about to read. Even now, I often issue trigger warnings more informally. For instance, this past spring I sent out a podcast on female genital mutilation to my students with the caveat that they should not listen to it while driving. I had made that mistake, I told them, and nearly had to pull over at one point because it was such a hard listen and brought tears to my eyes. The point of giving due warning, for me, is not to silence debate but rather to prepare people so that they can (hopefully) move beyond their understandable initial reactions of shock, horror, disgust, and trauma and enter into an intellectual discussion of the materials and questions at hand. From another alum, Nabeel Ebeid: More than anything, I'm embarrassed. UChicago taught me to question so many assumptions and helped me to revise so many of my priors with logic and data. For the school to send its undergrads a letter without a clear definition of safe space or trigger warning, without any reference to sexual assault, harassment, or the contexts in which these words emerged, and without substantiating any link between those terms and academic freedom, Ellison is being lazy at best and, at worst, gratuitously malicious. One need not denigrate safe spaces or trigger warnings to support academic freedom or defend the right to bring controversial speakers to campus. More puzzling is that the school is full of safe spaces: the Center for Identity and Inclusion (Amandla Center in my day) worship groups, any number of campus affinity groups, etc (to say nothing of health counselors' offices). The school appears to endorse them wholeheartedly, and it's hard to imagine a day when it wouldn't. These spaces have provided both vibrant fora for   discussion as well as support systems for the marginalized. In my time at UChicago, they contributed to campus conversation with a wide array of speakers and perspectives that were often underrepresented in the Core. I can't recall a single instance in which these communities stifled free speech. The aversion to trigger warnings seems even stranger. Trigger warnings by definition prepare the reader or listener for triggering content the notion that these warnings stifle speech is unsubstantiated and farfetched. I also wonder how taking a stance against trigger warnings doesn't stifle the free speech of professors who may see value in sensitivity when introducing potentially triggering material. Finally, I wonder what kind of message a note like this sends to community members who may already be wary from recent Title IX investigations. Ellison seems to be reacting viscerally to the feeling that the marginalized have it too easy. If he was concerned about disinviting speakers, he could have said as much. Instead, he chose to bash vaguely   terms without appearing to understand them, and he strung them together into a paragraph of non sequiturs . .. all in the name of freedom. From another alum, Maira Khwaja, who graduated this past June: Dean Ellison misrepresents what trigger warnings and safe spaces have been on our campus, which are often nuanced and personalized for each professor (UChicago is nothing if not nuanced and overly verbose) and syllabi and department and extracurricular. His simplification, misrepresentation, and conflation of trigger     speakers are poor examples of the rigorous discourse that he boasts. In our histories of violence class, we did not shy away from any of America's most brutal understudied history, but we were given a thoughtful paragraph on the syllabus about the nature of the images and text we'd read in the archive. It'd be naive and foolish to disregard that thoughtful paragraph from our professor as something other than analysis that contributed to class discussion and understanding. Safe spaces are not made so that students can retreat from ideas they don't want to hear in fact, often safe spaces are built in our campus so that they can dive even further, with careful support (like support staff on hand, or respectful mutually made ground rules created) into discussions that would often be too uncomfortable for the classroom. An anonymous alum: I'm very disappointed in this admin at my former school over his nonsense about trigger warnings destroying freedom. And I love that it's a scholar at my current one so splendidly calling him out: As CUNY historian Angus Johnston notes, There's no college in the country where profs are required to give trigger warnings. They're all voluntary pedagogical choices. Which means a professor's use of trigger warnings isn't a threat to academic freedom. It's a MANIFESTATION of academic freedom. ' Academic freedom means that professors get to design their syllabus, not administrators like Ellison. His letter is a prime example of how the outcry against political correctness often leads to policy changes that limit free speech. Over the past week, my alma mater has been all over my (and probably your) news feed. The general dramatic headline: There will not be safe spaces or trigger warnings at the University of Chicago, according to a letter sent by John Ellison, dean of students at the university, to incoming freshmen. The letter immediately became a dot on the timeline of the ongoing national debate on campus politics, political correctness, and academic freedom   the media narrative being that an administration takes a stand on free speech and academic freedom, and that's followed swiftly by support and pushback from students, experts, and pundits. I went to the University of Chicago for undergrad in the early 2000s. I studied economics and sociology, and I have very fond memories of the school's peculiar culture: the way students laughed off the bitter winters, the way pulling   at the library (shoutout to the  ) was cool, the super weird school traditions like Scavhunt   so strange that The NYer once devoted nearly 4, 000 words to it. It's a place where people knowingly enrolled even though they've been told it's a place where fun comes to die.  I think we took pride in the image that we were young people who wanted to participate in school that was intellectually rigorous (the life of the mind) where a class about Nabokov's Lolita or Foucault's History of Sexuality were so popular it was hard to find a seat, where education was its own end, and everyone was a bit odd in their own way. I think my peers and I worried that culture (beloved by us) was starting to fade when I graduated in 2007: The school had switched from the UnCommon App to the Common App. The school started to rise in rankings, which was favorable for alumni   but we worried that it was at the cost of the school's identity and the students it would attract. The University of Chicago is about hard classes, but it's also about community.   In NY, where I live now, alumni are often   friend groups   my    spouse regularly laments that he knows more alumni from the U of C than his own university   that meet up regularly to have discussions not dissimilar to classes. (It's also interesting to note that some 20 percent of U of C alumni end up in academia.) With Ellison's letter, we all pondered what it's going to mean, and we did that together online. This week, I'm going to highlight some of the interesting discussions I've seen on social media and responses from the University of Chicago community. My colleague Alia Wong will join me in discussing these comments from students and alumni who share deep connections to the school and each other. For them, Ellison's letter is personal, in contrast to the way the national debate on campus politics can sometimes feel removed. From one alum, Laura Oppenheimer: I take an inordinate amount of pride in how hard I worked as a student at the U of C. My courses were not dumbed down, no one held my hand, and I was expected to read, grapple with, and discuss everything   ranging from Plato and Marx, to Four Hours in My Lai and Night. The reading was difficult, and frequently, so was the subject matter. What I wish Ellison had said was, as students at the University of Chicago, you will be expected to read, study and discuss many types of work, including work that may be upsetting, or work you may disagree with. This is part of a rigorous, academic education.  Instead, he issued a blanket statement that the school doesn't give trigger warnings, which are something that serve to protect those who may have PTSD due to past trauma. To me, despite the way trigger warnings have been   by overly sensitive college students, this was a misstep. I applaud the ethos, but I wish the administration had refined the message and made it about free speech and academic discourse, focusing more on the message it was trying to deliver, and less on grabbing a moment in the spotlight. From another alum: As a 2006 graduate, I have to say I completely support Ellison's letter 100 percent.  It really surprised me a lot because I didn't expect the University to go that far in support of true free speech, since free speech is not very popular these days, especially on college campuses.  But I am very glad (and proud) that the University took such a position.  I hope that they stick to it.  (Though as an aside, I also wonder how many people are hearing about the University for the very first time because of this letter   and to what extent that is a good thing or a bad thing.) A particularly insightful Facebook post from alum Nasia Anam: I don't think it would be a stretch to call University of Chicago a school of intellectual hard knocks. This has always been the unarticulated social contract of matriculating at U of C   the place that attracts kids who proudly don   emblazoned with the motto Where Fun Comes to Die, and [where] the   winter break is unofficially known as Suicide Prevention Day.         But a wholesale dismissal of trigger warnings and safe spaces as flimsy excuses for coddled millennials to continue lives of comfort, puppies, and   (not Plato!   to) is simultaneously a refusal to acknowledge an extremely problematic stance on student mental health. Clinical depression is not a prerequisite in the life of the mind, and being   by class material does not facilitate freedom of inquiry and expression but, quite to the contrary, precludes and damages a fruitful learning process. To make students uncomfortable, to create friction and tension in the classroom, lecture hall, auditorium, etc.   these are invaluable pedagogical tools. Asking students to exacerbate existing pain, trauma, or mental disturbance or enter spaces where they feel endangered or ashamed does absolutely nothing for the honorable pursuit of  . . .. My problem with the letter is not that it raises the issues of trigger warnings and safe spaces as dubious, but the unnecessarily harsh tone it takes. There is an underlying   assumption that incoming freshmen (legal adults, I might add) will not be able, of their own accord, to determine what may or may not be traumatic for them. Traumatic. Not disturbing, not unsettling. Traumatic. Trauma is a   psychological condition, and the fact that the letter gives it absolutely no credence gives the impression to incoming undergraduates that their mental health is not an issue that needs or warrants any attention whatsoever.        We should put pressure upon the concept of trigger warnings and safe spaces, yes. We should be vigilant about the ways these accommodative practices are abused. But to completely dismiss these pedagogical caveats as   psychobabble hooha is not only retrograde, it is contra to the aims of an administration that ostensibly seeks a more diverse population of students. Free expression and inquiry can by its very nature only occur in spaces where all individuals understand themselves to be equally free. Hostile and punitive classroom environments do not facilitate this goal. We should be debating and complicating the ideas of trigger warnings and safe spaces, not dismissing them. If you're a former or current student at the University of Chicago with an opinion on Ellison's letter, or you disagree with some of the points that I've included here, please send a note to hello@theatlantic. com.

114,56889,78170,Gaffe Track: Trump's Lie on Discussing the Wall,Atlantic,David A. Graham,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Every presidential campaign is full of unpredictable twists and turns. After a brief moment where it looked like the nation might slouch into a   rematch, the 2016 election is taking its place in that line of strange journeys. The one sure thing: There will be gaffes. Some will be humorous verbal   of the Bushian variety (“we ought to make the pie higher”) while others will seem more revealing of a candidate's weaknesses (Herman Cain's tetchy dismissal of questions about “    ”). Some will seem important but ultimately have little effect (like “Bittergate”). Some will seem damaging but actually do little (Rick Perry's “oops”) while others will seem minor at first but prove more damaging (Perry's statement that those who oppose education for illegal immigrants “don't have a heart. ”) Some, like the latter Perry remark, will be Kinsley gaffes, where a politician accidentally tells the truth about facts or his own views. The very occasional gaffe will end up defining an entire cycle, as Mitt Romney's secretly videotaped comment about “the 47 percent” did. Knowing that the range of gaffes is wide, and that the import of a gaffe is often inflated (or overlooked) early on, Gaffe Track is The Atlantic's bid to cover these gaffes with a consistent approach, creating a nearly   chronological inventory of the missteps, miscalculations, and misstatements of the 2016 presidential campaign. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: On Wednesday, the Republican nominee traveled to Mexico City to meet with Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto. At a press conference, the men were asked if they d discussed Trump s promise to make Mexico pay for a border wall.  Who pays for the wall? We didn t discuss it, ? Trump said. (Listen for yourself here.) Later, PeÃ±a Nieto issued a statement claiming he had ruled it out. Then Trump s campaign issued a statement that didn t dispute that. Then on Thursday, on Laura Ingraham s radio show, Trump claimed he had said that they did discuss it: Trump to @ingrahamangle: ”I said, no, we did discuss the wall.” He was asked about who would pay for it. pic. twitter.  (Listen here: Trump: 'Hillary Moves Slow On Everything  We Will Have Softening On Immigration') It s a fantastic claim, in the sense of being both amazing and also being a fantasy anyone can listen to Trump s press conference and hear clearly what he said. The defense: Â¯'_( ãƒ„) ¯ Why it matters (or doesn t):  The lesson: The walls have ears, whether they are discussed or not ”and so do the rest of us. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: Jake Anantha is an    Charlotte, North Carolina, man who is   and was, until Thursday night, a fervent Trump supporter looking forward to casting his first vote for president for the Republican. But when he went to Trump s rally in Charlotte, he was ejected ”he believes because of the color of his skin.  I told him I've never been to another rally in my life. I m a huge Trump supporter. I would never protest against Trump, ? he told CNN.  I do think it s because I m brown. ? The defense: Security told Anantha that he looked just like a man who d caused trouble at previous ralli. .. ”wait, no, that doesn t actually make it any better. Why it matters (or doesn t): On a basic level, it s not a good idea to alienate your supporters, especially when you re already down by several points in the polls. (Anantha now says he ll perhaps vote for Gary Johnson.) The incident offers ammunition to anyone who thinks the Trump campaign is driven by racial resentment and dislike of minorities. On the plus side, Trump doesn t really have enough minority supporters for this to make a dent. The lesson: If you support candidates who back racial profiling, you might get racially profiled at their rallies. The candidate: Clinton, The gaffe: Who s that standing behind the Democratic nominee during a rally in Kissimmee, Florida? Oh, just Seddique Mateen, the father of Orlando nightclub gunman Omar Mateen and a man who has espoused   and   views, in addition to peculiar statements suggesting he holds some power in Afghanistan. The defense: In a statement to WPTV, the Clinton campaign said,  The rally was a     event for the public. This individual wasn't invited as a guest and the campaign was unaware of his attendance until after the event. ? (Mateen also said he had just decided to go.) Why it matters (or doesn t): This isn t a major gaffe by the candidate, but it s sort of baffling. Sure, events are open to the public, but how did staffers allow their boss to get in a situation where she was standing in front of Mateen, sitting somewhat prominently in the grandstand? He s not the name you want in headlines with Clinton. Perhaps Trump was right:  We have no idea where they come from, we have no idea who the hell they are. We know they believe in certain things that we don t want to believe in. ? The lesson: Screen anyone who might appear on screen. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: On Wednesday, the Republican nominee talked about watching a video of American officials unloading cash in Iran. The cash was real ”a Wall Street Journal scoop revealed it ”but there was no video. Trump s spokeswoman admitted that to The Washington Post, saying he was referring to a different video. And yet on Thursday, Trump once again claimed to have watched the video.  I woke up yesterday and I saw $400 million ”different currencies, they probably don t want our currency ”being flown to Iran, ? he said in Maine on Thursday.  You know it was interesting, because a tape was made, with the airplane coming in, nice airplane, and the money coming off I guess. That was given to us, has to be, by the Iranians. You know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. ? The defense: The first time Trump made the claim, it was plausible he was just confused. But now? Why it matters (or doesn t): There are two possibilities, neither especially flattering. One is that the campaign knows Trump is mistaken, but no one bothered to tell the candidate, leaving him to make a public gaffe. Another is that Trump knows quite well and doesn t care. It takes a special sort of brazenness, and a certain kind of faith in one s base, and probably a certain sort of delusion about how politics works, to assume that you can get away with lying about this. It s not the first time Trump has claimed to have seen a video that didn t exist ”like when he described tape of Muslims supposedly celebrating   in New Jersey. So maybe Trump really does believe he saw the tape. Which isn t a good sign either. The moral: The camera doesn t lie, but the candidate might. The candidate: Clinton, The gaffe: Speaking in Omaha on Tuesday, the Democrat said,  Trump wants to cut taxes for the super rich, ? she said, to boos.  Well, we re not going there, my friends. I m telling you right now, we re going to write fairer rules for the middle class and we ? ”here s where things get interesting. Some people heard what she said as  are going to raise taxes for the middle class. ? But on a closer listen, she s clearly saying  aren t. ? The defense: Even if Clinton had said  are, ? it would be a clear slip of the tongue, not a declaration of policy. Clinton has promised not to raised taxes on anyone making up to $250, 000 ”significantly higher than most reasonable definitions of the middle class, although   groups argue she d do so anyway through backdoor methods. Why it matters (or doesn t): Some conservatives will take this as a Kinsley gaffe, the classic variety in which a candidate accidentally tells the truth, but substantively, there s not much here. Not since Fritz Mondale has a Democratic candidate been willing to say he or she will raise taxes on the middle class, and Mondale got shellacked. Clinton s not about to emulate him. The lesson: Mumbles risk grumbles and campaign fumbles. The candidate: Clinton, The gaffe: Speaking to Fox News  Chris Wallace on July 30, Clinton said of her email scandal,  [FBI] Director [James] Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I ve said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails. ? Except as The Washington Post explains, that s not what he said at all. While Comey said Clinton had not lied to the FBI and recommended against charging her, he was also clear that she had emailed classified material. The defense: Clinton is right that Comey deemed her not to have lied to the FBI, at least. Why it matters (or doesn t): As my colleague Ron Fournier writes, Clinton s insistence on continuing to lie about what Comey said is puzzling. Even as she has apologized for using the server and escaped indictment, she apparently can t bring herself to simply eat crow and move on, and instead misstates easily available facts. For a candidate already facing serious trust issues with much of the electorate, that seems unwise. Luckily for her, Trump has decided to launch a feud with Gold Star parents, propose appeasing Putin, and say the election is rigged, distracting a great deal of attention. The lesson: Keep it straight and the election could be signed, sealed, and delivered to Clinton. Otherwise, the   is in the email. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: USA Today s Kirsten Powers asked Trump about the allegations of sexual harassment that toppled Fox News honcho Roger Ailes. When Trump downplayed them, she asked how he d feel if his daughter was harassed.  I would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case, ? he said. Tuesday morning, Trump s son Eric tried to clean it up. While saying harassment should be reported and dealt with, he added,  I don t think she would allow herself to be subjected to that. ? The defense: The Republican has said he  would be the best for women ? and that  Nobody has more respect for women than Trump! ? Why it matters (or doesn t): As Powers notes, Trump s answer falls short for several reasons. It overlooks the fact that not all women can easily just leave a job. Moreover, it pushes the illegality of harassment off to the side, while placing the burden to rectify the situation on victims of sexual harassment. Eric Trump s answer, meanwhile, implies that victims of harassment are somehow not  strong. ? These sorts of statements matter because they re liable to alienate women, a group with which Trump already trails badly ”  in a recent CNN poll his unfavorable rating with women is even worse. The lesson: Don t blame the victim, especially if the victim is a voter. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: Speaking to ABC s George Stephanopoulos, Trump said of Russian President Vladimir Putin,  He's not going into Ukraine, OK? Just so you understand. He's not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down and you can put it down, you can take it anywhere you want. ? Stephanopoulos pointed out that Russia had already annexed Crimea. The response was classic Trump: This is all proof of how terrible Obama is, but also it s not really so bad. He confirmed that he would consider recognizing the annexation:  But, you know, the people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. ? The defense: It s Obama s fault, or something. Why it matters (or doesn t): At first glance, this looks like a classic example of Trump just not really knowing what he s talking about, a trait that endears him to supporters (he s a  !) and terrifies opponents (he s dangerously ignorant! ). But on closer glance, this is evidence of Trump s radically different approach to foreign policy. In his worldview, Russia seizing sovereign territory in violation of international law is acceptable. He even parrots the Kremlin line that Crimeans have a right to   ”further evidence of a close alignment between Putin and Trump. The lesson: A politician shouldn t Kiev his opponents ammunition with unforced errors ”but then again, the only Sebastopol that matters is on election day. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: On Thursday, Khizr Khan, the father of slain U. S. Army solider Humayun Khan, delivered the most memorable moment of either party convention. Speaking at the DNC, Khan said,  Clinton was right when she called my son  the best of America.  If it was up to Trump, he never would have been in America. ? Khan continued asked whether Trump had ever read the Constitution and said,  You have sacrificed nothing and no one. ? Asked about that by ABC s George Stephanopoulos, Trump first questioned why Khizr Khan s wife Ghazala did not speak.  If you look at his wife, she was standing there, ? he said.  She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say. Then Trump said he d sacrificed:  I think I've made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. I've created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I've done, I've had tremendous success. ? A somewhat incredulous Stephanopoulos asked if those were really sacrifices.  Oh, sure. I think they're sacrifices, ? Trump said. The defense: The Trump campaign sent out the full transcript of his remarks Sunday, suggesting they were exculpatory. Not so much. Why it matters (or doesn t): At this early stage, this looks like one of the rare gaffes that might stick. Khizr Khan s speech was devastating, with a grieving immigrant father whose son died for the USA calling Trump out for proposing a ban on Muslims entering the country. Trump s response was to make a snarky remark (for the record, Ghazala Khan, who has spoken in interviews, said she was too emotional to speak) and then to claim, incredibly, that having a successful business career was somewhat an equivalent sacrifice to having a son die in combat. (Trump, a   once likened his quest to avoid STDs to the Vietnam War.) The comment speaks for itself, but not in a good way. Just wait: Trump might still make it worse. Sunday morning, he defended his right to counterpunch at Khan Sunday morning: I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me! The lesson: Sacrificing oneself on the altar of propriety and respectability does not qualify as  . The candidate: Donald J.  ¦ Crump? Can t really recall. The gaffe: During a July 27 news conference ”yep, the same one where he called on Russia to release hacked U. S. government information ”the Republican repeatedly referred to Tim Kaine, the U. S. senator from Virginia who is Clinton s running mate, as a New Jerseyan. The defense: Trump seems to have been confusing Kaine with Tom Kean, a Republican who was Garden State governor, and whose name is pronounced  cane. ? No word on the whereabouts of Herman Cain. Why it matters (or doesn t): This is one of the more ephemeral gaffes, and pales in importance compared to his bizarre plea to Russia. (The whole press conference was weird.) Mostly, it suggests Trump either can t or doesn t care to master the details of politics. The lesson: If you re going for a Kaine break, be careful you don t graze Kean instead. The candidate: Trump. Yep, again. The gaffe: On July 2, Trump tweeted out an image featuring Clinton s face over a background of cash, with a   star reading  Most corrupt candidate ever. ? Many people immediately recognized this as an   dogwhistle, as the   Star of David is a symbol of Judaism. Trump deleted the tweet, then resent the same image with the star changed to a circle. The defense: Trump argues that it was a sheriff s badge, or perhaps a  basic ?   star. But a sheriff s badge wouldn t make any sense in this context. There s also the small problem that the image appears to have originated in a    message board, then traveled to an   Twitter account before being picked up by Trump. Why it matters (or doesn t): Trump s tweet has produced a heated debate over whether Trump is  . That argument is to a certain extent beside the point. It s hard ”though some diehards are finding ways ”to ignore the pattern of Trump encouraging   and other racist elements, regardless of whether Trump himself bears any personal animus toward Jews. (One of his staunch defenders at this moment is his    Jared Kushner, who is Jewish.) Time and again, Trump has tweeted or retweeted material that originated with white supremacists. There was also, of course, the moment where he declined to condemn an endorsement from former KKK leader David Duke, and later tried to blame it on a bad earpiece. (Duke helpfully insists the star was a Star of David, by the way.) The white supremacists are certainly convinced that Trump is speaking to them with a wink and a nudge. In any case, Trump shows no remorse. The lesson: This schmuck s shtick is still a shanda. The candidate: Donald J. Trump, The gaffe: Speaking in Raleigh, North Carolina, last night, Trump found the positive side of the late repressive, genocidal Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. ”He was a bad guy ”really bad guy. But you know what? He did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn't read them the rights. They didn't talk. They were terrorists. Over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism. ? The defense: There s a coherent case that toppling Saddam was a grave error because it destabilized the Middle East and led to sectarian wars, broader regional dysfunction, and ISIS. Also, the Harvard remark is kind of hilarious trolling coming from a Penn grad. Why it matters (or doesn t): Here s a handy,   guide for presidential candidates on when to praise Saddam Hussein:  Never. ? Whatever the case to be made that toppling Saddam was a bad idea, it s not really the case Trump made. Instead, he praised a war criminal for his handling of enemies, and a known sponsor of terrorism for his killing of terrorists. (When Henry Kissinger makes the case for cozying up to repressive dictators because of American   he s revered as a wise statesman, but when Trump does it, everyone is appalled ”though maybe that says more about Kissinger than about Trump.) This isn t the first time Trump has argued the world would be better off with Saddam in power, and it s not even the first time he s made the  Harvard of Terrorism ? joke. But once again, the Republican has managed to trip on his own feet, distracting from condemnation of Clinton s email. It s a weird comment to make in North Carolina, a state with many Iraq veterans, though he also suggested in Greensboro that U. S. soldiers siphoned reconstruction funds. Anyway, all of this would ring a lot more true if Trump had been opposed to the Iraq war from the start. But despite his claims, he clearly supported it. The lesson: Praising Saddam can make a candidate s image go from Baath to worse.         ",False,"Every presidential campaign is full of unpredictable twists and turns. After a brief moment where it looked like the nation might slouch into a   rematch, the 2016 election is taking its place in that line of strange journeys. The one sure thing: There will be gaffes.

Clinton has promised not to raised taxes on anyone making up to $250, 000 significantly higher than most reasonable definitions of the middle class, although   groups argue she d do so anyway through backdoor methods. Why it matters (or doesn t): Some conservatives will take this as a Kinsley gaffe, the classic variety in which a candidate accidentally tells the truth, but substantively, there s not much here. Not since Fritz Mondale has a Democratic candidate been willing to say he or she will raise taxes on the middle class, and Mondale got shellacked. Clinton s not about to emulate him. The lesson: Mumbles risk grumbles and campaign fumbles. The candidate: Clinton, The gaffe: Speaking to Fox News  Chris Wallace on July 30, Clinton said of her email scandal,  [FBI] Director [James] Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I ve said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails. ? Except as The Washington Post explains, that s not what he said at all. While Comey said Clinton had not lied to the FBI and recommended against charging her, he was also clear that she had emailed classified material. The defense: Clinton is right that Comey deemed her not to have lied to the FBI, at least. Why it matters (or doesn t): As my colleague Ron Fournier writes, Clinton s insistence on continuing to lie about what Comey said is puzzling. Even as she has apologized for using the server and escaped indictment, she apparently can t bring herself to simply eat crow and move on, and instead misstates easily available facts. For a candidate already facing serious trust issues with much of the electorate, that seems unwise. Luckily for her, Trump has decided to launch a feud with Gold Star parents, propose appeasing Putin, and say the election is rigged, distracting a great deal of attention. The lesson: Keep it straight and the election could be signed, sealed, and delivered to Clinton. Otherwise, the   is in the email. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: USA Today s Kirsten Powers asked Trump about the allegations of sexual harassment that toppled Fox News honcho Roger Ailes. When Trump downplayed them, she asked how he d feel if his daughter was harassed.  I would like to think she would find another career or find another company if that was the case, ? he said. Tuesday morning, Trump s son Eric tried to clean it up. While saying harassment should be reported and dealt with, he added,  I don t think she would allow herself to be subjected to that. ? The defense: The Republican has said he  would be the best for women ? and that  Nobody has more respect for women than Trump! ? Why it matters (or doesn t): As Powers notes, Trump s answer falls short for several reasons. It overlooks the fact that not all women can easily just leave a job. Moreover, it pushes the illegality of harassment off to the side, while placing the burden to rectify the situation on victims of sexual harassment. Eric Trump s answer, meanwhile, implies that victims of harassment are somehow not  strong. ? These sorts of statements matter because they re liable to alienate women, a group with which Trump already trails badly   in a recent CNN poll his unfavorable rating with women is even worse. The lesson: Don t blame the victim, especially if the victim is a voter. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: Speaking to ABC s George Stephanopoulos, Trump said of Russian President Vladimir Putin,  He's not going into Ukraine, OK? Just so you understand. He's not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down and you can put it down, you can take it anywhere you want. ? Stephanopoulos pointed out that Russia had already annexed Crimea. The response was classic Trump: This is all proof of how terrible Obama is, but also it s not really so bad. He confirmed that he would consider recognizing the annexation:  But, you know, the people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. ? The defense: It s Obama s fault, or something. Why it matters (or doesn t): At first glance, this looks like a classic example of Trump just not really knowing what he s talking about, a trait that endears him to supporters (he s a  !) and terrifies opponents (he s dangerously ignorant! ). But on closer glance, this is evidence of Trump s radically different approach to foreign policy. In his worldview, Russia seizing sovereign territory in violation of international law is acceptable. He even parrots the Kremlin line that Crimeans have a right to   further evidence of a close alignment between Putin and Trump. The lesson: A politician shouldn t Kiev his opponents ammunition with unforced errors but then again, the only Sebastopol that matters is on election day. The candidate: Trump, The gaffe: On Thursday, Khizr Khan, the father of slain U. S. Army solider Humayun Khan, delivered the most memorable moment of either party convention. Speaking at the DNC, Khan said,  Clinton was right when she called my son  the best of America.  If it was up to Trump, he never would have been in America. ? Khan continued asked whether Trump had ever read the Constitution and said,  You have sacrificed nothing and no one. ? Asked about that by ABC s George Stephanopoulos, Trump first questioned why Khizr Khan s wife Ghazala did not speak.  If you look at his wife, she was standing there, ? he said.  She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say. Then Trump said he d sacrificed:  I think I've made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. I've created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I've done, I've had tremendous success. ? A somewhat incredulous Stephanopoulos asked if those were really sacrifices.  Oh, sure. I think they're sacrifices, ? Trump said. The defense: The Trump campaign sent out the full transcript of his remarks Sunday, suggesting they were exculpatory. Not so much. Why it matters (or doesn t): At this early stage, this looks like one of the rare gaffes that might stick. Khizr Khan s speech was devastating, with a grieving immigrant father whose son died for the USA calling Trump out for proposing a ban on Muslims entering the country. Trump s response was to make a snarky remark (for the record, Ghazala Khan, who has spoken in interviews, said she was too emotional to speak) and then to claim, incredibly, that having a successful business career was somewhat an equivalent sacrifice to having a son die in combat. (Trump, a   once likened his quest to avoid STDs to the Vietnam War.) The comment speaks for itself, but not in a good way. Just wait: Trump might still make it worse. Sunday morning, he defended his right to counterpunch at Khan Sunday morning: I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me! The lesson: Sacrificing oneself on the altar of propriety and respectability does not qualify as  . The candidate: Donald J.   Crump? Can t really recall. The gaffe: During a July 27 news conference yep, the same one where he called on Russia to release hacked U. S. government information the Republican repeatedly referred to Tim Kaine, the U. S. senator from Virginia who is Clinton s running mate, as a New Jerseyan. The defense: Trump seems to have been confusing Kaine with Tom Kean, a Republican who was Garden State governor, and whose name is pronounced  cane. ? No word on the whereabouts of Herman Cain. Why it matters (or doesn t): This is one of the more ephemeral gaffes, and pales in importance compared to his bizarre plea to Russia. (The whole press conference was weird.) Mostly, it suggests Trump either can t or doesn t care to master the details of politics. The lesson: If you re going for a Kaine break, be careful you don t graze Kean instead. The candidate: Trump. Yep, again. The gaffe: On July 2, Trump tweeted out an image featuring Clinton s face over a background of cash, with a   star reading  Most corrupt candidate ever. ? Many people immediately recognized this as an   dogwhistle, as the   Star of David is a symbol of Judaism. Trump deleted the tweet, then resent the same image with the star changed to a circle. The defense: Trump argues that it was a sheriff s badge, or perhaps a  basic ?   star. But a sheriff s badge wouldn t make any sense in this context. There s also the small problem that the image appears to have originated in a    message board, then traveled to an   Twitter account before being picked up by Trump. Why it matters (or doesn t): Trump s tweet has produced a heated debate over whether Trump is  . That argument is to a certain extent beside the point. It s hard though some diehards are finding ways to ignore the pattern of Trump encouraging   and other racist elements, regardless of whether Trump himself bears any personal animus toward Jews. (One of his staunch defenders at this moment is his    Jared Kushner, who is Jewish.) Time and again, Trump has tweeted or retweeted material that originated with white supremacists. There was also, of course, the moment where he declined to condemn an endorsement from former KKK leader David Duke, and later tried to blame it on a bad earpiece. (Duke helpfully insists the star was a Star of David, by the way.) The white supremacists are certainly convinced that Trump is speaking to them with a wink and a nudge. In any case, Trump shows no remorse. The lesson: This schmuck s shtick is still a shanda. The candidate: Donald J. Trump, The gaffe: Speaking in Raleigh, North Carolina, last night, Trump found the positive side of the late repressive, genocidal Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. He was a bad guy really bad guy. But you know what? He did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn't read them the rights. They didn't talk. They were terrorists. Over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism. ? The defense: There s a coherent case that toppling Saddam was a grave error because it destabilized the Middle East and led to sectarian wars, broader regional dysfunction, and ISIS. Also, the Harvard remark is kind of hilarious trolling coming from a Penn grad. Why it matters (or doesn t): Here s a handy,   guide for presidential candidates on when to praise Saddam Hussein:  Never. ? Whatever the case to be made that toppling Saddam was a bad idea, it s not really the case Trump made. Instead, he praised a war criminal for his handling of enemies, and a known sponsor of terrorism for his killing of terrorists. (When Henry Kissinger makes the case for cozying up to repressive dictators because of American   he s revered as a wise statesman, but when Trump does it, everyone is appalled though maybe that says more about Kissinger than about Trump.) This isn t the first time Trump has argued the world would be better off with Saddam in power, and it s not even the first time he s made the  Harvard of Terrorism ? joke. But once again, the Republican has managed to trip on his own feet, distracting from condemnation of Clinton s email. It s a weird comment to make in North Carolina, a state with many Iraq veterans, though he also suggested in Greensboro that U. S. soldiers siphoned reconstruction funds. Anyway, all of this would ring a lot more true if Trump had been opposed to the Iraq war from the start. But despite his claims, he clearly supported it. The lesson: Praising Saddam can make a candidate s image go from Baath to worse.         "
115,56890,78171,What ‘Safe Space' Looks Like In the Classroom,Atlantic,Alia Wong,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Readers, staffers, and others from the University of Chicago community discuss Dean John Ellison's injunction against trigger warnings and safe spaces. If you have something to add, particularly as a professor, alumnus, or current student at the University of Chicago, please email hello@theatlantic. com. (A previous reader discussion on trigger warnings and campus politics is here.) As we sifted through responses to the famed University of Chicago letter, we figured it'd be worth spotlighting what instructors feel about the whole thing. After all, they arguably understand the impact safe spaces and trigger warnings have on the classroom better than anyone else. Educators recognize the value of challenging students intellectually they know students should, at times, feel uncomfortable with the learning material. But they also know that absolutes are dangerous —  that sometimes safe spaces and trigger warnings are conducive, and not antithetical, to the robust, stimulating intellectual environment they seek. And at the end of the day, they don't like being told how to run their classroom. Here's what some current or former university instructors had to say: Andrew Dombrowski, a former university instructor who's now a counselor at the Berkeley Free Clinic, which he describes as a “    oriented”   collective: Safe spaces are really emphasized in our training process and I'm not going to lie, the letter took me aback at first. For us, just as a point of clarification, safe spaces involve establishing certain rules and expectations in a   manner, rather than excluding people from given backgrounds. Anyway, what I've come to realize is that when properly deployed, safe spaces can actually be actually very congruent to the values of open and rigorous intellectual inquiry —  it's less about shielding people from challenging ideas, and more about encouraging people to open up and explore challenging ideas in a *more* fearless way because they don't have to worry about irrelevant stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the ideas or content under discussion. I still don't feel like I speak the language of safe spaces natively —  I tend to couch these values to myself in terms like   inquiry and “being a decent human being” —  but I don't think there has to be ANY conflict with the academic values that I remain committed to even now that I don't work in academia. I don't doubt that there are people who abuse the concept of safe spaces in order to shut people down, but those people can be criticized without lapsing into the “grumble grumble grumble damn kids these days just want to be coddled stupid kids don't want to be exposed to new ideas” discourse that is WAY too prevalent in this conversation. I'm very disappointed in the letter, because one of the principles of basic intellectual good practice that I learned at UChicago is to engage with the strongest reasonable form of an argument you're opposed to, not to snarkily set up a   argument in hopes that it will go viral (and let's not kid ourselves, this was done with an eye to the outside world and external publicity). That's what really bothers me here I'm less invested in the ultimate policy decision and more profoundly disappointed by the lack of intellectual rigor and honesty involved in failing to reckon with the other side. An anonymous alum: Now that I'm on the other side of the classroom, I try to create as welcoming of an intellectual space as I can. In economics we talk about some difficult issues: the gender pay gap, consequences of inequality, effects of migration, consequence of job loss, social policies such as welfare and rent control. These have the potential to be sensitive issues for the reason that the things we discuss in my classroom may have consequentially affected my students' lives outside the classroom. I always try, though I do not always succeed, to ensure that everyone feels like their voice is respected. But I don't permit any idea to be a sacred cow. That is, students will have to tolerate that others might disagree with their opinion. I require that they find a way to disagree with someone while maintaining respect for them, hopefully by employing data and facts, and not resorting to Trumpisms such as ad hominem attacks. I care much more about the process through which students come to hold their beliefs —  and that throughout they maintain respect for others —  than in any particular beliefs they hold. I have two experiences from teaching at an elite liberal arts school where I was accused by students of crossing the safe space line. In the first instance, I was teaching at a women's college. Two male students from a nearby university attended, so the class was approximately 90 percent female. Both of the male students were engineering students, whereas none of the female students were. In class I referenced the entrepreneur Elon Musk and got mostly blank stares but some nods from the male students. As an aside to the two male engineering students, I mentioned one of his projects. A female student later came to my office hours that week to discuss the incident. She voiced that singling out the male students in the class made the rest of the class feel uncomfortable. I thanked her for her feedback and asked her to return again if she found anything upsetting in the future. While personally I thought the student may have been overly sensitive, I appreciated the feedback. I strive to create a welcoming environment, and if there's ways I can do that better I want to know. In contrast, the other incident was handled quite differently. I was lecturing on wage setting and made the slightly indelicate comment “the firm buys this worker” to mean that a firm hired a worker at a given wage. A student interrupted my lecture, saying, “You can't say that. They aren't slaves. ” I was taken aback. Was this student suggesting that I condoned slavery? No sooner had the comment left my mouth than I realized there was a better way of phrasing it, but I didn't think it required interruption. I stumbled through the next 10 minutes of my lecture before returning to myself. Had this student come to my office and mentioned the comment I would have apologized and professed to be more careful. I left class embarrassed and, if I were honest, resentful towards the student for the interruption, whose comment I never would have been audacious enough to raise as an undergraduate. What's missing from this debate is a guideline for dialogue between students and faculty about how we can create a more welcoming classroom environment. If we want to discuss meaningful topics, students risk feeling discomfort. However, U of C's “no safe space allowed” mantra only gets us half the way there. The other crucial element is knowing how to resolve incidents when students feel distressed. Another anonymous alum: 1. I am largely supportive of this letter in its context as a cover letter for a longer book, which is how it was sent out. A letter to incoming freshmen does not actually set university policy that's reserved for the handbook that no one reads. 2. Trigger warnings, safe spaces, and speaker censorship are all actually different issues. 3. I am largely against university “trigger warnings. ” The example that is usually used is of sexual assault survivors being triggered, which most decent people immediately agree with. I would propose the more ridiculous example of someone with extreme arachnophobia. Should an instructor teaching The Lord of the Rings have to say “Warning: Spiders?” If not, why not? Are some traumas more    than others? 4. I am very pro insightful contextualization before a piece of media. In film class, rather than “Warning: This film has rape,” a sensible and sensitive instructor might say “I want you to pay attention to how the stillness and position of the camera makes the audience complicit. ” 5. Students have the option of opting out of anything they want to. They just get penalized for it. 6. Students who have gone through the official steps of seeking accommodations (for dyslexia, ADD, PTSD, etc.) should be respected and accommodated. They are not a burden. Timothy   an associate professor of history at Rutgers: While I don't use trigger warnings in the classroom, I'd be appalled if an administrator at my own institution attempted to dictate to me or my students what they should expect from their instructors with regard to such warnings. It would abrogate my academic freedom as an instructor. In this context, Ellison's words cruelly ignore the recent and devastating history of indifference by University of Chicago administrators to marginalized students' safety. I think the University of Chicago has a fetish of the universal and a hostility toward concepts or ideas that can be construed as “particular. ” (For example, as a graduate student there, I taught a course that at most other institutions would be called “Introduction to LGBT Studies” at Chicago, it is, or at least was, called “Problems in the Study of Sexuality. ”) There is a concomitant sense that the heroic individual scholar can and should engage in the life of the mind, without being embedded in the messy realities of the real world. In its most troubling versions, this leads to a sense on the part of administrators that discrimination and structural oppression can be wished or willed away, or that catering to demands for inclusion would somehow be “coddling. ” This letter about trigger warnings  safe spaces? In my view, it's not at all motivated by actual concern about TWs and safe spaces. Continuing our series of comments from the University of Chicago community regarding Dean John Ellison's letter, some alumni and students have expressed that the move smelled, at least partially, like a publicity stunt. From one current University of Chicago student, who hints that the administration has been trying to change the image of those beloved strange “dark” days of the school I remember so well: To me, the whole situation reads as a poorly conceived publicity stunt. The University is in this strange moment where its undergrad exclusivity has recently shot up, and it seems to want to do everything it can to bolster its reputation. The College also attempting to rebrand through ditching the    masochism tone of prior decades and attempting to court a reputation of Fun, Exciting Academic Rigor. However, this all leaves the College without a coherent identity, and the admins pinned their hopes on riding the   wave of think pieces on the matter, which would allow them to capitalize on dissatisfaction with the Millennial bogeyman's perceived censorship problem, hostility toward the ivory tower, and the massive moderate frustrated by youth movements in general. It certainly doesn't represent any actual policy change: the University has explicitly said that this is not a blanket ban on trigger warnings, but that it still allows professors to choose what to do at their discretion. I have no idea whether it worked. It will have appealed to those forces I mentioned, but of course will also drive away prospective students involved in the   community. From another alum: Have you ever actually had a lesson plan or discussion section disrupted because students claimed they felt “triggered” by the material? Sometimes I find the language and the logic of the “trigger warning” a bit stultifying, but really that's only in the abstract because no one has ever actually invoked it. I can count the number of times a student has asked to take a step back from a set of readings or a specific conversation on one hand, and then it's with ample, generous explanation and always when we were dealing with genuinely disturbing material. I suppose this letter disappoints me because it reads like fairly blatant administrative grandstanding. More insidiously, I am afraid that it will produce the very effects that it claims it is trying to prevent —  the foreclosure of a dialogue between all interested parties. And lastly, an alum questions whether the letter is speaking to the university's community and how consistent the university's administration has been on the issue: I find the letter from U of C to be somewhat embarrassing. On the surface, who can argue with academic freedom? But I take the appeal to it here to be fairly empty posturing and, more importantly, it's part of a pattern of the administration appealing to academic freedom at the same time as —  or in order to —  act badly. When I was an undergrad they were refusing to divest from Darfur because taking a political stance would somehow violate academic freedom. It seemed to me at the time to be a fairly transparent attempt to preserve the status quo and avoid a financial hassle —  and I'm skeptical that divestment was in any way contrary to the famous Kalven Report. And we can add to this the University's treatment of protesters, including those who were agitating for a trauma unit at the hospitals and the more recent threats against the student body president who organized a  . Throw in the   letter that the president just sent, too. Appealing to academic freedom while acting this way may not be acting inconsistently, exactly, but it isn't great. What I take away from all of this is that the administrators don't care about academic freedom. They care about their  . And their interest is in propping up the speech of some and not others. In making their decisions, I have a hard time imagining these administrators sitting around thinking carefully about the meaning of academic freedom in all of its complexity and nuance. That kind of pondering was what my professors taught me at U of C. What I read is a letter with all the nuance and care of a talk radio host. I'm confident that Chicago will continue being a great school with incredible faculty and students doing amazing things. This letter contributes nothing to the quality of the institution —  nor does it detract from it. It's a shadow on the wall of the cave. I wish it had been something worth our time, because these issues do matter. I don't think that trigger warnings and safe spaces are inconsistent with academic freedom —  not in the least. But I don't think that this is about that —  it's just an attempt at branding, as well as ignoring or silencing or marginalizing protest at the University. It sets up those that want the University to act as a better citizen (with respect to its students and the broader community) as  . And while those that protest very well might be wrong —  that's debatable, for sure —  I think the   slant is an insubstantial smear. If we're going to have a   conversation about trigger warnings and safe spaces, then fine. The Dean should write the kind of reasoned, deep treatment of the issues that the U of C community deserves. Yesterday, my colleague, Bourree Lam, looked at how University of Chicago alumni are responding to the   letter their alma mater sent out last week to incoming freshmen. The letter essentially warned students that the university —  which for decades has espoused its commitment to “freedom of expression” —  would not tolerate “intellectual ‘safe spaces'” and “  ‘trigger warnings. '” The thinking behind the letter, presumably, is that safe spaces and trigger warnings inherently suppress free speech and academic freedom —  and, in turn, that the university felt a need to defend those values. As Bourree highlighted yesterday, that premise outraged many alumni, who remember their years at the university as experiences rife with challenging and uncomfortable discussions. Others argued that the wholesale rejection of things like trigger warnings misses the point. It got us thinking: What is a trigger warning, anyway? What defines a safe space? Lots of people have questioned whether Dean of Students John Ellison, who wrote the letter, actually understands what the terms mean. My colleague, Conor Friedersdorf, chimed in on the topic this morning. Here's what some from the academic community had to say. From an alum, Audrey Truschke: I would say that the letter brought up mixed reactions from me. I wholeheartedly support the basic idea that universities ought to have a strong, unflinching commitment to academic freedom of speech, and I think numerous institutions have dangerously compromised that ideal recently. That said, I use trigger warnings periodically on syllabi. I started including them formally, as part of the written syllabus, last year when I realized that I had been doing them informally for years. For me, it always seemed to be common sense that when you find yourself, say, assigning a graphic description of rape, you might give your students a   during the prior class meeting, concerning what they are about to read. Even now, I often issue ”trigger warnings” more informally. For instance, this past spring I sent out a podcast on female genital mutilation to my students with the caveat that they should not listen to it while driving. I had made that mistake, I told them, and nearly had to pull over at one point because it was such a hard listen and brought tears to my eyes. The point of giving due warning, for me, is not to silence debate but rather to prepare people so that they can (hopefully) move beyond their understandable initial reactions of shock, horror, disgust, and trauma and enter into an intellectual discussion of the materials and questions at hand. From another alum, Nabeel Ebeid: More than anything, I'm embarrassed. UChicago taught me to question so many assumptions and helped me to revise so many of my priors with logic and data. For the school to send its undergrads a letter without a clear definition of “safe space” or “trigger warning,” without any reference to sexual assault, harassment, or the contexts in which these words emerged, and without substantiating any link between those terms and academic freedom, Ellison is being lazy at best and, at worst, gratuitously malicious. One need not denigrate safe spaces or trigger warnings to support academic freedom or defend the right to bring controversial speakers to campus. More puzzling is that the school is full of safe spaces: the Center for Identity and Inclusion (Amandla Center in my day) worship groups, any number of campus affinity groups, etc (to say nothing of health counselors' offices). The school appears to endorse them wholeheartedly, and it's hard to imagine a day when it wouldn't. These spaces have provided both vibrant fora for   discussion as well as support systems for the marginalized. In my time at UChicago, they contributed to campus conversation with a wide array of speakers and perspectives that were often underrepresented in the Core. I can't recall a single instance in which these communities stifled free speech. The aversion to trigger warnings seems even stranger. Trigger warnings by definition prepare the reader or listener for triggering content the notion that these warnings stifle speech is unsubstantiated and farfetched. I also wonder how taking a stance against trigger warnings doesn't stifle the free speech of professors who may see value in sensitivity when introducing potentially triggering material. Finally, I wonder what kind of message a note like this sends to community members who may already be wary from recent Title IX investigations. Ellison seems to be reacting viscerally to the feeling that the marginalized have it too easy. If he was concerned about disinviting speakers, he could have said as much. Instead, he chose to bash vaguely   terms without appearing to understand them, and he strung them together into a paragraph of non sequiturs . .. all in the name of freedom. From another alum, Maira Khwaja, who graduated this past June: Dean Ellison misrepresents what trigger warnings and safe spaces have been on our campus, which are often nuanced and personalized for each professor (UChicago is nothing if not nuanced and overly verbose) and syllabi and department and extracurricular. His simplification, misrepresentation, and conflation of trigger     speakers are poor examples of the “rigorous discourse” that he boasts. In our histories of violence class, we did not shy away from any of America's most brutal understudied history, but we were given a thoughtful paragraph on the syllabus about the nature of the images and text we'd read in the archive. It'd be naive and foolish to disregard that thoughtful paragraph from our professor as something other than analysis that contributed to class discussion and understanding. Safe spaces are not made so that students can “retreat” from ideas they don't want to hear in fact, often safe spaces are built in our campus so that they can dive even further, with careful support (like support staff on hand, or respectful mutually made ground rules created) into discussions that would often be too uncomfortable for the classroom. An anonymous alum: I'm very disappointed in this admin at my former school over his nonsense about trigger warnings destroying freedom. And I love that it's a scholar at my current one so splendidly calling him out: As CUNY historian Angus Johnston notes, “There's no college in the country where profs are required to give trigger warnings. They're all voluntary pedagogical choices. Which means a professor's use of trigger warnings isn't a threat to academic freedom. It's a MANIFESTATION of academic freedom. '” Academic freedom means that professors get to design their syllabus, not administrators like Ellison. His letter is a prime example of how the outcry against “political correctness” often leads to policy changes that limit free speech.” Over the past week, my alma mater has been all over my (and probably your) news feed. The general dramatic headline: There will not be safe spaces or trigger warnings at the University of Chicago, according to a letter sent by John Ellison, dean of students at the university, to incoming freshmen. The letter immediately became a dot on the timeline of the ongoing national debate on campus politics, political correctness, and academic freedom —  the media narrative being that an administration takes a stand on free speech and academic freedom, and that's followed swiftly by support and pushback from students, experts, and pundits. I went to the University of Chicago for undergrad in the early 2000s. I studied economics and sociology, and I have very fond memories of the school's peculiar culture: the way students laughed off the bitter winters, the way pulling   at the library (shoutout to the  ) was cool, the super weird school traditions like Scavhunt —  so strange that The NYer once devoted nearly 4, 000 words to it. It's a place where people knowingly enrolled even though they've been told it's a place “where fun comes to die. ” I think we took pride in the image that we were young people who wanted to participate in school that was intellectually rigorous (the “life of the mind”) where a class about Nabokov's Lolita or Foucault's History of Sexuality were so popular it was hard to find a seat, where education was its own end, and everyone was a bit odd in their own way. I think my peers and I worried that culture (beloved by us) was starting to fade when I graduated in 2007: The school had switched from the UnCommon App to the Common App. The school started to rise in rankings, which was favorable for alumni   but we worried that it was at the cost of the school's identity and the students it would attract. The University of Chicago is about hard classes, but it's also about community.   In NY, where I live now, alumni are often   friend groups —  my    spouse regularly laments that he knows more alumni from the U of C than his own university —  that meet up regularly to have discussions not dissimilar to classes. (It's also interesting to note that some 20 percent of U of C alumni end up in academia.) With Ellison's letter, we all pondered what it's going to mean, and we did that together online. This week, I'm going to highlight some of the interesting discussions I've seen on social media and responses from the University of Chicago community. My colleague Alia Wong will join me in discussing these comments from students and alumni who share deep connections to the school and each other. For them, Ellison's letter is personal, in contrast to the way the national debate on campus politics can sometimes feel removed. From one alum, Laura Oppenheimer: I take an inordinate amount of pride in how hard I worked as a student at the U of C. My courses were not dumbed down, no one held my hand, and I was expected to read, grapple with, and discuss everything —  ranging from Plato and Marx, to Four Hours in My Lai and Night. The reading was difficult, and frequently, so was the subject matter. What I wish Ellison had said was, “as students at the University of Chicago, you will be expected to read, study and discuss many types of work, including work that may be upsetting, or work you may disagree with. This is part of a rigorous, academic education. ” Instead, he issued a blanket statement that the school doesn't give trigger warnings, which are something that serve to protect those who may have PTSD due to past trauma. To me, despite the way trigger warnings have been   by overly sensitive college students, this was a misstep. I applaud the ethos, but I wish the administration had refined the message and made it about free speech and academic discourse, focusing more on the message it was trying to deliver, and less on grabbing a moment in the spotlight. From another alum: As a 2006 graduate, I have to say I completely support Ellison's letter 100 percent.  It really surprised me a lot because I didn't expect the University to go that far in support of true free speech, since free speech is not very popular these days, especially on college campuses.  But I am very glad (and proud) that the University took such a position.  I hope that they stick to it.

",False,"Readers, staffers, and others from the University of Chicago community discuss Dean John Ellison's injunction against trigger warnings and safe spaces. If you have something to add, particularly as a professor, alumnus, or current student at the University of Chicago, please email hello@theatlantic. com. (A previous reader discussion on trigger warnings and campus politics is here.) As we sifted through responses to the famed University of Chicago letter, we figured it'd be worth spotlighting what instructors feel about the whole thing. After all, they arguably understand the impact safe spaces and trigger warnings have on the classroom better than anyone else. Educators recognize the value of challenging students intellectually they know students should, at times, feel uncomfortable with the learning material. But they also know that absolutes are dangerous   that sometimes safe spaces and trigger warnings are conducive, and not antithetical, to the robust, stimulating intellectual environment they seek. And at the end of the day, they don't like being told how to run their classroom. Here's what some current or former university instructors had to say: Andrew Dombrowski, a former university instructor who's now a counselor at the Berkeley Free Clinic, which he describes as a     oriented   collective: Safe spaces are really emphasized in our training process and I'm not going to lie, the letter took me aback at first. For us, just as a point of clarification, safe spaces involve establishing certain rules and expectations in a   manner, rather than excluding people from given backgrounds. Anyway, what I've come to realize is that when properly deployed, safe spaces can actually be actually very congruent to the values of open and rigorous intellectual inquiry   it's less about shielding people from challenging ideas, and more about encouraging people to open up and explore challenging ideas in a *more* fearless way because they don't have to worry about irrelevant stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the ideas or content under discussion. I still don't feel like I speak the language of safe spaces natively   I tend to couch these values to myself in terms like   inquiry and being a decent human being   but I don't think there has to be ANY conflict with the academic values that I remain committed to even now that I don't work in academia. I don't doubt that there are people who abuse the concept of safe spaces in order to shut people down, but those people can be criticized without lapsing into the grumble grumble grumble damn kids these days just want to be coddled stupid kids don't want to be exposed to new ideas discourse that is WAY too prevalent in this conversation. I'm very disappointed in the letter, because one of the principles of basic intellectual good practice that I learned at UChicago is to engage with the strongest reasonable form of an argument you're opposed to, not to snarkily set up a   argument in hopes that it will go viral (and let's not kid ourselves, this was done with an eye to the outside world and external publicity). That's what really bothers me here I'm less invested in the ultimate policy decision and more profoundly disappointed by the lack of intellectual rigor and honesty involved in failing to reckon with the other side. An anonymous alum: Now that I'm on the other side of the classroom, I try to create as welcoming of an intellectual space as I can. In economics we talk about some difficult issues: the gender pay gap, consequences of inequality, effects of migration, consequence of job loss, social policies such as welfare and rent control. These have the potential to be sensitive issues for the reason that the things we discuss in my classroom may have consequentially affected my students' lives outside the classroom. I always try, though I do not always succeed, to ensure that everyone feels like their voice is respected. But I don't permit any idea to be a sacred cow. That is, students will have to tolerate that others might disagree with their opinion. I require that they find a way to disagree with someone while maintaining respect for them, hopefully by employing data and facts, and not resorting to Trumpisms such as ad hominem attacks. I care much more about the process through which students come to hold their beliefs   and that throughout they maintain respect for others   than in any particular beliefs they hold. I have two experiences from teaching at an elite liberal arts school where I was accused by students of crossing the safe space line. In the first instance, I was teaching at a women's college. Two male students from a nearby university attended, so the class was approximately 90 percent female. Both of the male students were engineering students, whereas none of the female students were. In class I referenced the entrepreneur Elon Musk and got mostly blank stares but some nods from the male students. As an aside to the two male engineering students, I mentioned one of his projects. A female student later came to my office hours that week to discuss the incident. She voiced that singling out the male students in the class made the rest of the class feel uncomfortable. I thanked her for her feedback and asked her to return again if she found anything upsetting in the future. While personally I thought the student may have been overly sensitive, I appreciated the feedback. I strive to create a welcoming environment, and if there's ways I can do that better I want to know. In contrast, the other incident was handled quite differently. I was lecturing on wage setting and made the slightly indelicate comment the firm buys this worker to mean that a firm hired a worker at a given wage. A student interrupted my lecture, saying, You can't say that. They aren't slaves.  I was taken aback. Was this student suggesting that I condoned slavery? No sooner had the comment left my mouth than I realized there was a better way of phrasing it, but I didn't think it required interruption. I stumbled through the next 10 minutes of my lecture before returning to myself. Had this student come to my office and mentioned the comment I would have apologized and professed to be more careful. I left class embarrassed and, if I were honest, resentful towards the student for the interruption, whose comment I never would have been audacious enough to raise as an undergraduate. What's missing from this debate is a guideline for dialogue between students and faculty about how we can create a more welcoming classroom environment. If we want to discuss meaningful topics, students risk feeling discomfort. However, U of C's no safe space allowed mantra only gets us half the way there. The other crucial element is knowing how to resolve incidents when students feel distressed. Another anonymous alum: 1. I am largely supportive of this letter in its context as a cover letter for a longer book, which is how it was sent out. A letter to incoming freshmen does not actually set university policy that's reserved for the handbook that no one reads. 2. Trigger warnings, safe spaces, and speaker censorship are all actually different issues. 3. I am largely against university trigger warnings.  The example that is usually used is of sexual assault survivors being triggered, which most decent people immediately agree with. I would propose the more ridiculous example of someone with extreme arachnophobia. Should an instructor teaching The Lord of the Rings have to say Warning: Spiders? If not, why not? Are some traumas more    than others? 4. I am very pro insightful contextualization before a piece of media. In film class, rather than Warning: This film has rape, a sensible and sensitive instructor might say I want you to pay attention to how the stillness and position of the camera makes the audience complicit.  5. Students have the option of opting out of anything they want to. They just get penalized for it. 6. Students who have gone through the official steps of seeking accommodations (for dyslexia, ADD, PTSD, etc.) should be respected and accommodated. They are not a burden. Timothy   an associate professor of history at Rutgers: While I don't use trigger warnings in the classroom, I'd be appalled if an administrator at my own institution attempted to dictate to me or my students what they should expect from their instructors with regard to such warnings. It would abrogate my academic freedom as an instructor. In this context, Ellison's words cruelly ignore the recent and devastating history of indifference by University of Chicago administrators to marginalized students' safety. I think the University of Chicago has a fetish of the universal and a hostility toward concepts or ideas that can be construed as particular.  (For example, as a graduate student there, I taught a course that at most other institutions would be called Introduction to LGBT Studies at Chicago, it is, or at least was, called Problems in the Study of Sexuality. ) There is a concomitant sense that the heroic individual scholar can and should engage in the life of the mind, without being embedded in the messy realities of the real world. In its most troubling versions, this leads to a sense on the part of administrators that discrimination and structural oppression can be wished or willed away, or that catering to demands for inclusion would somehow be coddling.  This letter about trigger warnings  safe spaces? In my view, it's not at all motivated by actual concern about TWs and safe spaces. Continuing our series of comments from the University of Chicago community regarding Dean John Ellison's letter, some alumni and students have expressed that the move smelled, at least partially, like a publicity stunt. From one current University of Chicago student, who hints that the administration has been trying to change the image of those beloved strange dark days of the school I remember so well: To me, the whole situation reads as a poorly conceived publicity stunt. The University is in this strange moment where its undergrad exclusivity has recently shot up, and it seems to want to do everything it can to bolster its reputation. The College also attempting to rebrand through ditching the    masochism tone of prior decades and attempting to court a reputation of Fun, Exciting Academic Rigor. However, this all leaves the College without a coherent identity, and the admins pinned their hopes on riding the   wave of think pieces on the matter, which would allow them to capitalize on dissatisfaction with the Millennial bogeyman's perceived censorship problem, hostility toward the ivory tower, and the massive moderate frustrated by youth movements in general. It certainly doesn't represent any actual policy change: the University has explicitly said that this is not a blanket ban on trigger warnings, but that it still allows professors to choose what to do at their discretion. I have no idea whether it worked. It will have appealed to those forces I mentioned, but of course will also drive away prospective students involved in the   community. From another alum: Have you ever actually had a lesson plan or discussion section disrupted because students claimed they felt triggered by the material? Sometimes I find the language and the logic of the trigger warning a bit stultifying, but really that's only in the abstract because no one has ever actually invoked it. I can count the number of times a student has asked to take a step back from a set of readings or a specific conversation on one hand, and then it's with ample, generous explanation and always when we were dealing with genuinely disturbing material. I suppose this letter disappoints me because it reads like fairly blatant administrative grandstanding. More insidiously, I am afraid that it will produce the very effects that it claims it is trying to prevent   the foreclosure of a dialogue between all interested parties. And lastly, an alum questions whether the letter is speaking to the university's community and how consistent the university's administration has been on the issue: I find the letter from U of C to be somewhat embarrassing. On the surface, who can argue with academic freedom? But I take the appeal to it here to be fairly empty posturing and, more importantly, it's part of a pattern of the administration appealing to academic freedom at the same time as   or in order to   act badly. When I was an undergrad they were refusing to divest from Darfur because taking a political stance would somehow violate academic freedom. It seemed to me at the time to be a fairly transparent attempt to preserve the status quo and avoid a financial hassle   and I'm skeptical that divestment was in any way contrary to the famous Kalven Report. And we can add to this the University's treatment of protesters, including those who were agitating for a trauma unit at the hospitals and the more recent threats against the student body president who organized a  . Throw in the   letter that the president just sent, too. Appealing to academic freedom while acting this way may not be acting inconsistently, exactly, but it isn't great. What I take away from all of this is that the administrators don't care about academic freedom. They care about their  . And their interest is in propping up the speech of some and not others. In making their decisions, I have a hard time imagining these administrators sitting around thinking carefully about the meaning of academic freedom in all of its complexity and nuance. That kind of pondering was what my professors taught me at U of C. What I read is a letter with all the nuance and care of a talk radio host. I'm confident that Chicago will continue being a great school with incredible faculty and students doing amazing things. This letter contributes nothing to the quality of the institution   nor does it detract from it. It's a shadow on the wall of the cave. I wish it had been something worth our time, because these issues do matter. I don't think that trigger warnings and safe spaces are inconsistent with academic freedom   not in the least. But I don't think that this is about that   it's just an attempt at branding, as well as ignoring or silencing or marginalizing protest at the University. It sets up those that want the University to act as a better citizen (with respect to its students and the broader community) as  . And while those that protest very well might be wrong   that's debatable, for sure   I think the   slant is an insubstantial smear. If we're going to have a   conversation about trigger warnings and safe spaces, then fine. The Dean should write the kind of reasoned, deep treatment of the issues that the U of C community deserves. Yesterday, my colleague, Bourree Lam, looked at how University of Chicago alumni are responding to the   letter their alma mater sent out last week to incoming freshmen. The letter essentially warned students that the university   which for decades has espoused its commitment to freedom of expression   would not tolerate intellectual safe spaces' and   trigger warnings. ' The thinking behind the letter, presumably, is that safe spaces and trigger warnings inherently suppress free speech and academic freedom   and, in turn, that the university felt a need to defend those values. As Bourree highlighted yesterday, that premise outraged many alumni, who remember their years at the university as experiences rife with challenging and uncomfortable discussions. Others argued that the wholesale rejection of things like trigger warnings misses the point. It got us thinking: What is a trigger warning, anyway? What defines a safe space? Lots of people have questioned whether Dean of Students John Ellison, who wrote the letter, actually understands what the terms mean. My colleague, Conor Friedersdorf, chimed in on the topic this morning. Here's what some from the academic community had to say. From an alum, Audrey Truschke: I would say that the letter brought up mixed reactions from me. I wholeheartedly support the basic idea that universities ought to have a strong, unflinching commitment to academic freedom of speech, and I think numerous institutions have dangerously compromised that ideal recently. That said, I use trigger warnings periodically on syllabi. I started including them formally, as part of the written syllabus, last year when I realized that I had been doing them informally for years. For me, it always seemed to be common sense that when you find yourself, say, assigning a graphic description of rape, you might give your students a   during the prior class meeting, concerning what they are about to read. Even now, I often issue trigger warnings more informally. For instance, this past spring I sent out a podcast on female genital mutilation to my students with the caveat that they should not listen to it while driving. I had made that mistake, I told them, and nearly had to pull over at one point because it was such a hard listen and brought tears to my eyes. The point of giving due warning, for me, is not to silence debate but rather to prepare people so that they can (hopefully) move beyond their understandable initial reactions of shock, horror, disgust, and trauma and enter into an intellectual discussion of the materials and questions at hand. From another alum, Nabeel Ebeid: More than anything, I'm embarrassed. UChicago taught me to question so many assumptions and helped me to revise so many of my priors with logic and data. For the school to send its undergrads a letter without a clear definition of safe space or trigger warning, without any reference to sexual assault, harassment, or the contexts in which these words emerged, and without substantiating any link between those terms and academic freedom, Ellison is being lazy at best and, at worst, gratuitously malicious. One need not denigrate safe spaces or trigger warnings to support academic freedom or defend the right to bring controversial speakers to campus. More puzzling is that the school is full of safe spaces: the Center for Identity and Inclusion (Amandla Center in my day) worship groups, any number of campus affinity groups, etc (to say nothing of health counselors' offices). The school appears to endorse them wholeheartedly, and it's hard to imagine a day when it wouldn't. These spaces have provided both vibrant fora for   discussion as well as support systems for the marginalized. In my time at UChicago, they contributed to campus conversation with a wide array of speakers and perspectives that were often underrepresented in the Core. I can't recall a single instance in which these communities stifled free speech. The aversion to trigger warnings seems even stranger. Trigger warnings by definition prepare the reader or listener for triggering content the notion that these warnings stifle speech is unsubstantiated and farfetched. I also wonder how taking a stance against trigger warnings doesn't stifle the free speech of professors who may see value in sensitivity when introducing potentially triggering material. Finally, I wonder what kind of message a note like this sends to community members who may already be wary from recent Title IX investigations. Ellison seems to be reacting viscerally to the feeling that the marginalized have it too easy. If he was concerned about disinviting speakers, he could have said as much. Instead, he chose to bash vaguely   terms without appearing to understand them, and he strung them together into a paragraph of non sequiturs . .. all in the name of freedom. From another alum, Maira Khwaja, who graduated this past June: Dean Ellison misrepresents what trigger warnings and safe spaces have been on our campus, which are often nuanced and personalized for each professor (UChicago is nothing if not nuanced and overly verbose) and syllabi and department and extracurricular. His simplification, misrepresentation, and conflation of trigger     speakers are poor examples of the rigorous discourse that he boasts. In our histories of violence class, we did not shy away from any of America's most brutal understudied history, but we were given a thoughtful paragraph on the syllabus about the nature of the images and text we'd read in the archive. It'd be naive and foolish to disregard that thoughtful paragraph from our professor as something other than analysis that contributed to class discussion and understanding. Safe spaces are not made so that students can retreat from ideas they don't want to hear in fact, often safe spaces are built in our campus so that they can dive even further, with careful support (like support staff on hand, or respectful mutually made ground rules created) into discussions that would often be too uncomfortable for the classroom. An anonymous alum: I'm very disappointed in this admin at my former school over his nonsense about trigger warnings destroying freedom. And I love that it's a scholar at my current one so splendidly calling him out: As CUNY historian Angus Johnston notes, There's no college in the country where profs are required to give trigger warnings. They're all voluntary pedagogical choices. Which means a professor's use of trigger warnings isn't a threat to academic freedom. It's a MANIFESTATION of academic freedom. ' Academic freedom means that professors get to design their syllabus, not administrators like Ellison. His letter is a prime example of how the outcry against political correctness often leads to policy changes that limit free speech. Over the past week, my alma mater has been all over my (and probably your) news feed. The general dramatic headline: There will not be safe spaces or trigger warnings at the University of Chicago, according to a letter sent by John Ellison, dean of students at the university, to incoming freshmen. The letter immediately became a dot on the timeline of the ongoing national debate on campus politics, political correctness, and academic freedom   the media narrative being that an administration takes a stand on free speech and academic freedom, and that's followed swiftly by support and pushback from students, experts, and pundits. I went to the University of Chicago for undergrad in the early 2000s. I studied economics and sociology, and I have very fond memories of the school's peculiar culture: the way students laughed off the bitter winters, the way pulling   at the library (shoutout to the  ) was cool, the super weird school traditions like Scavhunt   so strange that The NYer once devoted nearly 4, 000 words to it. It's a place where people knowingly enrolled even though they've been told it's a place where fun comes to die.  I think we took pride in the image that we were young people who wanted to participate in school that was intellectually rigorous (the life of the mind) where a class about Nabokov's Lolita or Foucault's History of Sexuality were so popular it was hard to find a seat, where education was its own end, and everyone was a bit odd in their own way. I think my peers and I worried that culture (beloved by us) was starting to fade when I graduated in 2007: The school had switched from the UnCommon App to the Common App. The school started to rise in rankings, which was favorable for alumni   but we worried that it was at the cost of the school's identity and the students it would attract. The University of Chicago is about hard classes, but it's also about community.   In NY, where I live now, alumni are often   friend groups   my    spouse regularly laments that he knows more alumni from the U of C than his own university   that meet up regularly to have discussions not dissimilar to classes. (It's also interesting to note that some 20 percent of U of C alumni end up in academia.) With Ellison's letter, we all pondered what it's going to mean, and we did that together online. This week, I'm going to highlight some of the interesting discussions I've seen on social media and responses from the University of Chicago community. My colleague Alia Wong will join me in discussing these comments from students and alumni who share deep connections to the school and each other. For them, Ellison's letter is personal, in contrast to the way the national debate on campus politics can sometimes feel removed. From one alum, Laura Oppenheimer: I take an inordinate amount of pride in how hard I worked as a student at the U of C. My courses were not dumbed down, no one held my hand, and I was expected to read, grapple with, and discuss everything   ranging from Plato and Marx, to Four Hours in My Lai and Night. The reading was difficult, and frequently, so was the subject matter. What I wish Ellison had said was, as students at the University of Chicago, you will be expected to read, study and discuss many types of work, including work that may be upsetting, or work you may disagree with. This is part of a rigorous, academic education.  Instead, he issued a blanket statement that the school doesn't give trigger warnings, which are something that serve to protect those who may have PTSD due to past trauma. To me, despite the way trigger warnings have been   by overly sensitive college students, this was a misstep. I applaud the ethos, but I wish the administration had refined the message and made it about free speech and academic discourse, focusing more on the message it was trying to deliver, and less on grabbing a moment in the spotlight.

A particularly insightful Facebook post from alum Nasia Anam: I don't think it would be a stretch to call University of Chicago a school of intellectual hard knocks.

117,58412,80093,What Syria's Tourism Office Isn't Telling You,Atlantic,Yasmeen Serhan,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , NEWS BRIEF The Syrian Ministry of Tourism released a new promotional video of the coastal city of Tartus, featuring its expansive Mediterranean coastline, packed beaches, and lush green landscapes.   But the video fails to capture one thing: the country's   civil war. The     video titled “Syria —  Always Beautiful,” set to an upbeat remix of Alan Walker's “Faded,” was one of many videos posted to the ministry's YouTube page in recent weeks in an apparent effort to entice tourists to visit areas of the   country still under the control of President Bashar  's regime. Although the aerial footage of the bustling beach town gives viewers a sense of Syria's   tourism industry —  the country welcomed 8. 5 million visitors in 2010 —   it provides a stark contrast to what Tartus has since become. Five years into the civil war, which has claimed the lives of almost half a million people and displaced millions, the city has been bombarded by the ISIS, including an attack that killed 150 people and wounded 200 others in May. Local Syrian news outlet   News notes that the coastal enclave depicted in the video has been “virtually been untouched by the war. ” But such assurances are unlikely to convince the numerous countries that have issued travel warnings to their citizens asking them to avoid visiting the country. “No part of Syria should be considered safe from violence,” the U. S. State Department says on its website. “The potential for hostile acts exists throughout the country, including kidnappings and the use of chemical warfare against civilians. ” Prior to the start of the civil war, foreign tourism accounted for 14 percent of Syria's gross domestic product, Bloomberg reports. The country was a popular tourist destination for its numerous historic monuments, many of which have been designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. One tourist spot, the city of Palmyra, saw many of its ancient ruins destroyed by ISIS militants this year.

According to the football program's promotional calendar, the September 17 game will include a “commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Coach Joe Paterno. ” Paterno's first game as head coach was September 17, 1966. The announcement prompted outrage on social media. Joe Paterno, who died in January 2012 at age 85, served as head football coach for 46 years and was considered a beacon of integrity in the   world of NCAA football. But that changed in 2011, when it was revealed Paterno helped cover up years of child sex abuse by his assistant coach. In November 2011, Jerry Sandusky, who left his Penn State coaching position in 1999, was arrested and charged with dozens of counts of sexual abuse of young boys from 1994 to 2009. Paterno and Penn State's president were fired days later. According to an investigation of the abuse, the beloved “Joe Pa” knew that Sandusky had sexually assaulted boys and did not report him. Court documents unsealed in July revealed that the abuse was reported to Paterno as early as 1976, but the coach took no action. Sandusky was convicted in 2012 and is currently serving 30 to 60 years in state prison.

119,58415,80096,The Retirement of a Dallas Police Chief ,Atlantic,Laura Wagner,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , NEWS BRIEF Dallas Police Chief David Brown, who helped guide the city after a gunman killed five law enforcement officers last month during protests against fatal police shootings, announced his retirement Thursday. “Serving the citizens of Dallas in this noble profession has been both a true honor and a humbling experience,” Brown said in a statement. The   veteran of the city's police department said he will leave the job October 22. He also offered a tribute to the slain officers: Let's always remember the fallen officers including the five officers on July 7, 2016, and the brave men and women of the Dallas Police Department for their sacrifices to keep Dallas safe.  Their memory will remain with all of us forever.  I know the people of Dallas will never forget the ultimate sacrifice they made on the streets of our city that awful night. Brown became a recognizable figure in national news after Micah Johnson, a    black man, fatally shot five officers in Dallas during a protest against recent police killings of black men. Before he was killed by police, Johnson told officers he was upset by the fatal shootings of  Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castille in Minnesota, and had specifically targeted white members of law enforcement. On the morning after the shootings, Brown gave a press conference calling for unity. “We're hurting. Our profession is hurting. Dallas officers are hurting. We are heartbroken. There are no words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city,” Brown, who is black, said. “All I know is this: This must stop, this divisiveness between our police and our citizens. ” In the days after the shooting, Brown also spoke repeatedly about the need for police reform, stricter federal gun laws, and more resources for police departments across the country. According to The Washington Post, during a briefing on July 11 Brown said: We're asking cops to do too much in this country. We are. Every societal failure, we put it off on the cops to solve. Not enough mental health funding, let the cops handle it.   …     Here in Dallas we got a loose dog problem let's have the cops chase loose dogs. Schools fail, let's give it to the cops.   …     That's too much to ask. Policing was never meant to solve all those problems. Brown addressed protesters' perception of police as biased, too. He said, per NPR: We're in a much better place than we were when I was a young man here, but we have much work to do, particularly in our profession. Leaders in my position need to put their careers on the line to make sure we do things    be so worried about keeping their job. That's how I approach it. I hope that's an example for others to approach, the way we conduct ourselves as police officers. He called on those protesting police practices to join the force themselves, saying, “We're hiring. Get off that protest line and put an application in. We'll put you in your neighborhood, and we will help you resolve some of the problems you're protesting about.” Brown's life was marked by tragedy long before the Dallas police shootings. Brown's son fatally shot two men in 2010, one of whom was a police officer, and then was shot and killed by other officers. More than two decades earlier, in 1988, Brown's police academy classmate and former partner Walter Williams was shot and killed while on duty. Brown's younger brother, Kelvin Brown, was killed in Phoenix by drug dealers three years later, according to the Dallas Morning News. Brown said Thursday the decision to retire “difficult” and thanked the city for the opportunity to serve. “I became a Dallas cop in 1983 because of the crack cocaine epidemic's impact on my neighborhood in Oak Cliff. I wanted to be part of the solution,” he said. “Since that time I have taken great pride in knowing that we have always been part of the solution and helped to make Dallas the world class city it is today. ” 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY.",False,"        , NEWS BRIEF Dallas Police Chief David Brown, who helped guide the city after a gunman killed five law enforcement officers last month during protests against fatal police shootings, announced his retirement Thursday.

120,58416,80097,Clinton Has a Lot of Money,Atlantic,Russell Berman,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , If Clinton loses in November, it won't be for lack of money. The Clinton campaign announced on Thursday that the Democratic nominee raised a total of $143 million in August for her campaign and the national and state Democratic parties. Those accounts begin September with a combined $152 million in the bank. By any measure, that is an enormous amount of cash. Her haul in August is more than 50 percent higher than both the total that Clinton raised in July and that Obama, himself a prodigious fundraiser, collected during the same period four years ago. It also all but ensures that Clinton will maintain her considerable money advantage over Trump, who began far behind after not mounting a traditional fundraising operation during the Republican primaries. Trump, who collected $82 million for his campaign and the Republicans during a strong showing in July, has not released his numbers for August. Clinton has now raised more than $400 million during her presidential run. Will Trump Hand State Capitols to Democrats? What may be most significant about Clinton's total, however, is not the $62 million she raised for her own campaign but the $81 million she took in for the Democratic National Committee and state parties. That portion dwarfs what Obama and Mitt Romney raised for their parties during this period four years ago. And it signals an aggressive effort by Clinton to extend her coattails far down the ballot as Democrats try to take back control of Congress, governorships, and state legislative chambers that they lost during the Obama era. “Trump's divisive rhetoric continues to drive voters away from him and the Republicans and has created new opportunities for Democrats up and down the ticket,” Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said in a statement. “These resources will help us to register and turnout millions of voters to elect progressive candidates across the country. ” Money for the state parties typically goes to turnout operations on the ground, adding to the advantage that Democrats have over Trump, who has opened relatively few field offices and is relying heavily on the organizing efforts of the Republican National Committee. Clinton is dominating Trump in the number of television ads she's run, and her early fundraising strength allowed her to reserve air time for the fall at lower rates than Trump will be able to get in the campaign's final stretch. Riding a wave of strong poll numbers after the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, Clinton devoted a big part of the month to fundraising. She held fewer campaign events than Trump and attended dozens of   events. Her campaign said more than 2. 7 million people have now contributed to her bid, but the focus on   donors has raised the average contribution to $50 —  nearly twice the $27 average that Bernie Sanders famously boasted about during his primary run. If the goal was simply to bring in a lot of cash, however, Clinton's announcement on Thursday suggests her August fundraising push paid off.

121,58417,80098,Trump's Immigration Speech Backfires Among Hispanic Republicans,Atlantic,Priscilla Alvarez,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , Trump's hard turn on immigration in a speech in Arizona on Wednesday has sparked a sense of betrayal among members of  his Hispanic Advisory Council, who had hoped to see a more compassionate approach to immigration. “We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall,” Trump said. He added: “Within ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Clinton has evaded justice, OK?” God vs. the Federal Election Commission, Former Trump Hispanic Adviser and a member of the council Jacob Monty resigned shortly after the Arizona speech. “I was a strong supporter of Trump when I believed he was going to address the immigration problem realistically and compassionately,” he said, according to Politico. “What I heard today was not realistic and not compassionate. ” Politico also reported that Alfonso Aguilar, the president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, had not yet reached a decision about stepping down from the group, but conceded: “We feel misled. ” Tony Suarez, the executive vice president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference and member of Trump's Evangelical advisory board, said in an interview, “I have more questions than I do answers,” in light of Wednesday's speech. Late last month Trump met with his new National Hispanic Advisory Council to solicit advice from Hispanic leaders. During the gathering the Republican nominee signaled that he might soften his approach on immigration. But days later, the initiative appears to have flopped, with several members of the council venting frustrations with the nominee and reportedly reconsidering their involvement with the group. The news comes only a day after Trump made a   trip to Mexico to meet with the country's president, Enrique Peña Nieto. Trump's harsh stance on immigration, a cornerstone of his presidential campaign, wavered in recent days, creating confusion about his position altogether. Trump and Peña Nieto's news conference in Mexico City on Wednesday did little to remedy that. For one, neither of the two men elaborated on who would pay for the border wall. “We didn't discuss it,” Trump said, when asked —   —  but Peña Nieto later said in a statement that he told Trump Mexico would not pay for the wall. Trump has long said that Mexico would foot the bill. Despite what appeared to be a cordial meeting, Trump reverted back to his regular immigration points in Arizona Wednesday night: Mexico would pay for the wall, pledged mass deportations, and said there would be “no amnesty. ” Leslie Sanchez reported a number of Trump's Hispanic advisory board planned to step down on Thursday: Hispanic leader who advises Trump camp telling me half of Trump's Hispanic advisory board is ready to resign today (15 of 30) She later posted a revision, saying the group “never had more than 23 members. ” Suarez said that members of the Hispanic advisory board felt “really disappointed. ” “They're not at a place that they can continue (to support Trump) and I respect it,” he said. “They don't see any hope after yesterday's speech. ” The resignation rumors are only the latest sign of the Republicans's troubles with outreach to Latinos. The head of Hispanic media relations at the Republican National Committee, Ruth Guerra, resigned earlier this year because, according to The NY Times, she felt “uncomfortable” working for Trump. And in Florida, Wadi Gaitan, who led the communications department for the state's Republican party, stepped down to join the LIBRE Initiative.  Trump's divisive rhetoric about Hispanics and immigration poses a conundrum for Hispanic Republicans, who may support a more hawkish border stance but are finding it difficult to grapple with Trump's rhetoric about the Hispanic community. The Republican nominee has struggled to woo minority voters time and time again —  an impediment to the Republicans which pledged in its 2012 autopsy report to put more emphasis on Hispanic voters. Polling shows 24 percent of Hispanic registered voters support Trump, leaving him slightly behind Mitt Romney's 27 percent support in 2012. This could hurt Trump most in battleground states like Florida, which has an increasingly diverse electorate. To be sure, immigration is one of the top issues concerning Hispanic voters, among jobs and the economy and education. But rather than reaching out to Latino voters, Trump's approach to immigration has left his Latino supporters so insulted that many of them are no longer willing to back his campaign.

122,58418,80099,God vs. the Federal Election Commission,Atlantic,Clare Foran,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , The Federal Election Commission has a few questions for God, Satan, and the Ghost of Ronald Reagan, all of whom have filed paperwork to run for office this election cycle. How Colin Kaepernick's Protest Misfired, This implausible scenario is part of a policy aimed at dealing with an influx of   presidential candidate names. It's relatively easy to register as a presidential candidate, and during the 2016 election plenty of people seem to be taking advantage of that. As a result, the federal agency is now asking whoever filed paperwork to run for president under the names “God,” “Satan,” and “Ronald Reagan's Ghost” to prove they actually exist. “It has come to the attention of the Federal Election Commission that you may have failed to include an accurate candidate name,” a letter sent by the commission to “H. Majesty Satan Lord of Underworld Prince of Darkness!” in College Station, Texas dated August 31, 2016 reads. “The Commission requires the filing to be true, correct and complete,” the letter warns, adding that “knowingly and willfully making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation to a federal government agency, including the Federal Election Commission, is punishable. ” A wide array of individuals listed as presidential candidates in the agency directory don't seem like they could possibly be real. To name a few: Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker,   Picard, Captain Crunch, Queen Elsa, and Francis Underwood. Several of these supposed candidates have received letters asking for proof of existence. It's one thing for a federal agency to demand proof of existence from a fictional character. Asking God and Satan to prove that they are real seems far more metaphysical. ”This election cycle has seen a huge increase in the number of fake presidential candidates filing paperwork with the FEC,” said Brett Kappel, a   lawyer and partner in the Washington, D. C. office of Akerman LLP. ”In previous election cycles the FEC would get a few dozen such filings.  This cycle they have received hundreds.” It's hard to say how much time and effort the agency wastes sifting through paperwork intended as a prank. Broadly speaking, the FEC is tasked with regulating money in politics, a responsibility that includes looking into and, in theory, taking action when campaign finance violations occur. But the agency is often criticized as relatively toothless. Agency commissioner Ann Ravel has even gone so far as to say that the agency is “worse than dysfunctional. ” God, Satan and Ronald Reagan's Ghost have 30 days to respond with proof of their existence, or their candidacy will be removed from the agency website. “If the information you submitted   …     is, to the best of your knowledge and belief, true, correct, and complete, please file a response to confirm this,” the letter to Satan Lord of Underworld Prince of Darkness reads. “Failure to respond within 30 calendar days of the date of this correspondence will result in the Commission removing your FEC Form 2 and related committee filings. ” What else do we know about these elusive candidates? “God” originally registered as a Republican. Satan also opted to register as a Republican. Ronald Reagan's Ghost meanwhile is registered as an Independent. Trump often talks up the fact that he's a political outsider, but it's hard to imagine what could be more of an outsider than being undead, a deity, or a devil.

The Commission requires the filing to be true, correct and complete, the letter warns, adding that knowingly and willfully making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation to a federal government agency, including the Federal Election Commission, is punishable.  A wide array of individuals listed as presidential candidates in the agency directory don't seem like they could possibly be real. To name a few: Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker,   Picard, Captain Crunch, Queen Elsa, and Francis Underwood. Several of these supposed candidates have received letters asking for proof of existence. It's one thing for a federal agency to demand proof of existence from a fictional character. Asking God and Satan to prove that they are real seems far more metaphysical. This election cycle has seen a huge increase in the number of fake presidential candidates filing paperwork with the FEC, said Brett Kappel, a   lawyer and partner in the Washington, D. C. office of Akerman LLP. In previous election cycles the FEC would get a few dozen such filings.  This cycle they have received hundreds. It's hard to say how much time and effort the agency wastes sifting through paperwork intended as a prank. Broadly speaking, the FEC is tasked with regulating money in politics, a responsibility that includes looking into and, in theory, taking action when campaign finance violations occur. But the agency is often criticized as relatively toothless. Agency commissioner Ann Ravel has even gone so far as to say that the agency is worse than dysfunctional.  God, Satan and Ronald Reagan's Ghost have 30 days to respond with proof of their existence, or their candidacy will be removed from the agency website. If the information you submitted        is, to the best of your knowledge and belief, true, correct, and complete, please file a response to confirm this, the letter to Satan Lord of Underworld Prince of Darkness reads. Failure to respond within 30 calendar days of the date of this correspondence will result in the Commission removing your FEC Form 2 and related committee filings.  What else do we know about these elusive candidates? God originally registered as a Republican. Satan also opted to register as a Republican. Ronald Reagan's Ghost meanwhile is registered as an Independent. Trump often talks up the fact that he's a political outsider, but it's hard to imagine what could be more of an outsider than being undead, a deity, or a devil.

124,58420,80101,How Colin Kaepernick's Protest Misfired,Atlantic,Peter Beinart,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , I admire Colin Kaepernick. I admire his courage in doing what he thinks is right even though it could cost him money and perhaps his job. You don't see that from public figures very often. I admire him for raising awareness about police brutality. I also admire the veterans who have defended him by arguing, correctly, that they are defending his right to sit or stand when the national anthem plays. That's what living in a free country means. God vs. the Federal Election Commission, But it's one thing to defend Kaepernick's right to protest and to applaud his outrage over   racism. It's another to believe that his particular form of protest is wise. Throughout American history, the most effective protests have embraced American symbols and demanded that America's government live up to the ideals those symbols are supposed to represent. As the early   socialist Norman Thomas famously advised his fellow radicals, “Don't burn the flag, wash it. ” Sitting for the national anthem is like burning the flag. By rejecting a core national symbol, you're symbolically rejecting the nation itself. You're implying that America is impervious to reform, corrupt and evil at its core. That's different than going on TV to denounce police violence or donning an “I Can't Breathe”   on the court like LeBron James. Professional football players occupy an unusual place in American society because the NFL is one of the few institutions that are embraced equally by Americans on both sides of the partisan divide. Since 1994, according to the Pew Research Center, the percentage of Democrats and Republicans who hold “strongly negative” views of the other party has more than doubled. And this partisan alienation increasingly structures how Americans live. As the Washington Post's Aaron Blake puts it, Americans are “gerrymandering themselves” along ideological lines. Liberals choose smaller houses in diverse urban areas where there's lots of opportunity to walk. Conservatives choose bigger houses in small towns or rural areas where neighbors share their religious faith. The sorting isn't only geographic. Studies show that liberals eat at Au Bon Pain and California Pizza Kitchen. Conservatives favor Cracker Barrel and Whataburger. Democrats buy their groceries at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, Republicans at Randall's. Democrats don't just watch MSNBC. They also watch Comedy Central and Bravo. Conservatives don't just watch Fox News. They also watch Country Music Television and the motor   Speed Channel. Even the reaction to Hollywood action movies can break down along partisan lines. Earlier this year, when Columbia Pictures' remake of Ghostbusters featured an   cast of heroes, the   declared war on the film, and progressives rallied to its defense. As Bill Bishop, author of The Big Sort, writes, “We've built a country where we can all choose the neighborhood and church and news   compatible with our lifestyle and beliefs. And we are living with the consequences of this    segregation. Our country has become so polarized, so ideologically inbred, that people don't know and can't understand those who live just a few miles away. ” Professional sports, and especially professional football, represent an exception to this trend. Put a liberal Democrat and a conservative Republican in a room, especially if they're men, and ask them to find a shared cultural vocabulary and they're likely to start discussing the NFL. Soccer may be more popular among liberals, golf and auto racing among conservatives. But with its mass appeal, the NFL overwhelms these ideological distinctions. Monday Night Football may be the 21st century's closest equivalent to Walter Cronkite. I'm not suggesting that in order to keep the NFL nonpartisan, professional football players should never express a political thought. To the contrary, athletes —  especially African American athletes —  have a unique opportunity to use the prestige they enjoy with conservative white Americans to make those Americans face racism and injustice. If you're a Donald   Rush   Republican in the Denver suburbs, it's a lot easier to demonize and disregard Obama than Von Miller. But that makes it all the more important that athletes speak in a way that can be heard. Khizr Khan's speech at the Democratic Convention was so effective because he claimed America's symbols —  the Constitution, Arlington National Cemetery, his son's military sacrifice —  and accused Trump of disrespecting them with his   bigotry. Colin Kaepernick, by contrast, is exposing himself to the charge of disrespect. I don't doubt his motives or his courage. But tactically, there's a better way.

125,58421,80102,Farewell to Superheroes: A Fall-Movie Preview,Atlantic,David Sims,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , This might be hard to believe, but over the next two months of cinema releases, there's not one superhero in sight. Sure, there are a couple remakes, a   sequel, and even an attempt to start a   franchise, but the fall movie season looks to be a distinct improvement from the summer. So far, 2016 has been a mixed year for Hollywood: While dollar revenues are steady thanks to inflation and 3D upcharges, actual ticket sales are at their lowest rate in history, and a   summer of   franchise flops and sequels did nothing to help that. The question now is whether a slate of literary adaptations,   recreations, and yes, eventually a   superhero (hello, Doctor Strange!) will be enough to drive audience interest. The fall kicks off with the stodgiest   of them all, Clint Eastwood's Sully (September 9) a stirring drama that sees Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) land a plane on the Hudson River after catastrophic engine failure, then suffer through a press conference or two. It's the kind of true story that typically appeals in awards season, but outside of the plane crash itself, there's not a whole lot of drama to this one. (Put it this way: There's a reason it's only one hour and 35 minutes long.) The true stories keep coming with Snowden (September 16) Oliver Stone's take on a more exciting figure in recent history, the former NSA contractor and whistleblower (Joseph  ). Stone hasn't had a hit in years, but in theory, the conspiratorial nature of Snowden's story should fit his milieu perfectly. The rest of September is a mixed bag of nostalgia. Bridget Jones's Baby (September 16) is a    third entry in the Bridget Jones saga, with Renee Zellweger returning to the big screen for the first time in six years to choose between Colin Firth and Patrick Dempsey. Blair Witch (September 16) is a   to the 1999 horror phenomenon that sees the brother of poor Heather Donohue (hers was the tearful face that became synonymous with The Blair Witch Project) trying to find her in the woods. The Magnificent Seven (September 23) is a new take on the classic Western (and, in turn, the Kurosawa classic Seven Samurai) this time starring Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, and Ethan Hawke as a ragtag group of cowboys enlisted to save a town from evildoers. Antoine Fuqua, who has updated King Arthur and The Equalizer with mixed results, directs. It's not just a month of nostalgia for old hit movies, though. Deepwater Horizon (September 30) takes viewers all the way back to the halcyon days of 2010 and the disastrous oil rig explosion that led to one of the worst environmental disasters in history. It's directed by Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights, Lone Survivor) who excels at tales of   folk doing gritty work, and stars Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, and John Malkovich. In lighter fare, there's Disney's Queen of Katwe (September 23) a sports biography about the Ugandan chess prodigy Phiona Mutesi (played by the newcomer Madina Nalwanga) David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong'o  . Andrea Arnold's American Honey (September 30) a   road trip drama starring Shia LaBeouf and Riley Keough, has drawn raves for its energetic style and won the Cannes Jury Prize. Finally, Tim Burton adapts the   series Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (September 30) in a play for a new Harry   franchise, this one starring Eva Green as the headmistress of a school of magical youngsters. In October, Oscar season really kicks off with the debut of Nate Parker's The Birth of a Nation (October 7) a retelling of Nat Turner's 1831 slave rebellion that drew plaudits at the Sundance Film Festival and was acquired by Fox Searchlight for a record $17. 5 million. (The film's buzz has since been overshadowed by the horrifying details of a past rape allegation against Parker.) The adaptation of the novel The Girl on the Train (October 7) starring Emily Blunt, seems to be aiming for viewers who enjoyed the similarly thrilling Gone Girl, but can the director Tate Taylor (The Help) bring the same kind of artistry to a hit potboiler that David Fincher did two years ago? Meanwhile, Ben Affleck has moved on to an even darker role in The Accountant (October 14) where he plays an autistic math savant who keeps the books of dangerous criminal organizations, and gets caught up in a web of intrigue. Gavin O'Connor (Warrior, Jane Got a Gun) directs. Tom Cruise continues his career reinvention (one in which he only appears in reliable action sequels) with Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (October 21) which will suffer from the loss of Werner Herzog, such an oddly compelling villain in the 2012 original. Ewan McGregor is also making a play for reinvention, but as a writer and director, adapting one of Philip Roth's greatest novels, American Pastoral (October 21) and starring as “Swede” Levov, a Jewish businessman whose daughter Merry (Dakota Fanning) is drawn into a frightening world of   radicalism. The promising young American director Barry Jenkins, who made the underseen delight Medicine for Melancholy, has drawn raves for Moonlight (October 21) a drama about a gay, young African American man trying to find his place in the world. The acclaimed Korean director Park   whose foray into Hollywood was the appealing thriller Stoker, is back in his homeland with The Handmaiden (October 21) an erotic psychological thriller set in the 1930s. If you're looking for sillier fare, there's always Inferno (October 28) where Dan Brown's heroic cryptologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) tries to unravel yet another medieval conspiracy, this time in Florence, Italy. It's possible the director Ron Howard and Hanks just wanted to take a vacation to the Mediterranean, but the film looks set to make a fortune worldwide no matter what. Come November, audiences will get a Marvel superhero in the form of Doctor Strange (November 4) starring Benedict Cumberbatch as the trippy sorcerer supreme, which promises to be slightly darker fare thanks to its fall release date and its director, the   vet Scott Derrickson. Mel Gibson is attempting another comeback with Hacksaw Ridge (November 4) a World War II drama about the conscientious objector and Medal of Honor winner Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield). Gibson has always been a thrilling director of action, but it remains to be seen whether that will be enough for audiences to put aside his long and checkered history. Another major Oscar player dropping that week is Jeff Nichols's   drama Loving (November 4) about the plaintiffs in the 1967 Supreme Court case that legalized interracial marriage around the country the film, starring Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga, drew warm praise at Cannes. It seems every    director these days tries to make a   drama (Nichols, in fact, did so just this year with Midnight Special). For Denis Villeneuve, who's made his mark with dramas like Prisoners and Sicario, that's Arrival (November 11) an   work starring Amy Adams about a linguist trying to communicate with a mysterious race of aliens. Perhaps just as ambitious is Ang Lee's Iraq War epic Billy Flynn's Long Halftime Walk (November 11) an adaptation of Ben Fountain's   novel that was shot in an unprecedented 120 frames per second (the usual speed is 24). That should give it an unusual visual pop if nothing else, something Lee (whose last film was Life of Pi) excels at. Perhaps the biggest Oscar player of all is Kenneth Lonergan's Manchester by the Sea (November 18) a sober family drama starring Casey Affleck and Kyle Chandler that drew acclaim at Sundance, where it premiered out of competition and was picked up by Amazon. Finally, as Thanksgiving rolls around, the franchises fire up again, including the Harry   which has been dormant since the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 in 2011.

126,58422,80103,A Favela's Funky Farewell to Brazil's Ousted President,Atlantic,Catherine Osborn,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , RIO DE JANEIRO —  On August 31, Brazil made the end of 13 years of Worker's Party (PT) rule official. By a count of   the senate voted to impeach Dilma Rousseff, the country's first female president, for manipulating the federal budget to conceal deficits. Rousseff's opponents viewed Wednesday's news as an indictment of her disastrous management of the economy, and as a necessary change amid the massive corruption scandal surrounding   oil company Petrobras. But her supporters have labelled her impeachment a “parliamentary coup,” since many of the very politicians supporting the charges against her have been officially implicated in the Petrobras probe, unlike Rousseff herself. The PT leaves behind a mixed legacy, as well as substantial pockets of support for its progressive social policies, particularly among the poor. The party's investments in infrastructure, its university   policies, and Bolsa Família, its popular   program that offered financial assistance to needy families, helped boost its standing among the working class, even as the   tide crested in recent months. An April poll by the group DataFolha found 47 percent of Brazilians in the country's lowest income bracket (a  family income of up to roughly $540 U. S. dollars per month) said Rousseff's predecessor, PT   Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was the best president Brazil ever had. The End of Dilma Rousseff's Presidency, After the vote, Rousseff defiantly slammed her impeachment as a sexist, homophobic, racist coup. She also addressed those who had vaulted into the middle class during the country's     boom years. “I'm speaking principally to the Brazilians who, during my government, overcame misery, accomplished the dream of having their own house, started to get medical attention, entered into university, and stopped being invisible in the eyes of the nation, moving toward having rights that were always denied them,” she said. “We accomplished, with success, a project that brought about the biggest social inclusion and reduction of inequalities in the history of the country. ” As Rousseff's odds of escaping impeachment dwindled, Rocinha, the largest favela in Rio, resigned itself to the reality of life under the government of the     Michel Temer, Rousseff's replacement and former vice president, who many residents I spoke to fear will erode labor protections and deprioritize health and education spending. In their eyes, the business and political elites in his coalition, led by the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) have disregarded the   costs of impeachment for the poor, as they scrambled to leverage the Petrobras scandal and Brazil's sputtering economy for their own political gain. They worry about Temer's suspension of a government program to combat illiteracy, and his plans to reportedly expand the use of private prisons his allies in the   “bullet caucus,” a bloc of   lawmakers in Brazil's congress, hope to see expanded access to firearms nationwide. On August 28, the Sunday before Rousseff's impeachment, Rocinha was the site of “Funk Without Fear,” a politically themed party featuring funk carioca, a popular genre of irreverent electronic dance music. The neighborhood of some 100, 000 saw its fortunes rise under Rousseff and the PT's 13 years in power, with more of its residents able to attend university, open small businesses, and even purchase satellite TV dishes. Hence it was a logical site for what was, effectively, a wake for the party's political legacy. “For all the problems with the PT,” said the    event planner Michelle Lacerda, “it consistently gave us a lifeline here. ” The newly installed Temer promises to enact economic reforms that will improve the livelihoods of working Brazilians. “I just don't believe he'll govern in the full public interest, because his mandate doesn't come from the people,” Lacerda said. She pointed out that one of Temer's reforms, so far, has been to give federal judges a 41 percent raise. The main objective of “Funk Without Fear,” according to its organizers, was to protest the government of Temer (himself accused in   testimony of requesting bribes. He has been banned from running for public office for eight years for violating campaign finance laws). Why funk? Fillipe Dos Anjos, secretary of the Federation of Favela Associations of Rio, an advocacy group for favela residents across the city, explained that the genre “is uniquely Rio and it came out of Rio's favelas, which stand to lose dramatically with this impeachment. ” Dos Anjos, a    former navy member who lives in the favela of Santo Amaro and studies history at the State University of Rio, hoped the event would show that favelas are determined to be heard at a time when an icon of the Brazilian left is on life support. “Rio funk is about showing that creativity and solidarity are what make favelas great —  things that money alone can't buy,” he said. Funk, then, offered an appropriate, rambunctious soundtrack for the end of Rousseff. What lay ahead with Temer was uncertain.    While plans for Sunday's event began auspiciously, things soon took an ominous turn. By midday, a    sound system had been set up inside the   futsal, or miniature soccer court, at one entrance to Rocinha. “The intention is: Fill up the futsal court and have people dancing in the street,” MC Galo, a funk artist from the community, said. Organizers and local police commanders had sparred earlier in the week over the right to host the event, which organizers called a peaceful assembly, permitted under Rio state law. But the police said it required more paperwork, despite giving their verbal authorization. Festival organizers decided to speak directly with police on Sunday to see what size performance might be possible, but on site, “an officer told organizers if we turned on that sound system inside the futsal court, Rio's elite military police squad would invade the event, attack the band, and throw pepper spray on the crowd,” Galo said. Eventually, organizers were allowed to blast music from a speaker placed in the street running adjacent to the futsal court. Soon, residents streamed toward the sound as the emcees launched into their set: an anthem to favelas, a song decrying the daily violence of the war on drugs, and another repudiating police suppression of funk parties. The crowd of over 200 danced to classic '90s hits like “The Gorilla Dance,” belted the hymn of a Rio soccer team popular among the working class, and chanted “Out With Temer!” After issuing an appeal for an end to violence in favelas, one emcee led a simple    chant of “I want to live!” Thirty meters away, over a dozen police stood watch over the event. Three carried rifles. The Rio police declined   to answer questions about the police's attempted prohibition of the event. In an email, a police spokeswoman wrote that the solicitation for the event “did not follow some demands from a 2015 city decree about requirements for events in favelas. ” To Guilherme Pimentel, a lawyer who volunteers with a group providing legal support to funk artists, the attempt was typical behavior for Rio's PMDB state government, which “sends in the police as a reaction to issues that should have other solutions,” thus in his view “criminalizing poverty. ” Pimentel said “arbitrary prohibitions of freedom of expression” are a relic of Brazil's authoritarian past —  a past he fears may prove resurgent under Temer. Yet, it was the PT that caved on its promises to rein in the police and offer a vision for public security more respectful of human rights. In 2008, the party worked with the PMDB to institute the police pacification program, which sought to use   strategies to improve relations between the police and poor communities. But the program faltered due to budgetary cuts, leadership lapses, and the resistance of powerful,    local lawmakers. In an infamous case in 2013, officers in Rocinha tortured and killed Lacerda's uncle, a bricklayer. The PT, favela residents soon realized, would not be the party to finally change a police force long symbolic of the state's past as a military dictatorship.    Backsliding on police reform was just one element of the PT's conservative shift. Over the years, it pushed its agenda through Brazil's fractious congress by relying on its alliance with the PMDB, gradually pulling away from its leftist base. It yielded to increasingly powerful   pressure in Brazil, which also led Rousseff to back a   austerity regime after her 2014 reelection, further alienating the party's base and leading to the country's current political turmoil. As Sunday's funk event rolled into its fourth hour, MC Leonardo, who was born in Rocinha, drew rapt attention with a song written a few years after the launch of the favela pacification program, when it began to draw criticism for abuses. The DJ paused so Leonardo could cry out, a cappella. “People are planting seeds of ill, wanting to harvest something good,” he said. “It's all wrong. ” 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY.",False,"        , RIO DE JANEIRO   On August 31, Brazil made the end of 13 years of Worker's Party (PT) rule official. By a count of   the senate voted to impeach Dilma Rousseff, the country's first female president, for manipulating the federal budget to conceal deficits. Rousseff's opponents viewed Wednesday's news as an indictment of her disastrous management of the economy, and as a necessary change amid the massive corruption scandal surrounding   oil company Petrobras. But her supporters have labelled her impeachment a parliamentary coup, since many of the very politicians supporting the charges against her have been officially implicated in the Petrobras probe, unlike Rousseff herself. The PT leaves behind a mixed legacy, as well as substantial pockets of support for its progressive social policies, particularly among the poor. The party's investments in infrastructure, its university   policies, and Bolsa Famlia, its popular   program that offered financial assistance to needy families, helped boost its standing among the working class, even as the   tide crested in recent months. An April poll by the group DataFolha found 47 percent of Brazilians in the country's lowest income bracket (a  family income of up to roughly $540 U. S. dollars per month) said Rousseff's predecessor, PT   Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, was the best president Brazil ever had.

There's been a 35 percent increase in the number of people using marijuana since 2002 —  from 6. 2 percent of people over the age of 12 that year to 8. 4 percent in 2014, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the CDC. And the number of people using marijuana daily or almost daily, though still a relatively small 2. 5 percent of the population, has nearly doubled. Two and a half million Americans aged 12 or older used marijuana for the first time in 2014, the most recent year the CDC studied. That's an average of 7, 000 new pot users every day —  1, 000 more than there were in 2002. Meanwhile, slightly fewer   to    are smoking weed: There's been a 10 percent decrease in   marijuana use among that group since 2002. This is despite the fact, the CDC notes, that teens are now less likely to perceive “great risk” from smoking marijuana. The biggest rise in marijuana use —  a 65 percent jump —  was seen among those older than 26. The findings suggest that as marijuana laws are relaxing, people perceive the drug to be less harmful. Since 2002, the number of people who think of the drug as very risky has declined, and now, just a quarter of Americans think so. People are also more likely now to believe there would be no penalty for being caught with marijuana, and they're less likely to fear they'd get jail time. Marijuana Use in Adults, As more people view marijuana as a relatively safe drug, they're more likely to try it. Since 2002, the CDC found, Americans have become more likely to buy weed and less likely to get it for free or share it. A Lancet Psychiatry study on adult marijuana use, also out this week, showed that Americans began to perceive less harm from marijuana use around 2007, at which point 12 states had legalized medical marijuana. That study also found no increase in “marijuana use disorders,” or feeling dependent on pot, despite a rise in use.   The CDC findings don't necessarily imply that legalization has no effect on teen pot use, since many states didn't legalize medical or recreational marijuana until 2014. Still, the fact that teens don't seem to be smoking weed in greater numbers —   even though the adults around them are —  is positive news for the   movement, since concerns over teen pot use is a common argument against relaxing pot laws.

129,58425,80106,Being the Person Behind the Badge,Atlantic,Adrienne Green,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , Camden, New Jersey, has long had a reputation as one of the most dangerous cities in America. In 2012, the city made an unprecedented move by terminating its entire   police force in favor of hiring   workers supervised by the county. Officials at that time said that union contracts, in a city with a major lack of revenue, made it financially impossible to keep enough officers on the street. Two years after the overhaul, the department employed 411 officers with nearly the same budget. During a visit to the city last year, Obama praised the Camden County Police Department for it's drastic turnaround in its culture and its ability to build community relations. Obama called the department a “symbol of promise for the nation. ” Still, the city's   police force looks drastically different than the city that surrounds it: While 94 percent of the city's population is   white officers make up 68 percent of the Camden's officers.   police shootings in cities like Ferguson, Cleveland, and Falcon Heights, have highlighted communities around the nation that are fractured along racial lines, and have tense relationships with the police. Officer Cabria Davis, who was born and raised in Camden, has worked for the Camden County Police Department for two years. I spoke to Davis about her   assignment what it takes to build trust in a community processing police brutality as a black, female cop and why helping kids interact with police is good for everyone in the community. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Adrienne Green: What inspired you to become a police officer? Cabria Davis: I was born and raised in the city of Camden, New Jersey. When I was 9 years old, my father was murdered. He was shot and died. I really didn't have a close relationship with him. When that happened, it changed something in me as a person because I felt like I was robbed of that relationship. I wanted to make a positive difference [in the community] because even though I couldn't help my father, maybe I could grow up and help somebody else. Green: What is the community in Camden, New Jersey, like? What are some of the problems you're looking out for? Davis: Right now, the environment, demographic makeup, businesses, and residences are constantly changing. The government is trying to improve the quality of life of Camden with new schools to give the younger generation better opportunities. Businesses are also trying to create something positive in the city, allow the residents to have jobs, and give them a more positive atmosphere. Of course, as the police, we are trying to build a level of trust with the citizens here because our particular style of policing is more  . We try to let them know that our presence is constant: We're trying to learn, understand them and what they require from us. At the end of the day, we work for them. Green: How do you establish that trust? Davis: We have   barbecues for the kids. Officers go to these barbecues and play games we also cook for the kids. The kids get a chance to see us as regular people, and we let them know that we're their friends. Then, of course, we have the community meetings where our   talks to community leaders about the issues that they are having. They also just implemented the school patrol, which is when the department assigns an officer to patrol the schools. I am assigned to the five schools in North Camden, and I patrol them between the hours of 8 a. m. and 4 p. m. I talk to the teachers, principals, and students. That helps us establish another level of trust and communication with them because if the schools have a concern —  be it with a student, a parent, or things like traffic —  they have us right there. I take 15 to 20 minutes each hour per school, and I'll just rotate. I try to do at least four to five patrols of each school per school day. One principal asked if I could patrol between the hours of 11 and 1 because that's his primary lunch period and there were a lot of   students. I try my best to accommodate the needs of each principal, teacher, or school. Green: What is an average day like as a patrol officer at five schools? Davis: Before I patrolled schools, I was assigned to the   team, which is proactive policing. We did walking patrols in order to adjust crime conditions, drugs, and assaults. The special assignment for patrolling the schools is a safety initiative that was started by our district lieutenant. The most important aspect is the children. If you build a relationship with them, they get used to seeing you, you become a constant and consistent factor in their life. Then they'll say, ”Oh, this officer is friendly. This officer comes to see me at school every day.” It may help to combat [negative feelings] if they had a friend or family member that had a negative experience with the police —  because that colors their judgment as children because they learn based on what they see, and they absorb all of that. I've had children ask me, “Do you lock up kids? My uncle was locked up,” and it makes them sad because they don't understand. But then, if they see you and you say hi to them, you tell them your name, shake their hand, give them stickers —  it creates that trust with them. I've had instances where a parent will tell a child not to speak to me because I'm a police officer. That's not a good thing because as police officers, if your child is lost or in danger or something has happened, they should want to come to us. If you're telling them, as their parent, not to come to us, that is something that we have to fix. Maybe that parent had a negative relationship with the police, so now they're passing that on to their child and their child has to grow up with that mentality. Davis: If I was conducting my proactive patrols on the street level and I observed a fight, as an officer I would have to intervene so that no one gets hurt. But in the schools, it's not so much my job to enforce if I see two students fighting. I'm just there as a supplement to the principal or to the teacher, I'm not going to physically intervene because that is overstepping a boundary. At the end of the day, that principal, teacher, or parent is responsible for that student. They don't want to feel like police is singling out their children. Green: You've worked for the Camden County Police Department for two years. Have you seen the   trust that you're trying to build improve? Davis: It ebbs and flows. There are periods where it is very positive. Citizens get used to seeing us on the street, and they appreciate the increased police presence. They appreciate us walking our beats, patrolling the stores, playing basketball with the kids, and getting to know the people in the community. Then, with everything that's going on in the media, it changes the dynamic of that relationship. There are questions like, “Okay, I've known this officer for X amount of months, but here is this [instance of police violence] in the media. ” Now it's gotten to the point where we approach people, and they are like, ”What you want? I didn't do anything wrong. ” We're just trying to continue to build that level of trust, because we know what the media shows and we're just trying to show people that not every situation is that way. There are negative and positive engagements, just like with every other aspect of working or personal relationships. We had that level of trust, and now we have to work to rebuild it. Green: It appears that 94 percent of Camden's residents are   but 68 percent of the police force is made up of white officers. Amid the tense relationships between police and communities of color, has your ability to build trust been hampered? Davis: Even though Camden is predominately   and our police force is 68 percent Caucasian —  I don't think race affects how we police. Of course, the [minority] citizens feel like those [white] officers don't understand their personal views about the city, and they would be more comfortable speaking to someone like me. Residents may have these negative viewpoints, but once they talk to an officer they realize, ”Oh, just because he is not from my city, just because he does not look like me, doesn't mean that he doesn't care.” It doesn't matter if it's an African American officer or a Caucasian officer most of the time what people see is our uniform, so we have to learn how to get past that. Yes, I wear this uniform. Yes, I wear this badge however, behind all of this I am still somebody's daughter, somebody's spouse. I'm still a human. I still have feelings. It doesn't matter what a person's race is. My job as an officer is to be here for you. Green: I understand that you are a black, female police officer. How do you balance those personal and professional identities? Davis: It's a    basis. I had an incident where one of my fellow officers, who is Caucasian, had a negative engagement, and a gentleman that he spoke to felt uncomfortable. The civilian felt like he was being harassed because of the color of his skin. I said, ”Listen sir, [the other officer's] engagement with you has nothing to do with [his] race. I could just as easily have engaged you if I've never seen you before, but you would take a different attitude toward [the other officer] because of his race. ” Our job is to know who is in our community. That's what we do. I understand because I'm from this city, and that helps. Some people are more comfortable speaking to me because they're like, ”You understand because you're black or you're a woman.” I get that. That trust in me [as a black woman] helps to build trust between not only me and that person, but also that person and other officers whether they're Caucasian, Hispanic, or Asian. If I can act as a positive tether between those two people, then at the end of the day, that's what counts. Green: When you look at policing in communities nationwide, do you still feel that race should be as irrelevant as you see it being in Camden? Davis: It depends on the community, because different communities have their own way of policing. It doesn't necessarily mean it's racially based or racially motivated. People view the world through their own feelings, thoughts, and actions. It might not necessarily be what the case is, but you can only base your viewpoints on what you've experienced. The engagement of an encounter might not be   but because of your personal experience, that's how you view it and that's not always the case. Green: Do the parts of your identity —  as a black woman and as a trained police officer —  weigh differently into your interpretation of these types of events? Davis: As an officer, you don't know what another officer sees or feels at a particular moment, so we have no right to judge that person. But at the end of the day, if all of a person's engagements with police have been negative, naturally they're going to be a little afraid to interact with the police because they don't know what's going to happen. I can't verbalize my opinion because, at the end of the day, as an officer, I have to be completely unbiased. As a human, my first reaction was to get angry and upset about certain things. But being an officer forces you to take a step back and look at everything from all sides. For example, in a domestic dispute, if you have two people fighting and two different sides of the argument, you have to listen to all sides and then use objectivity to determine how you handle the situation. You can't allow your personal bias or personal experience color your judgment as an officer, because then you're not effective. If you go over there and the first thing you want to do is lock somebody up, you're not helping him or her. You're just creating a bigger issue. Green: What's the most rewarding and the most challenging part of your job? Davis: The most rewarding, of course, is the kids. If you're having a bad day as an officer, you just left a domestic dispute, and then a kid hugs you or draws you a picture or makes a little snowflake, it makes you feel good. I keep them in my bag. I had a little girl give me a book. She'll always see me and ask, “Do you still have the book I gave you?” I keep it in my bag so she knows how much I treasure that book. It doesn't matter if it was a $2 book. It's just the fact that she felt comfortable enough with me to want to do this positive thing for me. You're trying to give this child, who has to grow up and become their own person, positive energy. You have the power as an authority figure to, in a way, change their life. I had another situation where an older man, who was involved in drugs, almost died. I was able to get help to him, and he told me a few months later that he actually remembered me. He said, “I'm in school now. I don't use drugs anymore. I go to church and I work out. ” Whenever he sees me, he always wants to shake my hand because he feels like I saved him. To have that positive impact on somebody's life makes this career rewarding, but then of course, you have the situations where you have to lock up a parent and their children are there, and it breaks your heart. It's like, ”I don't want to see this kid cry. I don't want to hurt this kid, but I have to get this negative person away from them.” It hurts you because just like I don't want to be a bad person. I don't want to be seen as a bad person to this kid, but I have to do what I have to do to protect them. As a human, that type of stuff affects you on an emotional level because you see the type of emotional damage that humans do to other humans in fits of anger. It bothers me because I have to be objective, but at the same time, once I take that uniform off, I'm still a human underneath there. You still have to think about your whole day. You have to learn how to compartmentalize in a way so that it doesn't have a negative effect on your personality. If you're angry because someone hurt someone else, and you bring that home, you can create problems in your family life. At the same time, you can use that positive relationship that you have at home and bring that back to work and give a piece of that positive relationship to change someone's day for the better. Green: Has your job has influenced your identity? Davis: I've learned to use what I've learned through work —  ethical trainings and how to   conflict —  in my personal life. Before I became an officer, I was a very emotional person. The job has shown me to look at every situation from a different person's aspect, not just your own aspect. It forces you to take a step back and say, ”Okay, I'm not always right, so let me just take a step back and think about this other person's feelings. ” This interview is a part of an ongoing project on work and identity in America.

A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY.",False,"        , Camden, New Jersey, has long had a reputation as one of the most dangerous cities in America. In 2012, the city made an unprecedented move by terminating its entire   police force in favor of hiring   workers supervised by the county. Officials at that time said that union contracts, in a city with a major lack of revenue, made it financially impossible to keep enough officers on the street. Two years after the overhaul, the department employed 411 officers with nearly the same budget. During a visit to the city last year, Obama praised the Camden County Police Department for it's drastic turnaround in its culture and its ability to build community relations. Obama called the department a symbol of promise for the nation.  Still, the city's   police force looks drastically different than the city that surrounds it: While 94 percent of the city's population is   white officers make up 68 percent of the Camden's officers.   police shootings in cities like Ferguson, Cleveland, and Falcon Heights, have highlighted communities around the nation that are fractured along racial lines, and have tense relationships with the police. Officer Cabria Davis, who was born and raised in Camden, has worked for the Camden County Police Department for two years. I spoke to Davis about her   assignment what it takes to build trust in a community processing police brutality as a black, female cop and why helping kids interact with police is good for everyone in the community. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Adrienne Green: What inspired you to become a police officer? Cabria Davis: I was born and raised in the city of Camden, New Jersey. When I was 9 years old, my father was murdered. He was shot and died. I really didn't have a close relationship with him. When that happened, it changed something in me as a person because I felt like I was robbed of that relationship. I wanted to make a positive difference [in the community] because even though I couldn't help my father, maybe I could grow up and help somebody else. Green: What is the community in Camden, New Jersey, like? What are some of the problems you're looking out for? Davis: Right now, the environment, demographic makeup, businesses, and residences are constantly changing. The government is trying to improve the quality of life of Camden with new schools to give the younger generation better opportunities. Businesses are also trying to create something positive in the city, allow the residents to have jobs, and give them a more positive atmosphere. Of course, as the police, we are trying to build a level of trust with the citizens here because our particular style of policing is more  . We try to let them know that our presence is constant: We're trying to learn, understand them and what they require from us. At the end of the day, we work for them. Green: How do you establish that trust? Davis: We have   barbecues for the kids. Officers go to these barbecues and play games we also cook for the kids. The kids get a chance to see us as regular people, and we let them know that we're their friends. Then, of course, we have the community meetings where our   talks to community leaders about the issues that they are having. They also just implemented the school patrol, which is when the department assigns an officer to patrol the schools. I am assigned to the five schools in North Camden, and I patrol them between the hours of 8 a. m. and 4 p. m. I talk to the teachers, principals, and students. That helps us establish another level of trust and communication with them because if the schools have a concern   be it with a student, a parent, or things like traffic   they have us right there. I take 15 to 20 minutes each hour per school, and I'll just rotate. I try to do at least four to five patrols of each school per school day. One principal asked if I could patrol between the hours of 11 and 1 because that's his primary lunch period and there were a lot of   students. I try my best to accommodate the needs of each principal, teacher, or school. Green: What is an average day like as a patrol officer at five schools? Davis: Before I patrolled schools, I was assigned to the   team, which is proactive policing. We did walking patrols in order to adjust crime conditions, drugs, and assaults. The special assignment for patrolling the schools is a safety initiative that was started by our district lieutenant. The most important aspect is the children. If you build a relationship with them, they get used to seeing you, you become a constant and consistent factor in their life. Then they'll say, Oh, this officer is friendly. This officer comes to see me at school every day. It may help to combat [negative feelings] if they had a friend or family member that had a negative experience with the police   because that colors their judgment as children because they learn based on what they see, and they absorb all of that. I've had children ask me, Do you lock up kids? My uncle was locked up, and it makes them sad because they don't understand. But then, if they see you and you say hi to them, you tell them your name, shake their hand, give them stickers   it creates that trust with them. I've had instances where a parent will tell a child not to speak to me because I'm a police officer. That's not a good thing because as police officers, if your child is lost or in danger or something has happened, they should want to come to us. If you're telling them, as their parent, not to come to us, that is something that we have to fix. Maybe that parent had a negative relationship with the police, so now they're passing that on to their child and their child has to grow up with that mentality. Davis: If I was conducting my proactive patrols on the street level and I observed a fight, as an officer I would have to intervene so that no one gets hurt. But in the schools, it's not so much my job to enforce if I see two students fighting. I'm just there as a supplement to the principal or to the teacher, I'm not going to physically intervene because that is overstepping a boundary. At the end of the day, that principal, teacher, or parent is responsible for that student. They don't want to feel like police is singling out their children. Green: You've worked for the Camden County Police Department for two years. Have you seen the   trust that you're trying to build improve? Davis: It ebbs and flows. There are periods where it is very positive. Citizens get used to seeing us on the street, and they appreciate the increased police presence. They appreciate us walking our beats, patrolling the stores, playing basketball with the kids, and getting to know the people in the community. Then, with everything that's going on in the media, it changes the dynamic of that relationship. There are questions like, Okay, I've known this officer for X amount of months, but here is this [instance of police violence] in the media.  Now it's gotten to the point where we approach people, and they are like, What you want? I didn't do anything wrong.  We're just trying to continue to build that level of trust, because we know what the media shows and we're just trying to show people that not every situation is that way. There are negative and positive engagements, just like with every other aspect of working or personal relationships. We had that level of trust, and now we have to work to rebuild it. Green: It appears that 94 percent of Camden's residents are   but 68 percent of the police force is made up of white officers.

130,58426,80107,John Hinckley Nears Freedom,Atlantic,J. Weston Phippen,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , NEWS BRIEF John Hinckley was a mentally disturbed 25 year old in 1981 when he tried to assassinate President Reagan. A jury found Hinckley not guilty by reason of insanity, and ever since then he has lived in treatment at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D. C. But on September 10, he will take up new residence as a free man in Virginia in line with a judge's order last month. Hinckley's   lawyer, Barry Levine, announced the date Thursday, saying, “I think he will be a citizen about whom we can all be proud. ” Hinckley will move in with his mother, who has a home in Williamsburg. More than 30 years ago, Hinckley obsessed over Jodi Foster and her role in the 1976 film Taxi Driver, a story of a cab driver played by Robert De Niro who stalks a woman (played by Foster) and hopes to win her affection by killing a presidential candidate. Hinckley suffered from major depression and a psychotic disorder at the time, and he sought to emulate the movie's plot in real life. He stalked Foster at Yale University, where she was a student, and later followed President Jimmy Carter. When Reagan won the presidential election in 1980, Hinckley focused his obsession on him. On March 30, 1981, Hinckley shot Reagan in the chest and also wounded three others, including press secretary James Brady. Reagan eventually recovered. Here's a photo of the moment just after the shooting:   Reagan assassin John Hinckley Jr. adjusts to life in Virginia https:  .  via @CBS6 pic. twitter.  Hinckley has spent 34 years as a patient at St. Elizabeths Hospital. In the past decade, he has been given more freedom, traveling alone to visit his mother's home in Williamsburg. In that time, he's made more than 80 unsupervised trips out of the hospital, according to a court order released in July. In that order, U. S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman wrote that Hinckley, now 61, no longer poses a danger to himself or others, and for almost 30 years has shown “no signs of psychotic symptoms, delusional thinking, or any violent tendencies. ” The U. S. Secret Service has closely monitored Hinckley on many of his trips outside the hospital, usually while Hinckley makes visits to   Petsmart, or Subway, like in this photo taken last month when Hinckley stopped for a sandwich.

Brady, the press secretary injured in the shooting, spent much of his life fighting for stricter background checks for gun sales. He died in 2014, and police ruled his death a homicide. Reagan ultimately forgave Hinckley. But when his release was announced in July, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute said, “Contrary to the judge's decision, we believe John Hinckley is still a threat to others, and we strongly oppose his release. ” Hinckley's lawyer, Levine, has said Hinckley's actions all those years ago do not reflect the motives of an inherently evil man.

131,58427,80108,"Trump's Media Saturation, Quantified",Atlantic,Adrienne LaFrance,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , Trump is everywhere. It sometimes seems, and has seemed this way for several months, that the Republican nominee is all anyone can talk about. Whether this is because the media is doing its duty or because news organizations are capitalizing on Trump's bombast for ratings and traffic is a matter of debate. But one thing is clear: Trump is getting outsized attention compared with his opponents. The Atlantic's daily media tracker, which tallies television mentions of the candidates, shows Trump dominating. As of March, journalism's obsession with Trump had totaled the equivalent of about $2 billion in free media, according to an analysis by mediaQuant, a company that uses advertising rates to assign a dollar amount to the amount of media coverage a candidate gets. Clinton had garnered about $746 million in free media at the time, The NY Times reported, while Bernie Sanders free media totaled about $321 million. (“Free media” doesn't necessarily help a candidate, though. Though Trump seems to embrace the “no publicity is bad publicity” mantra, his favorability ratings among voters are miserable.) In the course of reporting another story, I've come across another staggering way to quantify and compare coverage of the candidates. Drawing from more than 50 newspapers in Nexis's archives, I've been pulling all the coverage related to Trump, Clinton, and Sanders over a   period from July 2015 to August 2016. (I also pulled 13 months of coverage from Bill Clinton's run for president in 1991 and 1992.) What I found is one of the clearest illustrations of how the pace of journalism has changed in the past 25 years: Even as newsrooms are smaller than ever, they're producing far more journalism —  at least in the realm of presidential campaign coverage. And that's largely because of how technology has upended the journalism industry as it once operated. In the mobile internet age, the appetite for      news is insatiable. Between 1994 and 2014, the industry cut over 20, 000 jobs, representing a 39 percent decline, according to a Pew report earlier this year. And yet, among the newspapers I looked at, there were more than double the amount of articles written about Clinton over a   period in 2015 and 2016 than there were written about her husband over the same time period when he ran for president in 1992.  (The coverage from this year includes   stories produced by newspapers, whereas the coverage from 1992 only comes from print stories.) The 2016 Candidates Who Are Making Headlines, Before we go any further, there are plenty of caveats to assessing coverage this way. For one, just looking at quantity tells us nothing about quality so there's really no fair way to discern from numbers alone whether this trend is a good thing, journalistically. (Many journalists lament the pace of the news today, and understandably so, but as a news consumer I would never want to return to an era where you had to wait for the nightly news or the morning paper to find out what had happened in the past several hours.) Besides that, there are other factors —  like coverage of the Benghazi hearings last October —  that help explain why so much more was written about Hillary than Bill. There's also the simple matter of space: On the internet, where writers aren't restricted by inches, there's more room to expand with   articles, and incremental updates. And, finally, there's certainly some overlap among the articles I pulled —  even though Nexis does some automatic correcting for duplicates —  because many articles are about more than one candidate. All we know, from this   is that reporters from the same set of newspapers —  or, their consolidated successors, as is the case among some metro dailies —  published 7, 945 articles about Bill Clinton during his 1992 run 18, 640 articles about Clinton over a   period in 2015 and 2016 7, 841 articles about Bernie Sanders over that same period and a whopping 29, 019 stories about Trump. In the coming weeks, I'll have deeper analysis about what that coverage actually reveals. 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY.",False,"        , Trump is everywhere. It sometimes seems, and has seemed this way for several months, that the Republican nominee is all anyone can talk about. Whether this is because the media is doing its duty or because news organizations are capitalizing on Trump's bombast for ratings and traffic is a matter of debate. But one thing is clear: Trump is getting outsized attention compared with his opponents. The Atlantic's daily media tracker, which tallies television mentions of the candidates, shows Trump dominating. As of March, journalism's obsession with Trump had totaled the equivalent of about $2 billion in free media, according to an analysis by mediaQuant, a company that uses advertising rates to assign a dollar amount to the amount of media coverage a candidate gets. Clinton had garnered about $746 million in free media at the time, The NY Times reported, while Bernie Sanders free media totaled about $321 million. (Free media doesn't necessarily help a candidate, though. Though Trump seems to embrace the no publicity is bad publicity mantra, his favorability ratings among voters are miserable.) In the course of reporting another story, I've come across another staggering way to quantify and compare coverage of the candidates. Drawing from more than 50 newspapers in Nexis's archives, I've been pulling all the coverage related to Trump, Clinton, and Sanders over a   period from July 2015 to August 2016. (I also pulled 13 months of coverage from Bill Clinton's run for president in 1991 and 1992.) What I found is one of the clearest illustrations of how the pace of journalism has changed in the past 25 years: Even as newsrooms are smaller than ever, they're producing far more journalism   at least in the realm of presidential campaign coverage. And that's largely because of how technology has upended the journalism industry as it once operated. In the mobile internet age, the appetite for      news is insatiable. Between 1994 and 2014, the industry cut over 20, 000 jobs, representing a 39 percent decline, according to a Pew report earlier this year. And yet, among the newspapers I looked at, there were more than double the amount of articles written about Clinton over a   period in 2015 and 2016 than there were written about her husband over the same time period when he ran for president in 1992.  (The coverage from this year includes   stories produced by newspapers, whereas the coverage from 1992 only comes from print stories.) The 2016 Candidates Who Are Making Headlines, Before we go any further, there are plenty of caveats to assessing coverage this way. For one, just looking at quantity tells us nothing about quality so there's really no fair way to discern from numbers alone whether this trend is a good thing, journalistically. (Many journalists lament the pace of the news today, and understandably so, but as a news consumer I would never want to return to an era where you had to wait for the nightly news or the morning paper to find out what had happened in the past several hours.) Besides that, there are other factors   like coverage of the Benghazi hearings last October   that help explain why so much more was written about Hillary than Bill. There's also the simple matter of space: On the internet, where writers aren't restricted by inches, there's more room to expand with   articles, and incremental updates.

132,58428,80109,America's New Lesson in Tolerance,Atlantic,Garrett Epps,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , “We almost beat one guy to death to make him kiss the flag,” a patriot in Litchfield, Illinois, told a Chicago reporter in 1940. When that vigilante beat a dissenter in the street —  and when hundreds like him brutalized, terrorized, and even mutilated Jehovah's Witnesses around the country  —  they were acting, they believed, with the imprimatur of the law, the Constitution, and the Supreme Court, which had ruled that the Witnesses' religious objection to reciting the Pledge of Allegiance was invalid. God vs. the Federal Election Commission, The Court and the nation learned a lesson from that episode. Lessons in tolerance, however, must be learned anew generation by generation. Not long ago, the public worked itself into an uproar when Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas, respectfully standing for the anthem in Rio, simply did not place her hands the way some people thought she should. But that was mere prologue to the outcry over San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who refused even to stand for the anthem before a game at Levi's Stadium, and who, unlike Douglas, did so in protest. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” he said afterwards, citing recent incidents including   protests and police shootings of   civilians.  The patriotic denunciations of Kaepernick are available on virtually any website and inescapable on any   station. He has been vilified (and supported) by fellow athletes and by groups of veterans. The San Francisco police union weighed in. No matter what their position, people all over the nation seem deeply anxious about whether this one highly paid athlete will behave in the manner expected of him. And many will be watching Thursday night at the   game to see whether he has learned his lesson. Flags and anthems and patriotic display can inspire love and heroism but they can also bring out the worst in people. Add war, social unease, sports, and race and the fists are likely to fly. This was the context of one of the Court's most humiliating mistakes —  one that led directly to violence in the streets, required the Court to eat its own words, and may teach us a lesson in tolerance today. Let's be clear what is at stake. Kaepernick has not expressed allegiance to or support for the nation's enemies. He has not made any criticism or attack on America's military. He has not refused to do his job as quarterback. He has not asked anyone to take down a flag, or sought to veto the playing of “The   Banner. ” He has not asserted a right to discriminate against anyone who does want to stand and salute during the National Anthem. Kaepernick has simply indicated that, for reasons he is willing to explain, he himself will not pay personal homage to our nation's symbol. Others may think he shouldn't feel that way, but he does, and he will not pretend to feel what he does not. That issue —  the compelled assertion of personal allegiance, a requirement by the state that individuals express feelings they did not hold —  brought the flag before the Court in 1940, and, after the decision, led directly to blood in the streets of American towns like Litchfield. Minersville School District v. Gobitis arose in 1935, when two Jehovah's Witnesses, Billy and Lillian Gobitas, refused to engage in a required flag salute and pledge of allegiance at their Pennsylvania elementary school. For Witnesses, pledging allegiance to any human symbol is a violation of the Second Commandment: “You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the waters under the earth.  You must not bow down to them nor be enticed to serve them   …     ” The local school board expelled them local people boycotted the family store. Lower federal courts supported their right to refuse the pledge. The case, however, reached the Supreme Court in 1940, as German armies were grinding toward Paris. The justices rejected the children's   claim to an exemption from the   requirement. (Poignantly enough, the Court could not even be bothered to spell the children's last name correctly.)  In the majority opinion, Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote that “We are dealing with an interest inferior to none in the hierarchy of legal values. National unity is the basis of national security. ” The legislature must have the freedom to promote that unity by requiring children to pledge allegiance, he wrote, and religious objections were no defense. As outlined in Shawn Francis Peters's Judging Jehovah's Witnesses: Religious Persecution and the Dawn of the Rights Revolution, the court's decision set off a wave of mob violence and persecution. (The quote from the Litchefield vigilante comes from the book.) Witness meeting houses were looted and burned. Citizens held public bonfires of Witness literature. Witnesses, tied together with ropes, were   out of towns in many states. Witnesses publicly soiled themselves after being   castor oil. A Nebraska mob castrated a Witness. Law enforcement did little. “They're traitors —  the Supreme Court says so,” one Texas sheriff told a northern journalist. By 1943, the court itself repented. The public outcry, the addition of a new justice, and three switched votes produced a new rule. Whatever “free exercise” of religion required, the new majority decided, the salute requirement violated the First Amendment's twin guarantee, free speech. In a famous passage, Justice Robert Jackson wrote that “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. ” Stripped of its color of law, persecution of the Witnesses slowly subsided. And the Court cleansed its escutcheon of a deep blot. Critics will be quick to point out that the court's misadventure is not directly on point in the Kaepernick. No one is forcing anyone to stand or exacting any legal punishment for those who do not. And Kaepernick, having made a political gesture, should expect criticism as well as discussion of his criticisms of American society. Nonetheless, the debate needs careful watching, remembering the context of Gobitis. That case arose as the world slid into war. The collapse of France, which happened while the opinion was being written, offered a terrifying spectacle —  the strongest military power in Europe undone in large part by its own internal disunity. Americans were worried about “fifth columnists” at home, and they mistook the Witnesses (persecuted in Axis and Allied countries alike) for Nazi sympathizers. The current controversy has already produced a public jersey burning. It would be too easy for the dispute to swell into boycotts and blacklists. How much of the national truculence about this minor football dispute arises from one stark fact —  that the current state of “authorized military force,” begun in the wake of September 11, is now by far the longest “war” the USA has fought —  nearly twice the length of the Revolution, nearly five times the length of World War II? For a decade and a half Americans have hated and feared an unseen, and indeed largely unnamed, enemy, one that has drawn blood inside the nation's borders and killed its young soldiers abroad. The country is nervous, and has reason to be. Stir into the brew another simmering American toxin. Since slavery times, dissent by black Americans has alarmed the white majority. Southern society kept a wary eye on black preachers —  a vigilance that found an echo in 2008, when many whites suspected that candidate Obama was tainted by exposure to a black minister named Jeremiah Wright. Wright's critical rhetoric, however, had deep roots, going back at least as far as Frederick Douglass, who in 1852 addressed a largely white Fourth of July celebration by saying, “The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought light and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth July is yours, not mine. ” Dissent by athletes in particular has often brought sharp rebuke American society has come to repent the punishments visited on Muhammad Ali for his draft refusal and on Tommie Smith and John Carlos for their public protest at the 1968 Olympics. But the urge to punish new dissenters is persistent it can link powerfully with hatred of foreigners. In an echo of the Gobitis era, one presidential candidate has proposed that this hatred take the form of law, whether of religious bans, “deportation forces,” or required indoctrination. Blood has already been shed at his rallies without a change in rhetoric, there will be more. The debate over Kaepernick's seated posture will be a welcome one if it begins with the recognition that symbolic issues are complex, that the conscience is a personal matter, and a society should be wary lest fear, xenophobia, religious intolerance, and racial animosity don patriot's garb. In a free country, no one has to kiss the flag.

133,58429,80110,Why Georgetown's Offer Falls Short,Atlantic,Adrienne Green,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , In 1838, the priests at the helm of Georgetown University sold 272 slaves who worked on Jesuit plantations in southern Maryland, the proceeds of which were used to pay off the university's debts. Now, nearly two centuries after they made that profit, university officials are trying to make amends to the families of those slaves. The university announced Thursday that in an effort to “respond to its historical ties to the institution of slavery,” the descendants of those 272 slaves will receive admission to the university in the same way it treats other legacy applicants whose parents or siblings are alumni. According to The NY Times, the policy will apply to descendants of all the slaves whose labor benefited Georgetown, not just those sold in 1838. The university did not respond immediately to a request for clarification. “The most appropriate ways for us to redress the participation of our predecessors in the institution of slavery is to address the manifestations of the legacy of slavery in our time,” said Georgetown President John J. DeGioia, who will offer a formal apology detail the university's plan at a press conference Thursday afternoon. How to Acknowledge a Shameful Past, While this treatment of student descendants of slaves in admissions is unprecedented, the announcement follows similar news from elite universities like Brown and Harvard, which have also made efforts to publicly reckon with the racism that is cemented in their pasts. From removing a slaveholder's mural from a dining hall to nixing the title of “housemaster,” each public atonement reveals the magnitude to which racism has always been entangled in America's most sacred institutions —  oftentimes, and in this case, as an explicit source of profit. Last September —  amid a series of protests on college campuses nationwide about racism and lack of inclusion —  DeGioia convened a group at Georgetown composed of faculty, students, and alumni, including some of the descendants of those slaves, to make recommendations on how to acknowledge the slavery connection. Some of their recommendations included: renaming two halls, a formal apology, creating an institute to study slavery, and developing a public memorial to the enslaved. Their recommendations, however, didn't extend beyond the adjusted admissions policy they didn't recommend that those accepted be compensated financially through scholarships. The original sale of the 272 slaves was an example of the institution and America's storied history with racism. But it was also a financial transaction whose benefactor was clear. Addressing the current manifestations of Georgetown's participation in slavery through an admissions policy begets their acknowledgment of their social failure. But Georgetown's cost of attendance totals nearly $70, 000 —  how will it ensure that these students can actually take advantage of the new offer?  Minority families already possess less wealth overall than white families, and minorities and poor students already shoulder the most student debt. There is no real reconciliation in lumping black families into the same broad policy as families that have been sending their kids to Georgetown for generations regardless. It is still unclear what kind of programs and funding will be set aside for these students once admitted. The policy will undoubtedly help some students gain access to an elite education. But in failing to ensure that the accepted students actually thrive once they get there, it serves as another example of universities falling short of their commitment to educate students of all backgrounds.

134,58430,80111,What Was So Shocking About Trump's Immigration Speech?,Atlantic,David Frum,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , “Anyone who has entered the USA illegally is subject to deportation —  that is what it means to have laws and to have a country. ” That line from Trump's immigration speech in Phoenix was tweeted out, highlighted in yellow marker, by Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Clinton, with the shocked header: “Explicit line on deportation from Trump's speech. ” If nothing else, Trump's speech succeeded in forcing into full public view the underlying attitudes that have shaped not only the Clinton campaign's immigration policy but the media coverage of the whole issue. In her speech in Reno, Nevada, Clinton quoted a saying: “Tell me with whom you walk, and I will tell you who you are. ” A professional politician, of all people, should appreciate the untruth of those words: It's almost a job qualification to “walk with” people with whom you disagree in important ways. (I'm looking right now at a photo of President Clinton walking with Yasser Arafat, for example.) But the words could accurately be updated : “Tell me what shocks you, and I'll tell you who you are. ” So let's review the Trump speech and pull out the lines that are supposed to be so shocking —  and wonder together how immigration became the topic area where it is most offensive to tell manifest truths. “Not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. ” Whether we are measuring by economic success, criminal offenses, national security threats, or contributions to the arts and sciences —  not all immigrants are equal. Not all immigration sources are equal either.   percent of immigrants from India arrive with a college degree or higher, as compared to only 13 percent of immigrants from Latin America. These effects persist over two and three generations. Refugees from the communist crackdown in Hungary in 1956 have flourished in America. More than a quarter century after they began to arrive in America, Somali refugees have not.   Japanese immigrants committed crimes at rates much lower than that of other Americans Mexican immigrants have historically offended at elevated rates. Why is any of this surprising? Nobody who valued the protections of a welfare state would voluntarily migrate from France to the USA —  but a person with a   idea very well might. The opposite would be true from a country like Brazil. “Most illegal immigrants are   workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they will ever pay in. ”   workers in the USA receive much more in benefits and transfers than they pay in taxes, especially if they live past age 65.   people will pay much more than they receive. That's how the system is designed in every advanced society. What it means, however, is that loose talk about needing immigrants to solve the problems of, for example, Medicare is like the old joke about losing money on every sale but trying to make it up on volume. Many of these redistributive programs are available to illegal immigrants too, especially the programs financed by state taxes. Illegal immigrants send their children to public schools. They use public clinics, roads, and prisons. They are eligible for   tax credits —  and often receive the Earned Income Tax Credit. These are all exhaustively documented facts. Plans to put millions of illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship —  and thus Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Section 8 housing, and so on —  will cost billions more. Those costs don't go away because proponents think it is somehow bad form to mention them. “The central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants —  or however many there may be. That has never been the central issue. It will never be the central issue. ” Here are some issues not discussed in Clinton's immigration plan: How many immigrants should the USA take? Who should they be? What should be expected of them? How do we know whether U. S. immigration policy is succeeding or failing? Literally every point in her most public statement of her immigration views deals with the interests of immigrants themselves, and especially of illegal immigrants. Nobody would do banking policy that way, or any other area of public concern. But to test immigration policy against the interests first and foremost of Americans themselves? Well again: Tell me what you find shocking, and I'll tell you who you are.

(I'm looking right now at a photo of President Clinton walking with Yasser Arafat, for example.) But the words could accurately be updated : Tell me what shocks you, and I'll tell you who you are.  So let's review the Trump speech and pull out the lines that are supposed to be so shocking   and wonder together how immigration became the topic area where it is most offensive to tell manifest truths. Not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate.  Whether we are measuring by economic success, criminal offenses, national security threats, or contributions to the arts and sciences   not all immigrants are equal. Not all immigration sources are equal either.   percent of immigrants from India arrive with a college degree or higher, as compared to only 13 percent of immigrants from Latin America. These effects persist over two and three generations. Refugees from the communist crackdown in Hungary in 1956 have flourished in America. More than a quarter century after they began to arrive in America, Somali refugees have not.   Japanese immigrants committed crimes at rates much lower than that of other Americans Mexican immigrants have historically offended at elevated rates. Why is any of this surprising? Nobody who valued the protections of a welfare state would voluntarily migrate from France to the USA   but a person with a   idea very well might. The opposite would be true from a country like Brazil. Most illegal immigrants are   workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they will ever pay in.    workers in the USA receive much more in benefits and transfers than they pay in taxes, especially if they live past age 65.   people will pay much more than they receive. That's how the system is designed in every advanced society. What it means, however, is that loose talk about needing immigrants to solve the problems of, for example, Medicare is like the old joke about losing money on every sale but trying to make it up on volume. Many of these redistributive programs are available to illegal immigrants too, especially the programs financed by state taxes. Illegal immigrants send their children to public schools. They use public clinics, roads, and prisons. They are eligible for   tax credits   and often receive the Earned Income Tax Credit. These are all exhaustively documented facts. Plans to put millions of illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship   and thus Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Section 8 housing, and so on   will cost billions more. Those costs don't go away because proponents think it is somehow bad form to mention them. The central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants   or however many there may be. That has never been the central issue. It will never be the central issue.  Here are some issues not discussed in Clinton's immigration plan: How many immigrants should the USA take? Who should they be? What should be expected of them? How do we know whether U. S. immigration policy is succeeding or failing? Literally every point in her most public statement of her immigration views deals with the interests of immigrants themselves, and especially of illegal immigrants. Nobody would do banking policy that way, or any other area of public concern. But to test immigration policy against the interests first and foremost of Americans themselves? Well again: Tell me what you find shocking, and I'll tell you who you are. 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY."
135,58431,80112,Which Republicans Oppose Trump? A Cheat Sheet,Atlantic,David A. Graham,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , Clinton leads Trump among several key demographic groups, but she has also locked up a surprisingly large portion of one small but notable niche: neoconservatives. In an interview with Der Spiegel published on Friday, Paul Wolfowitz, who served as deputy secretary of defense during George W. Bush's presidency, said he would likely vote for Clinton —  though he noted he had “big reservations” about her. Wolfowitz said he agreed with those who deemed the Republican nominee a security threat. “The only way you can be comfortable about Trump's foreign policy, is to think he doesn't really mean anything he says,” he said. “Our security depends on having good relationships with our allies. Trump mainly shows contempt for them. And he seems to be unconcerned about the Russian aggression in Ukraine. By doing this he tells them that they can go ahead and do what they are doing. That is dangerous. ” Wolfowitz is only the latest in his cohort to throw his support behind Clinton, or at the very least to declare public opposition to Trump. Neoconservative intellectuals and pundits like Bill Kristol, Max Boot, and Robert Kagan have also been particularly harsh in criticizing Trump. Richard Armitage, who is less associated with the group but served under Bush, has also announced he'll support Clinton. Meanwhile, former StateSecretary Condoleezza Rice and President Bush himself have remained pointedly silent, declining to back the Republican nominee. There are a few notable exceptions, and they are perhaps the two   neoconservatives: former Vice President Dick Cheney, and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Those two men were both in Republican politics before the rise of the neocons, and found that their belligerent style was well tailored to an alliance. They are also, as Jonathan Chait notes, among the Gentile members of a movement that originated with Jewish intellectuals. There are some straightforward reasons for the alliance with Clinton. Though they may disagree with her on many issues, particularly domestically, the neocons are focused more than anything on foreign policy. In that realm, Clinton represents a fairly standard, mainstream position, and in fact she has shown herself to be somewhat more hawkish than many Democrats, backing both the war in Iraq and intervention in Libya. Trump, on the other hand, has toppled pillar after pillar of policy orthodoxy, from his praise for Vladimir Putin to his dismissal of longstanding alliances. But the wave of neocon love also makes many of Clinton's Democratic supporters uncomfortable. As the chaotic and failed attempts to stop Trump over the last year have shown, there's no obviously right choice for how conservatives should respond. But which choice are people making? Here's a list of some major figures and where they stand on Trump —  right now. We'll keep it updated as other important people take stances, or as these ones change their views about Trump. George W. Bush: ABSTAINThe former president “does not plan to participate in or comment on the presidential campaign,” an aide told the Texas Tribune. (May 4, 2016) George H. W.

(May 9, 2016) Eric Cantor: YEACantor, the former U. S. representative from Virginia and House majority leader, says he will back Trump, though he offered a tepid endorsement, saying a   matchup was “probably not the best choice for anybody,” and adding, “He's a businessman . . .

Rick Santorum: YEAThe former Pennsylvania senator and   presidential candidate appeared, with Mike Huckabee, at a Trump rally back in January, when they were ostensibly rivals.

(May 25, 2016) Karl Rove: UNDECIDEDThe former George W. Bush strategist and current Wall Street Journal columnist and PAC boss has called Trump  “a complete idiot” who is “graceless and divisive. ” (Trump, in turn, has asked, “Is he not the dumbest human being on earth? ”) But The NY Times reports the two men met in May. (June 3, 2016) Larry Pressler: NAYA moderate and former   senator from South Dakota, Pressler has endorsed Clinton for president. (June 14, 2016) Herman Cain: YEAMr.    the 2012 Republicans presidential candidate, introduced Trump at a rally in Atlanta, calling him “one of the great conservative voices in America today. ” He had previously told Republicans who didn't back Trump to “get over it” but also insisted it was not an endorsement. (June 15, 2016) Norm Coleman: NAYThe former Minnesota senator wrote in a March 3 column that he will not support the Republican nominee. “I won't vote for Trump because of who he isn't. He isn't a Republican. He isn't a conservative. He isn't a truth teller  …    . I also won't vote for Trump because of who he is. A bigot. A misogynist. A fraud. A bully. ” (July 7, 2016) Michael Bloomberg: NAYDoes the former NY mayor count as a Republican? A former Democrat, he ran and was elected Big Apple head honcho as a Republican, though he later became an independent. In any case, Bloomberg is appalled by Trump, and he will speak on behalf of Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. (June 24, 2016) Sally Bradshaw: NAYBradshaw, a longtime operative and aid to Jeb Bush, was an author of the Republicans's   “autopsy” report. Now she says she's not even a member of the party. “Ultimately, I could not abide the hateful rhetoric of Trump and his complete lack of principles and conservative philosophy.

Bush: YEAThe scion of the Bush family, who is currently Texas land commissioner, has broken with other members of the Bush clan, who have either pointedly abstained or said they would not vote for Trump. “From Team Bush, it's a bitter pill to swallow, but you know what? You get back up and you help the man that won, and you make sure that we stop Clinton,” he said. (August 6, 2016) Chris Shays: NAYA longtime moderate Republican U. S. representative from Connecticut who lost his seat in 2008, Shays has endorsed Clinton. “I think many Republicans know Trump could cause great damage to our country and the world at large, and still plan to vote for him.

I hope to, and I want to. ” He said the party needs “a   that bears our standards. ” (May 5, 2016) Kevin McCarthy: YEAThe House majority leader, a Californian, has broken with Speaker Paul Ryan and will back Trump.

I would like to ask him questions about some of the statements he's made,” she told The  . (May 5, 2016) Raul Labrador: YEAThe Idaho congressman, a Tea Party hero, tepidly backs Trump after opposing him in the primary and backing Cruz. “There are some things he doesn't quite understand,” Labrador told The Huffington Post. “With Trump, I have at least some hope that he's going to make the right choice. ” Ileana  : NAYThe senior member of the Florida congressional delegation says she will write Jeb Bush's name in on the ballot in November.

While I disagree with her on many issues, I will vote for Mrs. Clinton. ” (August 2, 2016) Charlie Dent: NAYDent, a moderate Republican who represents southeastern Pennsylvania, said he doesn't intend to vote for Trump or Clinton. “I'm not planning to vote for either of the two   nominees and I'm not ready to say I'm going to vote for the libertarians either,” he told Jake Tapper. (August 2, 2016) Adam Kinzinger: NAYThe Illinois representative, a former Air Force pilot hails from a district west and south of Chicago, criticized Ted Cruz when he didn't endorse Trump at the RNC. But then after Trump suggested not supporting NATO allies, Kinzinger described the idea as “utterly disastrous,” and he now tells CNN, “I don't see how I can get there anymore. ” (August 3, 2016) Mike Coffman: UNDECIDEDIn a new television ad, the Colorado representative says, “People ask me, 'What do you think about Trump?'

A spokeswoman says he is considering other candidates, but he has not ruled out voting for the nominee. (August 4, 2016) Bob Dold: NAYThe Illinois congressman, who represents the northern suburbs of Chicago, was among the first Republicans to say he would not vote for Trump. “Whether it be Mr. Trump's comments about women, his comments about Muslims, his comments about Latinos, for me it was very personal his comments about POWs,” Dold told WLS in May, adding, “I want to make that I'm clear about this, I'm not going to support Clinton either.  I would write someone in. ” (May 6, 2016) Scott Rigell: NAYThe Virginia congressman, who represents the Virginia Beach area, has become the first Republican member of Congress to say that he will vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson. Rigell says he long ago decided he could not back Trump. “When their own conscience is seared by some statement that Trump has made, I have encouraged them to be direct and also, in a timely manner, repudiate what he said,” he told The NY Times. (August 7, 2016) Dave Reichert: UNDECIDEDThe Washington congressman, who represents a district just east of Seattle, said in an interview with KIRO radio that he would “never” endorse Trump. But he also said he wouldn't vote for Clinton, and when pressed on whether he would vote for Trump, he added, “I never said I wouldn't vote for him, I just said I wouldn't endorse him. ” (August 11, 2016) Mark Sanford: YEAThe South Carolina conservative and former governor (as you may recall) is backing Trump —  he writes in a NY Times   calling on the nominee to release his tax returns. “I am a conservative Republican who, though I have no stomach for his personal style and his penchant for regularly demeaning others, intends to support my party's nominee because of the importance of filling the existing vacancy on the Supreme Court, and others that might open in the next four years. ” (August 16, 2016) Reid Ribble: NAYThe Wisconsin congressman has consistently been an outspoken Trump critic. He said in December that he would not back Trump if he became the nominee. In June, he said Trump was “likely to be a racist. ” Now, along with Representative Scott Rigell and a slew of operatives, he has signed a letter asking the RNC to withdraw resources from the Trump campaign and concentrate on holding Congress. (August 16, 2016) Mitch McConnell: YEAThe Senate majority leader issued a statement tepidly backing Trump. “I have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters, and Trump, the presumptive nominee is now on the verge of clinching that nomination,” he said. (May 4, 2016) Ted Cruz: APPARENT NAY (was UNDECIDED) The Texas senator made his opinion about Trump fairly clear when he was given a prized speaking slot at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Cruz refused to endorse the nominee, offering some barbed,   comments like this: “Don't stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution. ” He was booed off the stage. Trump then said he'd refuse to accept Cruz's endorsement if offered, which doesn't seem likely to be an issue. Cruz had previously floated the idea —  likely unrealistic —  of reanimating his suspending campaign and refused to endorse Trump. “We'll see what happens as the months go forward, I think we need to watch and see what the candidates say and do,” he told Glenn Beck. (May 10, 2016) In dropping out of the Republican race after losing to Trump, Cruz did not make any indication whether he was willing to back his rival. (May 3, 2016) Jeff Sessions: YEAThe Alabama senator was Trump's first endorser from the Senate, and he has been a   backer and adviser to Trump's campaign. Susan Collins: NAY (was UNDECIDED) The moderate Maine senator writes in a Washington Post column that she has decided she cannot vote for Trump. “I have become increasingly dismayed by his constant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize,” she writes. “But it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing —  either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level —  that revealed Mr. Trump as unworthy of being our president. ” She has not said for whom she will vote. (August 9, 2016) Collins previously told Time that she was in    mode. “I've said from the point that it became obvious that Trump was going to be the Republican candidate that I'd always supported previous presidential nominees of my party but that in this case I was going to wait and see what happened and that is what I am continuing to do. ” (June 7, 2016) Having previously said that her backing from Trump would be contingent upon a shift in his rhetoric, Collins then said she would support the nominee. (May 6, 2016) Collins said: “I have always supported the Republican nominee for president, and I suspect I would do so this year, but I do want see what Trump does from here on out. ” To win her vote, “He's going to have stop with gratuitous personal insults,” she said, amusingly. (May 4, 2016) John McCain: YEAThe Arizona senator and 2008 Republicans presidential nominee, who is in a tight reelection battle, released a scorching statement criticizing Trump for his comments about Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, but he did not revoke his support. (August 1, 2016) McCain has said publicly that he'll back the nominee. In a private recording obtained by Politico, however, he frets that Trump endangers his reelection effort, while his former top aide Mark Salter is backing Clinton. (May 5, 2016) Kelly Ayotte: YEALike her friend John McCain, the New Hampshire senator attacked Trump for his feud with Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, pronouncing herself “appalled” but giving no indication that she will withdraw backing for Trump. (August 1, 2016) Ayotte, who is also in a tight reelection battle, previously said she plans to “support” but not “endorse” Trump, whatever that means. (May 5, 2016) Rand Paul: YEAIn a fascinating interview with WDRB (via Reason) the Kentucky senator and former presidential candidate said citizens should vote their conscience, while suggesting that he was only publicly backing Trump because he had pledged during the primary to support the nominee. “I've made my complaints about our nominee quite explicit. I continue to do so, but also don't see it as my job now —  the thing is, is: I do think that my word is important. I signed a document, not under duress, but I signed a document saying I wouldn't run as a third party and I will support the nominee. ” (August 2, 2016) Paul has said he will support Trump. (His father,   and presidential contender Ron Paul, says he will not.) (May 4, 2016) Lindsey Graham: NAYThe South Carolina senator and former presidential candidate blasted Trump following the nominee's attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, saying fellow Republicans should withdraw their endorsements. “This is the most   thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,” he said. “If anybody was looking for an   this is probably it. There'll come a time when the love of country will trump hatred of Hillary. ” (June 7, 2016) Graham was one of Trump's most prominent critics during the primary, even endorsing Cruz even though he'd previously likened the choice between him and Trump to a choice between poisoning and being shot. The day Trump won Indiana, Graham tweeted: If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed. .... ..and we will deserve it. Graham says he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton. (May 6, 2016) Ben Sasse: NAYThe Nebraska freshman senator was another   ringleader, and has been suggested as a   candidate. In a long Facebook post, he explained why he's still not backing Trump. (May 4, 2016) Marco Rubio: SOFT YEAThe Florida senator and former presidential candidate said he does not plan to attend the Republican National Convention, but he has not made any statement changing his stance on Trump. (July 6, 2016) In an interview with The Weekly Standard, Rubio said that although he has backed Trump, who he views as preferable to Clinton, he still believes what he said during the presidential campaign: That Trump is unfit for the presidency and cannot be trusted with the nation's nuclear arsenal. (June 9, 2016) Rubio, who previously referred to Trump as a “con artist,” now says he backs Trump, will attend the Republican National Convention, and will release his remaining delegates to Trump. “I want to be helpful. I don't want to be harmful, because I don't want Clinton to be president,” he told Jake Tapper. (May 26, 2016) Rubio had previously not spoken about the race since Trump became the presumptive nominee, but in late April he said that he'd support Trump in order to beat Clinton. (April 21, 2016) Rob Portman: YEAThe Ohio senator, who's locked in a tough reelection fight, has previously said he'd back the Republican nominee. Most recently, he said that having Trump on the ticket would be positive for his own hopes. (May 5, 2016) Richard Burr: YEAThe North Carolinian, who also faces a tough reelection, supports Trump. (May 4, 2016)  : I look forward to working with Mr. Trump at the top of the ticket and to maintaining a #Republicans Senate. Roy Blunt: YEAThe Missourian, who is up for reelection, says he will support the nominee. (May, 5, 2016) Ron Johnson: YEAThe Wisconsin senator, who is battling predecessor Russ Feingold, is one of the most precarious Republicans this year. He tepidly backed Trump. “As Ron has repeatedly said for months, he intends to support the Republican nominee, but he's focused on the concerns of Wisconsinites —  not national political winds,” a spokesman told Roll Call. (May 5, 2016) Pat Toomey: UNDECIDEDThe Pennsylvania senator, another endangered incumbent, has not made up his mind. “As I have said repeatedly, I have not endorsed Trump,” he said at a press conference. “There are things that he has said, a number of things he has said and done that give me great pause and I have significant concerns about, so I remain in a mode of waiting to be persuaded. I've not made a final decision on what I'm going to do. Clinton is completely unacceptable to me. ” (August 10, 2016) Toomey previously said: “It certainly looks like Trump is on his way to the nomination .  …     Trump was not my first choice. He wasn't my second choice or third or fourth choice. I have lots have differences with Trump and lots of problems with him but I am absolutely in the ‘never Clinton' camp. ” (May 4, 2016) Mark Kirk: NAY (was YEA) The Illinois senator, one of this year's most endangered incumbents, says he will write in Colin Powell for president. (August 11, 2016) Kirk previously announced that he is no longer supporting Trump —  the first Republican to rescind his backing. “After much consideration, I have concluded that Trump has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to assume the greatest office in the world,” he said.  (June 7, 2016) Kirk previously said he'd back Trump if nominated.

(June 30, 2016) Lee previously expressed reservations. “I have not supported Trump up to this point, I have not endorsed him,” Lee said, according to the Washington Examiner. ”I have some concerns with him.

(June 21, 2016) 	A bartender's camera captures the seedy street life of retro NY.",False,"        , Clinton leads Trump among several key demographic groups, but she has also locked up a surprisingly large portion of one small but notable niche: neoconservatives. In an interview with Der Spiegel published on Friday, Paul Wolfowitz, who served as deputy secretary of defense during George W. Bush's presidency, said he would likely vote for Clinton   though he noted he had big reservations about her. Wolfowitz said he agreed with those who deemed the Republican nominee a security threat. The only way you can be comfortable about Trump's foreign policy, is to think he doesn't really mean anything he says, he said. Our security depends on having good relationships with our allies. Trump mainly shows contempt for them. And he seems to be unconcerned about the Russian aggression in Ukraine. By doing this he tells them that they can go ahead and do what they are doing. That is dangerous.  Wolfowitz is only the latest in his cohort to throw his support behind Clinton, or at the very least to declare public opposition to Trump. Neoconservative intellectuals and pundits like Bill Kristol, Max Boot, and Robert Kagan have also been particularly harsh in criticizing Trump. Richard Armitage, who is less associated with the group but served under Bush, has also announced he'll support Clinton. Meanwhile, former StateSecretary Condoleezza Rice and President Bush himself have remained pointedly silent, declining to back the Republican nominee. There are a few notable exceptions, and they are perhaps the two   neoconservatives: former Vice President Dick Cheney, and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Those two men were both in Republican politics before the rise of the neocons, and found that their belligerent style was well tailored to an alliance. They are also, as Jonathan Chait notes, among the Gentile members of a movement that originated with Jewish intellectuals. There are some straightforward reasons for the alliance with Clinton. Though they may disagree with her on many issues, particularly domestically, the neocons are focused more than anything on foreign policy. In that realm, Clinton represents a fairly standard, mainstream position, and in fact she has shown herself to be somewhat more hawkish than many Democrats, backing both the war in Iraq and intervention in Libya. Trump, on the other hand, has toppled pillar after pillar of policy orthodoxy, from his praise for Vladimir Putin to his dismissal of longstanding alliances. But the wave of neocon love also makes many of Clinton's Democratic supporters uncomfortable. As the chaotic and failed attempts to stop Trump over the last year have shown, there's no obviously right choice for how conservatives should respond. But which choice are people making? Here's a list of some major figures and where they stand on Trump   right now. We'll keep it updated as other important people take stances, or as these ones change their views about Trump. George W. Bush: ABSTAINThe former president does not plan to participate in or comment on the presidential campaign, an aide told the Texas Tribune. (May 4, 2016) George H. W.

(May 4, 2016) Barbara Bush: NAYUnlike her husband and elder son, the former first lady has publicly disavowed Trump. I mean, unbelievable. I don't know how women can vote for someone who said what he said about Megyn Kelly, it's terrible, she told CBS in February. And we knew what he meant too.  (February 4, 2016) Mitt Romney: NAYThe party's 2012 nominee, one of Trump's staunchest critics during the primary, told The Wall Street Journal, I wanted my grandkids to see that I simply couldn't ignore what Mr. Trump was saying and doing, which revealed a character and temperament unfit for the leader of the free world.  Romney continued: I know that some people are offended that someone who lost and is the former nominee continues to speak, but that's how I can sleep at night.  (May 27, 2016) Romney previously told The Washington Post he would skip the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, and said at a D. C. dinner that he won't be supporting Trump. (May 5, 2016) Bob Dole: YEA (formerly UNDECIDED) The former Senate majority leader and 1996 Republicans presidential nominee endorsed Trump on May 6.

(May 4, 2016) Tom DeLay: UNDECIDEDAsked by reporter Jon Ward whether Clinton or Trump was worse, the former House majority leader responded, I can't answer that right now.  (June 21, 2016) DeLay hadn't spoken out since Trump's ascension, but was highly critical of him during the primary: We have got to stop Trump. Whatever it takes without cheating or violating the rules of the Republican primaries, he told Newsmax. Dick Cheney: YEAThe former vice president blasted Trump during the primary over his stance on   and said he sounds like a liberal Democrat, but he now says he will back the nominee. (May 6, 2016) Newt Gingrich: YEAThe former speaker of the House did not formally endorse Trump during the primary, but he has repeatedly praised the mogul and his vision, and is said to be a contender for a position in a Trump administration. Jeb Bush: NAYThe former Florida governor and presidential candidate came to detest Trump during the campaign. In April, he said he would not attend the Republican National Convention. He now says he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton. (May 6, 2016) Reince Priebus: YEAAs chair of the Republican National Committee, Priebus doesn't really have a choice, though that doesn't mean he won't pour Baileys in his cereal over it. (May 4, 2016) . @realDonaldTrump will be presumptive @Republicans nominee, we all need to unite and focus on defeating @HillaryClinton #NeverClinton, Priebus said on May 6 that Trump needs to change his tone. Rick Perry: YEAThe former Texas governor and presidential candidate   who was one of the first to blast Trump   told CNN that he backs Trump. (  ) Mike Huckabee: YEAThe former Arkansas governor, who ran for president this year, says Republicans should get in line.  When we nominated people over the past several election cycles, some of us had heartburn, but we stepped up and supported the nominee, he said. You're either on the team, or you're not on the team.  (May 5, 2016) Bobby Jindal: YEAThe former Louisiana governor, who during his own presidential campaign called Trump a narcissist and an egomaniacal madman, wrote in a Wall Street Journal column that he's voting for Trump, warts and all.  I think electing Trump would be the   thing we could do this November, better only than electing Clinton to serve as the third term for the Obama administration's radical policies, he said. (May 9, 2016) Eric Cantor: YEACantor, the former U. S. representative from Virginia and House majority leader, says he will back Trump, though he offered a tepid endorsement, saying a   matchup was probably not the best choice for anybody, and adding, He's a businessman . . . [but] he's been on so many sides of every issue that you never know.  (May 9, 2016) Ben Carson: YEACarson, a relative political newcomer who ran for president in 2016, has become one of Trump's most prominent surrogates, despite repeatedly voicing misgivings about the candidate. Rick Santorum: YEAThe former Pennsylvania senator and   presidential candidate appeared, with Mike Huckabee, at a Trump rally back in January, when they were ostensibly rivals. (Both Santorum and Huckabee already seemed finished by then.) Despite Santorum's strong social conservatism, he says that after a long    with Trump he is 100 percent endorsing the nominee. (May 25, 2016) Karl Rove: UNDECIDEDThe former George W. Bush strategist and current Wall Street Journal columnist and PAC boss has called Trump  a complete idiot who is graceless and divisive.  (Trump, in turn, has asked, Is he not the dumbest human being on earth? ) But The NY Times reports the two men met in May. (June 3, 2016) Larry Pressler: NAYA moderate and former   senator from South Dakota, Pressler has endorsed Clinton for president. (June 14, 2016) Herman Cain: YEAMr.    the 2012 Republicans presidential candidate, introduced Trump at a rally in Atlanta, calling him one of the great conservative voices in America today.  He had previously told Republicans who didn't back Trump to get over it but also insisted it was not an endorsement. (June 15, 2016) Norm Coleman: NAYThe former Minnesota senator wrote in a March 3 column that he will not support the Republican nominee. I won't vote for Trump because of who he isn't. He isn't a Republican. He isn't a conservative. He isn't a truth teller      . I also won't vote for Trump because of who he is. A bigot. A misogynist. A fraud. A bully.  (July 7, 2016) Michael Bloomberg: NAYDoes the former NY mayor count as a Republican? A former Democrat, he ran and was elected Big Apple head honcho as a Republican, though he later became an independent. In any case, Bloomberg is appalled by Trump, and he will speak on behalf of Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. (June 24, 2016) Sally Bradshaw: NAYBradshaw, a longtime operative and aid to Jeb Bush, was an author of the Republicans's   autopsy report. Now she says she's not even a member of the party. Ultimately, I could not abide the hateful rhetoric of Trump and his complete lack of principles and conservative philosophy. I didn't make this decision lightly, she told CNN. She said if Florida looks close, she will vote for Clinton in order to defeat Trump. (August 1, 2016) Marc Racicot: NAYRacicot, a confidant of former President George W. Bush who chaired the RNC from 2001 to 2003, tells Bloomberg, I cannot and will not support Trump for president.  (August 3, 2016) Vin Weber: NAYA former Minnesota congressman who helped Newt Gingrich bring the Republicans to power and is now a lobbyist, Weber has ruled out Trump. I won't vote for Trump, he told CNBC. I can't imagine I'd remain a Republican if he becomes president.  (August 3, 2016) Gordon Humphrey: NAYThe former U. S. senator from New Hampshire says he cannot vote for Trump, calling him a sociopath, without a conscience or feelings of guilt, shame or remorse.  Humphrey told NBC he may reluctantly vote for Clinton, but only if it's a close contest. (August 4, 2016) George P. Bush: YEAThe scion of the Bush family, who is currently Texas land commissioner, has broken with other members of the Bush clan, who have either pointedly abstained or said they would not vote for Trump. From Team Bush, it's a bitter pill to swallow, but you know what? You get back up and you help the man that won, and you make sure that we stop Clinton, he said. (August 6, 2016) Chris Shays: NAYA longtime moderate Republican U. S. representative from Connecticut who lost his seat in 2008, Shays has endorsed Clinton. I think many Republicans know Trump could cause great damage to our country and the world at large, and still plan to vote for him. But not me, Shays wrote for CNN. He said he backs Clinton not reluctantly but with strong conviction.  (August 10, 2016) Richard Viguerie: YEAThe   pioneer and   elder statesman was once a Trump critic, saying in February, I'm just very concerned about his mental stability and his moral background, or lack thereof, which he brags about. He has no grounds that drive him morally.  More recently, however, he has taken to praising Trump. I haven't seen anything like this since the 1980 Reagan campaign against  Carter, he said. (September 2, 2016) Paul Ryan: YEA (was UNDECIDED) The House speaker once again affirmed his backing for Trump, offering     statement, That's not my plan. I don't have a plan to do that.  (June 16, 2016) has condemned Trump's attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel's as absolutely unacceptable, saying, Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment, but adding that he isn't dropping his support for Trump. (June 7, 2016) Ryan previously announced that he will vote for Trump: I'll be voting for @realDonaldTrump this fall. I'm confident he will help turn the House Republicans's agenda into laws. https:  .  Ryan said he had become convinced that Trump would help Ryan enact his House agenda. (June 2, 2016) Ryan initially said he intended to support the Republican nominee, but after Trump clinched the nomination, he said he was not yet prepared to back Trump. To be perfectly candid with you, I'm just not ready to that at this point, he told CNN's Jake Tapper. I'm not there. I hope to, and I want to.  He said the party needs a   that bears our standards.  (May 5, 2016) Kevin McCarthy: YEAThe House majority leader, a Californian, has broken with Speaker Paul Ryan and will back Trump. McCarthy has signed up as a prospective delegate for Trump in the Golden State. (May 10, 2016) Steve Scalise: YEAThe House majority whip, a Louisiana representative, offered Trump a tepid endorsement. (The two men share the dubious distinction of being linked politically to David Duke.) I've always said that I will support the Republican nominee, Scalise said. Now is the time for for our party to unite around Trump so that we can focus on defeating Clinton in November to prevent another four years of   big government policies so we can get our economy back on track.  (May 5, 2016) Cathy McMorris Rodgers: YEA (formerly UNDECIDED) The Washington representative, who is chair of the House Republican Caucus, offered Trump a tepid endorsement, pointing out that he was the choice of primary voters, but adding, In the months ahead, he will have to earn the presidency by demonstrating that he has the temperament for the job and plans to empower every American to pursue a future of opportunity and freedom.  (May 19, 2016) McMorris Rodgers previously said she had not made up her mind. Before I endorse him, I would like to have a conversation with him. I would like to ask him questions about some of the statements he's made, she told The  . (May 5, 2016) Raul Labrador: YEAThe Idaho congressman, a Tea Party hero, tepidly backs Trump after opposing him in the primary and backing Cruz. There are some things he doesn't quite understand, Labrador told The Huffington Post. With Trump, I have at least some hope that he's going to make the right choice.  Ileana  : NAYThe senior member of the Florida congressional delegation says she will write Jeb Bush's name in on the ballot in November. (August 11, 2016)   who was born in Cuba and emigrated to the USA, has said she will not vote for Trump. I will work with whomever is chosen by the American people to serve as president, because I deeply respect the American constitutional system, she said in a statement. In this election, I do not support either Trump or Clinton.  (May 6, 2016) Fred Upton: ABSTAINThe longtime Michigan congressman (and, true fact, uncle of Kate) says he will not endorse Trump, though he stopped short of saying he would not vote for him.  There's a lot of things that folks are not happy about with either of these two candidates, he said during a radio interview. We're running our own race, and don't look for me to endorse anyone in this race probably the rest of the year.  (June 16, 2016) Richard Hanna: NAYHanna, a retiring congressman who represents a swing district in central NY, is the first House Republican to say he will vote for Clinton. For me, it is not enough to simply denounce [Trump's] comments: He is unfit to serve our party and cannot lead this country, Hanna wrote in the Syracuse  . Secretary Clinton has issues that depending on where one stands can be viewed as great or small      . While I disagree with her on many issues, I will vote for Mrs. Clinton.  (August 2, 2016) Charlie Dent: NAYDent, a moderate Republican who represents southeastern Pennsylvania, said he doesn't intend to vote for Trump or Clinton. I'm not planning to vote for either of the two   nominees and I'm not ready to say I'm going to vote for the libertarians either, he told Jake Tapper. (August 2, 2016) Adam Kinzinger: NAYThe Illinois representative, a former Air Force pilot hails from a district west and south of Chicago, criticized Ted Cruz when he didn't endorse Trump at the RNC. But then after Trump suggested not supporting NATO allies, Kinzinger described the idea as utterly disastrous, and he now tells CNN, I don't see how I can get there anymore.  (August 3, 2016) Mike Coffman: UNDECIDEDIn a new television ad, the Colorado representative says, People ask me, 'What do you think about Trump?' Honestly, I don't care for him much. And I certainly don't trust Hillary. He promises to stand up to Trump. A spokeswoman says he is considering other candidates, but he has not ruled out voting for the nominee. (August 4, 2016) Bob Dold: NAYThe Illinois congressman, who represents the northern suburbs of Chicago, was among the first Republicans to say he would not vote for Trump. Whether it be Mr. Trump's comments about women, his comments about Muslims, his comments about Latinos, for me it was very personal his comments about POWs, Dold told WLS in May, adding, I want to make that I'm clear about this, I'm not going to support Clinton either.  I would write someone in.  (May 6, 2016) Scott Rigell: NAYThe Virginia congressman, who represents the Virginia Beach area, has become the first Republican member of Congress to say that he will vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson. Rigell says he long ago decided he could not back Trump. When their own conscience is seared by some statement that Trump has made, I have encouraged them to be direct and also, in a timely manner, repudiate what he said, he told The NY Times. (August 7, 2016) Dave Reichert: UNDECIDEDThe Washington congressman, who represents a district just east of Seattle, said in an interview with KIRO radio that he would never endorse Trump. But he also said he wouldn't vote for Clinton, and when pressed on whether he would vote for Trump, he added, I never said I wouldn't vote for him, I just said I wouldn't endorse him.  (August 11, 2016) Mark Sanford: YEAThe South Carolina conservative and former governor (as you may recall) is backing Trump   he writes in a NY Times   calling on the nominee to release his tax returns. I am a conservative Republican who, though I have no stomach for his personal style and his penchant for regularly demeaning others, intends to support my party's nominee because of the importance of filling the existing vacancy on the Supreme Court, and others that might open in the next four years.  (August 16, 2016) Reid Ribble: NAYThe Wisconsin congressman has consistently been an outspoken Trump critic. He said in December that he would not back Trump if he became the nominee. In June, he said Trump was likely to be a racist.  Now, along with Representative Scott Rigell and a slew of operatives, he has signed a letter asking the RNC to withdraw resources from the Trump campaign and concentrate on holding Congress. (August 16, 2016) Mitch McConnell: YEAThe Senate majority leader issued a statement tepidly backing Trump. I have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters, and Trump, the presumptive nominee is now on the verge of clinching that nomination, he said. (May 4, 2016) Ted Cruz: APPARENT NAY (was UNDECIDED) The Texas senator made his opinion about Trump fairly clear when he was given a prized speaking slot at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Cruz refused to endorse the nominee, offering some barbed,   comments like this: Don't stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.  He was booed off the stage. Trump then said he'd refuse to accept Cruz's endorsement if offered, which doesn't seem likely to be an issue. Cruz had previously floated the idea   likely unrealistic   of reanimating his suspending campaign and refused to endorse Trump. We'll see what happens as the months go forward, I think we need to watch and see what the candidates say and do, he told Glenn Beck. (May 10, 2016) In dropping out of the Republican race after losing to Trump, Cruz did not make any indication whether he was willing to back his rival. (May 3, 2016) Jeff Sessions: YEAThe Alabama senator was Trump's first endorser from the Senate, and he has been a   backer and adviser to Trump's campaign. Susan Collins: NAY (was UNDECIDED) The moderate Maine senator writes in a Washington Post column that she has decided she cannot vote for Trump. I have become increasingly dismayed by his constant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize, she writes. But it was his attacks directed at people who could not respond on an equal footing   either because they do not share his power or stature or because professional responsibility precluded them from engaging at such a level   that revealed Mr. Trump as unworthy of being our president.  She has not said for whom she will vote. (August 9, 2016) Collins previously told Time that she was in    mode. I've said from the point that it became obvious that Trump was going to be the Republican candidate that I'd always supported previous presidential nominees of my party but that in this case I was going to wait and see what happened and that is what I am continuing to do.  (June 7, 2016) Having previously said that her backing from Trump would be contingent upon a shift in his rhetoric, Collins then said she would support the nominee. (May 6, 2016) Collins said: I have always supported the Republican nominee for president, and I suspect I would do so this year, but I do want see what Trump does from here on out.  To win her vote, He's going to have stop with gratuitous personal insults, she said, amusingly. (May 4, 2016) John McCain: YEAThe Arizona senator and 2008 Republicans presidential nominee, who is in a tight reelection battle, released a scorching statement criticizing Trump for his comments about Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, but he did not revoke his support. (August 1, 2016) McCain has said publicly that he'll back the nominee. In a private recording obtained by Politico, however, he frets that Trump endangers his reelection effort, while his former top aide Mark Salter is backing Clinton. (May 5, 2016) Kelly Ayotte: YEALike her friend John McCain, the New Hampshire senator attacked Trump for his feud with Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, pronouncing herself appalled but giving no indication that she will withdraw backing for Trump. (August 1, 2016) Ayotte, who is also in a tight reelection battle, previously said she plans to support but not endorse Trump, whatever that means. (May 5, 2016) Rand Paul: YEAIn a fascinating interview with WDRB (via Reason) the Kentucky senator and former presidential candidate said citizens should vote their conscience, while suggesting that he was only publicly backing Trump because he had pledged during the primary to support the nominee. I've made my complaints about our nominee quite explicit. I continue to do so, but also don't see it as my job now   the thing is, is: I do think that my word is important. I signed a document, not under duress, but I signed a document saying I wouldn't run as a third party and I will support the nominee.  (August 2, 2016) Paul has said he will support Trump. (His father,   and presidential contender Ron Paul, says he will not.) (May 4, 2016) Lindsey Graham: NAYThe South Carolina senator and former presidential candidate blasted Trump following the nominee's attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel, saying fellow Republicans should withdraw their endorsements. This is the most   thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy, he said. If anybody was looking for an   this is probably it. There'll come a time when the love of country will trump hatred of Hillary.  (June 7, 2016) Graham was one of Trump's most prominent critics during the primary, even endorsing Cruz even though he'd previously likened the choice between him and Trump to a choice between poisoning and being shot. The day Trump won Indiana, Graham tweeted: If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed. .... ..and we will deserve it. Graham says he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton. (May 6, 2016) Ben Sasse: NAYThe Nebraska freshman senator was another   ringleader, and has been suggested as a   candidate. In a long Facebook post, he explained why he's still not backing Trump. (May 4, 2016) Marco Rubio: SOFT YEAThe Florida senator and former presidential candidate said he does not plan to attend the Republican National Convention, but he has not made any statement changing his stance on Trump. (July 6, 2016) In an interview with The Weekly Standard, Rubio said that although he has backed Trump, who he views as preferable to Clinton, he still believes what he said during the presidential campaign: That Trump is unfit for the presidency and cannot be trusted with the nation's nuclear arsenal. (June 9, 2016) Rubio, who previously referred to Trump as a con artist, now says he backs Trump, will attend the Republican National Convention, and will release his remaining delegates to Trump. I want to be helpful. I don't want to be harmful, because I don't want Clinton to be president, he told Jake Tapper. (May 26, 2016) Rubio had previously not spoken about the race since Trump became the presumptive nominee, but in late April he said that he'd support Trump in order to beat Clinton. (April 21, 2016) Rob Portman: YEAThe Ohio senator, who's locked in a tough reelection fight, has previously said he'd back the Republican nominee. Most recently, he said that having Trump on the ticket would be positive for his own hopes. (May 5, 2016) Richard Burr: YEAThe North Carolinian, who also faces a tough reelection, supports Trump. (May 4, 2016)  : I look forward to working with Mr. Trump at the top of the ticket and to maintaining a #Republicans Senate. Roy Blunt: YEAThe Missourian, who is up for reelection, says he will support the nominee. (May, 5, 2016) Ron Johnson: YEAThe Wisconsin senator, who is battling predecessor Russ Feingold, is one of the most precarious Republicans this year. He tepidly backed Trump. As Ron has repeatedly said for months, he intends to support the Republican nominee, but he's focused on the concerns of Wisconsinites   not national political winds, a spokesman told Roll Call. (May 5, 2016) Pat Toomey: UNDECIDEDThe Pennsylvania senator, another endangered incumbent, has not made up his mind. As I have said repeatedly, I have not endorsed Trump, he said at a press conference. There are things that he has said, a number of things he has said and done that give me great pause and I have significant concerns about, so I remain in a mode of waiting to be persuaded. I've not made a final decision on what I'm going to do. Clinton is completely unacceptable to me.  (August 10, 2016) Toomey previously said: It certainly looks like Trump is on his way to the nomination .       Trump was not my first choice. He wasn't my second choice or third or fourth choice. I have lots have differences with Trump and lots of problems with him but I am absolutely in the never Clinton' camp.  (May 4, 2016) Mark Kirk: NAY (was YEA) The Illinois senator, one of this year's most endangered incumbents, says he will write in Colin Powell for president. (August 11, 2016) Kirk previously announced that he is no longer supporting Trump   the first Republican to rescind his backing. After much consideration, I have concluded that Trump has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to assume the greatest office in the world, he said.  (June 7, 2016) Kirk previously said he'd back Trump if nominated. Tom Cotton: YEAThe   Arkansas senator weakly endorsed Trump. I've long said that I will support the Republican nominee because we can't afford a third   term, he said. He had previously criticized Trump for mocking John McCain, but also said Trump would be a more serious leader for our country that Clinton. (May 5, 2016) Bob Corker: YEAThe Tennessee senator, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has said he is willing to help Trump. Corker praised Trump's otherwise widely panned   address and is reportedly talking to him about overseas matters. He's been mentioned as VP candidate. (May 10, 2016) Mike Lee: UNDECIDEDLee, a conservative Utahan and close associate of Ted Cruz, has not made his decision, but lashed out at conservative radio host Steve Malzberg for pressing him to back Trump. We can get into the fact that he accused my best friend's father of conspiring to kill JFK, he said. We can go through the fact that he's made statements that some have identified correctly as religiously intolerant. We can get into the fact that he's wildly unpopular in my state, in part because my state consists of people who are members of a religious minority church.  He didn't, however, rule out backing Trump in the future. (June 30, 2016) Lee previously expressed reservations. I have not supported Trump up to this point, I have not endorsed him, Lee said, according to the Washington Examiner. I have some concerns with him. He scares me to death so does Clinton       . I'll make the decision as best I can, but I'm not there yet.  (May 11, 2016) Orrin Hatch: YEAThe Utah senator, a longtime Washington fixture, backed Marco Rubio in the primary. After meeting with Trump on May 12, he said, I totally endorse him.  Hatch also offered to help Trump pick Supreme Court nominees   moving to dampen one of the biggest conservative objections to Trump, which is that he can't be trusted to select justices. (May 12, 2016) Tim Scott: YEAThe South Carolinian, the Republicans's only black senator, quietly backed Trump after supporting Marco Rubio in the primary. He called Trump's comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel racially toxic, but is not rescinding his endorsement. (June 7, 2016) Jeff Flake: NAYThe Arizona senator says he cannot at this point back Trump. It's uncomfortable not having endorsed the Republican nominee, I have to say, he said. But I can't at this point. I hope to be able to support the nominee. I certainly can't right now.  (June 7, 2016) John Cornyn: YEAThe Texas senator said in May, I'm for the nominee of the party if it's Trump, I'll support him wholeheartedly.  He's gone back and forth, warning in February that Trump could be an albatross around the   races.  More recently, he's announced he simply won't talk about Trump. Wish me luck, he said. (June 15, 2016) Dean Heller: SOFT NAYThe Nevada senator told Politico he is currently opposed to Trump, though he wouldn't rule out changing his mind. Today, I'm opposed to his campaign, he said. He did a lot of damage. It's very difficult for him, as far as I'm concerned, to recover from his previous comments. I'll give him a chance, but at this point, I have no intentions of voting for him.  (June 30, 2016) Lisa Murkowski: UNDECIDEDThe Alaska senator, who has turned particularly moderate since the 2010 election, in which she lost a Republicans primary but won reelection as a   candidate, tells the AP she has not made up her mind about the election. I've got a few months to listen, as other Americans are, to what is laid down in terms of policy, and we'll figure it out, she said. (August 10, 2016) Cory Gardner: YEAAt a rally, the Colorado senator gave Trump a backhanded endorsement. I'm voting Republican up and down the ticket. A Republican president will make a difference, even a Republican president named Trump, he said. Gardner previously called Trump a buffoon.  (August 18, 2016) Chris Christie: YEAThe New Jersey governor and former presidential candidate was Trump's first major establishment endorser, and has been a staunch ally. Paul LePage: YEAMaine's   governor had backed Christie, but he quickly endorsed Trump after Christie did. John Kasich: SOFT NAYThe Ohio governor and final Republican challenger to leave the race has not entirely slammed the door on backing Trump, but he said he cannot do so now. We'll see where it ends up. I'm not making any final decision yet, but at this point, I just can't do it, he said. (June 16, 2016) Kasich previously had not said whether he'll back Trump. In his comments leaving the race, Kasich pointedly did not mention Trump or indicate his leaning. (May 4, 2016) Nikki Haley: YEAThe governor of South Carolina tangled with Trump ahead of that state's primary, and was elegantly withering toward him at the time. But she says she will back him. I have great respect for the will of the people, and as I have always said, I will support the Republican nominee for president, she said. (May 4, 2016) Brian Sandoval: UNDECIDED (was YEA) The Nevada governor, a moderate conservative, once said he would back the Republicans nominee, but now says he is not sure.

The board also criticized the move for a   candidate, irking Bill Kristol. Joe Scarborough: UNDECIDED (was SOFT YEA) The MSNBC host and token network conservative was among the friendliest voices in the media toward Trump during the Republican primary.

136,58432,80113,Apeirophobia: The Fear of Eternity,Atlantic,Bobby Azarian,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"        , The first time I thought about heaven, it terrified me. I was 4 years old, and my grandfather had just passed away after a   battle with cancer. My family tried to console me by explaining that he went to a beautiful, calm, and happy place, where he would be united with all his loved ones, forever and ever. That night, I lay in bed in pitch darkness and tried to grasp what they had told me. But every time I thought I had a grip on eternity, it slipped further away. The largest number of years I could imagine failed to make a dent in infinity. My primitive brain filled with an existential angst. The idea of living forever was even more unsettling than the idea of no longer existing after death. Woody Allen once said, “Eternity is a very long time, especially toward the end!” Eternity sounds great on the surface, but actually experiencing it may be an entirely different matter. For some people, the very notion of infinity sends chills up the spine. In fact, for many who suffer from “apeirophobia” —  a term for the fear of eternity —  the thought of an existence that goes on forever amounts to torture. “I remember the first time it hit me,” writes Kellie, the username of an anonymous commenter on the pop culture website YOMYOMF, which featured a brief story about an actor's experience with apeirophobia . “I was around 8 years old. Now I'm in my 30s, and the thought of eternity still freaks me out. It usually hits at night when I'm trying to sleep. I've learned to push it out of my mind, but sometimes I can't, and when that happens I start pacing the room and thinking that I might have to go to the emergency room or else I might kill myself. ” Search for apeirophobia on Google and you'll find hundreds, if not thousands, of   posts and comments similar to this on popular Internet forums like Reddit, Quora, and Yahoo! Answers. Websites dedicated to phobia help and support, such as Phobia Fear Release and MedHelp, all have comment threads on apeirophobia, too. On these sites, Apeirophobes share experiences and swap advice. Even though most describe dealing with unrelenting anxiety, many seem comforted by knowing they aren't alone. Despite all this discussion, there is so little research on apeirophobia that it lacks its own Wikipedia entry. It is not explicitly recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the American Psychiatric Association's standard reference for psychiatry, but it does meet their criteria for a “specific phobia,” which is classified as an anxiety disorder. It is included on many sites with informal phobia lists, but it is absent from the websites of the Mayo Clinic and the National Institute of Mental Health, as well as WebMD. A Google Scholar search doesn't yield a single quantitative study on the phobia. Grasping for some sense of its prevalence, I posted on Facebook, asking if anyone had experience with apeirophobia. I received considerably more responses than expected. One friend said that he used to get so overwhelmed during sermons in early adolescence that he felt physically sick. Another wrote, “The thought of eternity still fills me with anxiety when I wake up from naps. My solution: I stopped napping. ” Where does this fear come from? A realization that an eternal afterlife could become infinitely repetitive? The recognition that one lacks control over their own destiny? Martin Wiener, a former colleague of mine at George Mason University who researches the neural underpinnings of time perception, notes that the brain region hypothesized to control   planning, the frontal lobe, is one of the last to develop in humans as they grow. “In adolescence, there is a dawning realization that occurs where one realizes they will become an adult,” Wiener says. “I suspect that, in apeirophobia, one comes to the ‘realization' that after death you will live forever (if you believe this) and in simulating that experience in your mind, one realizes that there is no way to project ahead to ‘forever' —  and that experience is, inherently,  . As such, the anxiety that these folks are feeling may not be much different than the fear of growing up, getting old, or death. ” Maybe human brains, as finite instruments with limited cognitive and computational capacities, are   not hardwired to have a conception of something completely absent from sensory experience. Evolution has done just fine without organisms that contemplate infinity, after all. Doing so wouldn't have likely offered any survival advantages to   humans. Wiener's explanation would predict that apeirophobia creeps up in younger stages of life, and although we cannot know anything for sure without sufficient data, the reports scattered across the web seem to roughly match this concept. But there does seem to be a small percentage of people with apeirophobia who first experienced fear even before adolescence, such as myself. For that, Wiener offers a different —  but likely compatible —  idea regarding the phenomenon: What if a fear of the afterlife is simply a religious manifestation of a fear of death that's innate in everyone? “Terror Management Theory, which is derived from Ernest Becker's 1973 Pulitzer   work of philosophy and psychology The Denial of Death, essentially says people in modern civilization are all walking around in denial of our mortality —  and that culture, religion, and entertainment all exist for the purpose of distraction,” Wiener explains. “The idea is that these things keep us from thinking about our own deaths, and that systematically, people are repressing this fear. The fear of eternity could just be that same fear manifesting itself in a different way. ” There shouldn't be too many atheists who fear of eternity, since they reject the idea of an afterlife, Wiener says. But that doesn't mean that those who aren't religious are immune to existential anxiety. Infinity, after all, doesn't pertain only to time it can also apply to space. “I feel that we are all insignificant compared to the universe,” wrote Jamie Adkins, a nurse and longtime friend of mine, in response to my Facebook post. “When I start to think beyond our solar system, it is as if my thoughts automatically stop to protect myself from having some form of a panic attack. The knowledge of black holes will give me nightmares for days. The thought of the distance between galaxies is unbearable. ” She likened the experience to Horton Hears a Who. “We are on this tiny flower and can be blown away any second. ” It's an   anxiety. In the 17th century, the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal described in Pensées, how both infinite space and time shook him to the core: “When I consider the short duration of my life, swallowed up in the eternity before and after, the little space which I fill, and even can see, engulfed in the infinite immensity of spaces of which I am ignorant, and which know me not, I am frightened, and am astonished at being here rather than there for there is no reason why here rather than there, why now rather than then. ” Bilbo Baggins, burdened with unusually long life thanks to the almighty ring in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, put it this way: “I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread. ” Although some apeirophobics have benefitted from treatments like medication and cognitive behavioral therapy, others have found no way to mitigate the existential terror. Personally, I'm no better at grasping infinity than I was at 4. But rather than trying to comprehend eternity, now I just avoid the thought altogether.

The idea of living forever was even more unsettling than the idea of no longer existing after death. Woody Allen once said, Eternity is a very long time, especially toward the end! Eternity sounds great on the surface, but actually experiencing it may be an entirely different matter. For some people, the very notion of infinity sends chills up the spine. In fact, for many who suffer from apeirophobia   a term for the fear of eternity   the thought of an existence that goes on forever amounts to torture. I remember the first time it hit me, writes Kellie, the username of an anonymous commenter on the pop culture website YOMYOMF, which featured a brief story about an actor's experience with apeirophobia . I was around 8 years old. Now I'm in my 30s, and the thought of eternity still freaks me out. It usually hits at night when I'm trying to sleep. I've learned to push it out of my mind, but sometimes I can't, and when that happens I start pacing the room and thinking that I might have to go to the emergency room or else I might kill myself.  Search for apeirophobia on Google and you'll find hundreds, if not thousands, of   posts and comments similar to this on popular Internet forums like Reddit, Quora, and Yahoo! Answers. Websites dedicated to phobia help and support, such as Phobia Fear Release and MedHelp, all have comment threads on apeirophobia, too. On these sites, Apeirophobes share experiences and swap advice. Even though most describe dealing with unrelenting anxiety, many seem comforted by knowing they aren't alone. Despite all this discussion, there is so little research on apeirophobia that it lacks its own Wikipedia entry. It is not explicitly recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the American Psychiatric Association's standard reference for psychiatry, but it does meet their criteria for a specific phobia, which is classified as an anxiety disorder. It is included on many sites with informal phobia lists, but it is absent from the websites of the Mayo Clinic and the National Institute of Mental Health, as well as WebMD. A Google Scholar search doesn't yield a single quantitative study on the phobia. Grasping for some sense of its prevalence, I posted on Facebook, asking if anyone had experience with apeirophobia. I received considerably more responses than expected. One friend said that he used to get so overwhelmed during sermons in early adolescence that he felt physically sick. Another wrote, The thought of eternity still fills me with anxiety when I wake up from naps. My solution: I stopped napping.  Where does this fear come from? A realization that an eternal afterlife could become infinitely repetitive? The recognition that one lacks control over their own destiny? Martin Wiener, a former colleague of mine at George Mason University who researches the neural underpinnings of time perception, notes that the brain region hypothesized to control   planning, the frontal lobe, is one of the last to develop in humans as they grow. In adolescence, there is a dawning realization that occurs where one realizes they will become an adult, Wiener says. I suspect that, in apeirophobia, one comes to the realization' that after death you will live forever (if you believe this) and in simulating that experience in your mind, one realizes that there is no way to project ahead to forever'   and that experience is, inherently,  . As such, the anxiety that these folks are feeling may not be much different than the fear of growing up, getting old, or death.  Maybe human brains, as finite instruments with limited cognitive and computational capacities, are   not hardwired to have a conception of something completely absent from sensory experience. Evolution has done just fine without organisms that contemplate infinity, after all. Doing so wouldn't have likely offered any survival advantages to   humans. Wiener's explanation would predict that apeirophobia creeps up in younger stages of life, and although we cannot know anything for sure without sufficient data, the reports scattered across the web seem to roughly match this concept. But there does seem to be a small percentage of people with apeirophobia who first experienced fear even before adolescence, such as myself. For that, Wiener offers a different   but likely compatible   idea regarding the phenomenon: What if a fear of the afterlife is simply a religious manifestation of a fear of death that's innate in everyone? Terror Management Theory, which is derived from Ernest Becker's 1973 Pulitzer   work of philosophy and psychology The Denial of Death, essentially says people in modern civilization are all walking around in denial of our mortality   and that culture, religion, and entertainment all exist for the purpose of distraction, Wiener explains. The idea is that these things keep us from thinking about our own deaths, and that systematically, people are repressing this fear. The fear of eternity could just be that same fear manifesting itself in a different way.  There shouldn't be too many atheists who fear of eternity, since they reject the idea of an afterlife, Wiener says. But that doesn't mean that those who aren't religious are immune to existential anxiety. Infinity, after all, doesn't pertain only to time it can also apply to space. I feel that we are all insignificant compared to the universe, wrote Jamie Adkins, a nurse and longtime friend of mine, in response to my Facebook post. When I start to think beyond our solar system, it is as if my thoughts automatically stop to protect myself from having some form of a panic attack. The knowledge of black holes will give me nightmares for days. The thought of the distance between galaxies is unbearable.  She likened the experience to Horton Hears a Who. We are on this tiny flower and can be blown away any second.  It's an   anxiety. In the 17th century, the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal described in Penses, how both infinite space and time shook him to the core: When I consider the short duration of my life, swallowed up in the eternity before and after, the little space which I fill, and even can see, engulfed in the infinite immensity of spaces of which I am ignorant, and which know me not, I am frightened, and am astonished at being here rather than there for there is no reason why here rather than there, why now rather than then.  Bilbo Baggins, burdened with unusually long life thanks to the almighty ring in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, put it this way: I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.  Although some apeirophobics have benefitted from treatments like medication and cognitive behavioral therapy, others have found no way to mitigate the existential terror. Personally, I'm no better at grasping infinity than I was at 4. But rather than trying to comprehend eternity, now I just avoid the thought altogether.

Sneddon's family claims on a website devoted to the search for him that they believe Sneddon was kidnapped by North Korea and is being held hostage there. The claim appears to have stemmed from information gathered over the years and recent comments from Choi   head of South Korea's Abductees' Family Union. On Wednesday, a Japanese news source reported that Sneddon was abducted by agents of the North Korean government and whisked away some 2, 500 miles from the Chinese province where he vanished.

Moreover, 37 percent feel it's “very likely” an attack will happen soon.  While that's down from the high of 43 percent in 2007, it's up from 24 percent who felt that way in 2011 (the last time this question was asked on a Fox News Poll). Some 54 percent think the USA is less safe now than before the September 11 attacks.    percent say the country is safer.  Last year, it was   percent (March 2015).  This is a fairly recent shift.

CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS, Almost all Republicans (91 percent) and most independents (84 percent) think a major attack is likely soon.  Fewer Democrats, although still a majority, agree (67 percent).  Similarly, 52 percent of Democrats think the country is safer today, while 55 percent of independents and 70 percent of Republicans feel the opposite. By a   percent margin, voters trust Clinton over Trump to do a better job handling the issue of terrorism.  Earlier this month the candidates were tied on the issue, while voters trusted Trump over Clinton by 12 points in May (  percent).   “You might think that since people increasingly feel less safe than before   that this would be reflected in job ratings for Obama and, as a result, Clinton, as his preferred successor. But that isn't the case,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Republican pollster Daron Shaw.  “Obama's approval rating is at a high point for his second term    and voters see Clinton as the best candidate to handle terrorism.  That should really concern Trump. ” Since May, trust in Clinton to handle terrorism is up 13 points among both Democrats and independents, and up 3 points among Republicans. The issue of terrorism is second only to the economy when voters prioritize problems facing the country.  Thirty percent say the economy is the top issue, while 18 percent cite terrorism, and 10 percent say education.  Here's the rest of the list:  health care (8 percent) the federal deficit and race relations (6 percent each) foreign policy, climate change, and immigration (4 percent each) and drug addiction (2 percent). Earlier this month, the economy and terrorism were tied (22 percent each).  Current ratings are more in line with those from April, when 32 percent put the economy on top and 15 percent said terrorism. Meanwhile, 54 percent of voters think last year's nuclear deal with Iran has made the U. S. less safe.  Republicans (76 percent) are much more likely than independents (59 percent) and Democrats (30 percent) to feel that way.  The U. S. agreement with Iran lifts sanctions for 10 years in exchange for Iran curtailing its pursuit of a nuclear program over that time period. One in three voters (31 percent) thinks the deal has made the U. S. safer    a slight improvement over 26 percent a year ago (September 2015).  The poll also asks about the White House's position that the $400 million dollars the U. S. recently paid Iran was not a ransom payment for the release of American prisoners.  Voters disagree: by a   percent margin, they say it was ransom. Obama has had a net positive job rating for most of 2016, and that trend continues:  54 percent of voters approve of the job he's doing, while 43 percent disapprove.   This is Obama's highest approval rating since May 2011, soon after U. S. forces killed Usama bin Laden (  percent).  Earlier this month, it was   percent (July   2, 2016).

","That's according to the latest Fox News Poll. It's tough to say who stinks more.  A large   minority says both Clinton and Trump are “terrible” candidates.  Voters dislike each    and say they are dishonest and lack empathy.   Only 35 percent say Trump is honest and trustworthy, barely better than the 31 percent who say Clinton is.   Less than half of voters say “cares about people like me” fits Clinton (47 percent) and Trump (37 percent).

Here are the top five takeaways.    Nearly one third thinks the election is rigged, either for Clinton (23 percent) for Trump (5 percent) or who knows (4 percent).  Democrats (74 percent) are much more likely than Republicans (56 percent) and independents (54 percent) to say it is not rigged.      A handful of voters are concerned Clinton (24 percent) and Trump (15 percent) may not be physically fit enough to be president.  That includes about    of each candidate's own party.       Sixty percent think Trump is “hiding something” in his tax returns.  By comparison, 44 percent say Clinton set up a private email server to “hide things. ”    percent say she did so for convenience.        percent of voters think it's likely the Clintons were selling influence to foreign contributors who made donations to the ClintonFoundation.  Even 43 percent of Democrats believe that.    By a   margin, more think it is fair for Clinton to call Trump a racist (46 percent) than it is for Trump to call Clinton a bigot (27 percent).  Thirteen percent of Democrats think it's fair to call Clinton a bigot, while 20 percent of Republicans say it's justified to call Trump a racist. The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1, 011 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw  Company Research (R) from August   2016.  The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters.   ",False,"That's according to the latest Fox News Poll. It's tough to say who stinks more.  A large   minority says both Clinton and Trump are terrible candidates.  Voters dislike each    and say they are dishonest and lack empathy.   Only 35 percent say Trump is honest and trustworthy, barely better than the 31 percent who say Clinton is.   Less than half of voters say cares about people like me fits Clinton (47 percent) and Trump (37 percent). Just over half see Clinton (51 percent) and Trump (51 percent) as being a strong leader.

See Latest Coverage  CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS, However, that doesn't translate into being a reliable leader.   Some 38 percent say that describes Trump, down from 46 percent in May.    percent feel a reliable leader fits Clinton, up from 43 percent.   Most voters say Clinton (74 percent) and Trump (68 percent) will do anything to get elected. On the plus side, 78 percent say intelligent describes Clinton, while 57 percent think that fits Trump. Typically, partisans become more positive toward their candidate in the last two months of the campaign they rationalize their vote, says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democratic pollster Chris Anderson. But this tendency has been muted here, as the events of the past week    Clinton's troubles with the emails and her foundation, Trump's refusal to release his tax returns    have reinforced the skepticism many have about the character of the major party candidates. A   42 percent view Trump favorably, while 56 percent view him unfavorably.  That's a net negative rating of   points.  Earlier this month it was   (  percent).   For Clinton, 45 percent have a positive opinion of her vs. 53 percent negative.  That gives her a net negative of   points.  She was at   in early August (  percent).   Pollpourri, The poll, released Wednesday, asks voters about some of the uglier campaigning.  Here are the top five takeaways.    Nearly one third thinks the election is rigged, either for Clinton (23 percent) for Trump (5 percent) or who knows (4 percent).  Democrats (74 percent) are much more likely than Republicans (56 percent) and independents (54 percent) to say it is not rigged.      A handful of voters are concerned Clinton (24 percent) and Trump (15 percent) may not be physically fit enough to be president.  That includes about    of each candidate's own party.       Sixty percent think Trump is hiding something in his tax returns.

The AP had objected to the delays. The daily schedules drew attention last week after the AP reviewed the two years of schedules released so far, plus Clinton's official calendars. From those, the AP determined that more than half the people who Clinton met or spoke with  —   outside of members of the U. S. or foreign governments  —   had donated to the ClintonFoundation either personally or through companies or groups. The AP's review focused on Clinton's discretionary contacts with outside interests and excluded her meetings or calls with federal officials or foreign government representatives, because those contacts were part of her regular diplomatic obligations. Clinton has said the AP's analysis was flawed because it did not account fully for all meetings and phone calls during her entire term as secretary. She also said the analysis should have included meetings with federal employees and foreign diplomats. The State Department's decision Thursday to turn over all of the   daily schedules by Oct. 17 means it will have to triple its pace of producing 600 pages a month. That production schedule was ordered last January by U. S. District Court Judge Richard Leon. The AP first asked for all Clinton's calendars in 2010 and again in 2013 under the U. S.

","  The Romanian hacker who first exposed Clinton's use of personal email for government business was sentenced by a federal judge Thursday to 52 months in prison    and in a surprising development, Romanian authorities now want the    “Guccifer,” who continues to cooperate with U. S. investigators, sent home ”right away.” The hacker, whose real name is Marcel Lehel Lazar, breached the AOL account of longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal in 2013, and posted online the Clintonemail. com address. It was this revelation that ultimately led to the identification of Clinton's personal account and multiple servers, where sensitive government records were transmitted along with personal communications and ClintonFoundation business. Lazar, looking alert and with neatly trimmed hair, appeared in the Alexandria, Va. courtroom for the   hearing before U. S. District Judge James C. Cacheris. Prosecutors said the hacker took responsibility for his actions but showed no remorse for accessing the private online accounts of at least 100 Americans, and causing the public release of their information.   His   victims include Dorothy Bush Koch, the sister of former President George W. Bush former StateSecretary Colin Powell and Blumenthal, among others. After breaching Powell's account, Lazar said he identified Blumenthal in the contact list and successfully targeted him. Court documents filed Monday by the government say by ”the defendant's own estimate, his quote 'success rate' at gaining entry into private accounts was only   percent of his attempts.” Lazar said he used a   system to show which accounts were successfully breached. “From what I remember I was using red for accounts I hacked, orange for the ones I could hack, and green for the ones I tried to hack and was not able to,” he said, according to a heavily redacted FBI interview released by the court on Monday. Lazar is not a programmer, but appears to have a strong understanding of social networks and did extensive research on his targets, using publicly available biographical information, a cell phone and an old computer to successfully guess security questions to reset the account passwords. In May, he pleaded guilty to two counts of a   indictment  —   one involving the breach of Powell's personal account the other involving the account of a former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs. The Blumenthal hack is not connected to either charge. His public defender, Shannon Quill, asked for a more lenient sentence of 36 months, arguing he did not profit from the crimes. Quill said the separation from his family, including a young daughter, has been hard. Further, she indicated the Romanians now want him back to finish his   sentence there, which he'd been serving in his home country before his extradition to the U. S. That sentence is connected to the same series of hacks. His attorney indicated he could be sent back in the coming weeks, though a timeframe was not clear. Together with the sentence in the U. S. Quill said this would amount to ”a total global sentence of 10 years.” Cacheris, though, pressed both sides on how a transfer to Romania might work. The judge and lawyers for both sides all noted that Lazar continues to cooperate with U. S. investigators, though court filings did not provide detail beyond the hacker's efforts to recover the personal information of his victims and close security loopholes connected to their accounts.   The heavily redacted 2014 FBI interview also said Lazar claimed “since June the CIA knew where I lived, a fact I found out from the press, when the CIA chief paid visits to Romania and Russia, where he obtained my IP addresses. ”  Lazar was extradited to the U. S. in late March after considerable time, effort and expense by the U. S. government. There was no mention in court of Guccifer's claims earlier this year to NBC and Fox News that he had successfully breached Clinton's server on a handful of occasions. ”For me, it was easy . .. easy for me, for everybody,” Lazar told Fox News from his Alexandria jail in May, claiming he used Blumenthal's account as a stepping stone to the Clinton server.  In July, when asked by Congress about this claim, FBI Director James Comey said Guccifer lied about the breach. When Comey recommended against criminal charges for Clinton and her aides, over the use of multiple personal servers for government business, he emphasized that members of Clinton's inner circle were hacked, suggesting the personal server was vulnerable. ”We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account,” he said. Fox News met with Guccifer at the Alexandria detention center earlier this year, and conducted interviews by phone. Fox News has pending requests to interview Guccifer as part of its ongoing reporting of the Clinton email case and recent breaches of political committees by   cyber militias. The targeting of the U. S. electoral process was noted by Cacheris in court. Guccifer told Fox News he always used Russian proxy servers for his attacks. Fox News also has an outstanding FOIA request with the U. S. Marshals for Lazar's mug shot. At the close of the hearing, Lazar was remanded to the Marshals' custody.

","Grand jurors indicted James Halsell Jr. who turns 60 on Friday, on two counts each of reckless murder and assault, said Tuscaloosa County prosecutor Jonathan Cross. The Huntsville resident was arrested on reckless murder charges after the June 6 wreck that killed    Niomi James and    Jayla Parler in the west Alabama county. Police reports show investigators believe alcohol and speed could be factors. The reckless murder charges involve the girls' deaths, Cross said, and the assault charges stem from injuries suffered by the girls' father, Pernell James of Brent, who was driving, and his female friend, Shontel Cutts. Halsell is free on bond. A lawyer representing him, James Sturdivant, declined comment on the indictment. The girls' relatives filed two civil lawsuits blaming Halsell for the deaths. Halsell's attorneys have filed a document in one of those cases saying the driver of the car carrying the girls failed to yield and contributed to the wreck. The girls' father told investigators he was driving about 65 mph on U. S. 82 when a car traveling ”at a very high rate of speed” struck his Ford Fiesta from the rear, crushing the Ford and sending it tumbling across the road, court documents state. A sworn statement by a state trooper said Halsell was driving a rental car at the time and told officers he thought he was on Interstate   not U. S. 82. Troopers said the girls were ejected. Halsell was driving to his native Louisiana to pick up his son at the time of the crash and was so intoxicated that he asked to see the victims' bodies, the trooper's statement said. The girls lived with their mother in Houston and their father, Pernell James of Brent, was returning home from Texas with them and a woman for a summertime visit, according to Brent Mayor Dennis Stripling. Court documents do not indicate that Halsell mentioned his career to officers, and a trooper spokesman has said authorities didn't realize he was a former astronaut until they saw news reports about the case. An online biography by NASA said Halsell's career with the space agency included five shuttle flights starting in 1994. He spent more than 1, 250 hours in space, serving as commander on three shuttle missions and pilot on two others. After the space shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, Halsell helped lead NASA's    effort.

","“This is the future    the border is a very dangerous place,” an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official told FoxNews. com, citing the threat of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) snipers,   missiles and terrorist tunnels. “Sending unmanned vehicles to do these patrols means that troops lives' are not at risk. ” Working with Israeli defense specialist Elbit Systems, IDF has equipped Ford   pickup trucks with specialized remote driving technology. The trucks, dubbed Border Protector Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) are also fitted with four driving cameras and a   observation camera to help operators identify threats. At the moment, the vehicles are unarmed. UGV testing began in July 2015 and the trucks became operational in February. Currently, each vehicle is driven by an operator in a remote control room using a steering wheel, joystick and pedals. In the next few months, the Israeli Army aims to deploy the UGVs   with the vehicle driving toward a map coordinate set by its operator. The trucks, however, will still need their operators to guide them around any obstacles in their path.   the trucks will need less human intervention. “In the future, we will have the capability of fully autonomous driving,” the IDF official added, noting that the UGVs will autonomously navigate any obstacles in their path. Troops can also drive the UGVs traditionally from the driver's seat. IDF declined to reveal how many UGVs are in operation or the exact timeframe for autonomous operation. Plans are also in place to add a weapon to the vehicle. “We think at the beginning of next year, we will get a machine gun on the vehicle that will be operated from a control room  —   the machine gun will not be autonomous,” said the IDF official. The UGV replaces the   Guardium vehicle that was deployed by Israeli forces in 2009. “The Guardium was unable to navigate obstacles by itself, but the UGV will be able to,” explained the official. The Israeli Army wants to eventually deploy the UGVs on Israel's other borders with Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Israel is not the only country looking to harness autonomous military vehicles.

","  Physicians have separated a pair of conjoined twin girls who were born connected at the liver and, in a rare surgical case, at the heart, after completing a risky procedure made possible by   printing. In the operation, physicians at University of Florida Health Shands Children's Hospital had to avoid damaging the critical veins in both babies' hearts, as they were joined at the atrium —   the upper chamber where the blood enters the organ —   lead surgeon Dr. Mark Bleiweis said in a news release. “In the world, there have not been many successful separations with a cardiac connection,” Bleiweis, chief of pediatric and congenital cardiovascular surgery at UF health, said in the release. “It became a very challenging planning process for us, and, ultimately, a challenging separation. ” According to UF Health, conjoined twins occur in about one in 200, 000 live births, and survival of twins born connected at the heart is extremely rare. Often in these cases, doctors decide not to do separation surgery. Overall, only about 5 to 25 percent of conjoined twins survive. The twins at hand, named only as Scarlett and Savannah in the release, were born with a   connection, meaning they each had their own complete set of organs, but they were attached at not only the heart, but also the liver, the diaphragm and the sternum. Dr. Jennifer   director of the fetal cardiac program at Shands, began studying the twins' physiology while their mother, named only as Jacquelyn in the release, was 21 weeks pregnant. Jacquelyn said when she learned her twins were conjoined at 20 weeks pregnant, her previous doctor told her the babies likely would not survive. “We went in to find the sex of one baby and found out not only were they twins, but they were conjoined and weren't going to make it,” Jacquelyn said in the release. “Many opinions later, we found Dr.   and she told us not only were our twins going to live, but they thought they could separate them. ”   and her team produced what they said appeared to be the first   printed conjoined twin heart to help the surgical team plan and practice for the operation. “When I saw the heart structures and liver structures in utero, I had a feeling that we could separate them, but I had to examine the anatomy more closely and consult with my cardiology colleagues at the UF Health Congenital Heart Center,”   said in the release. “I was able to give them hope, yet at the same time, I told them I was cautiously optimistic.   …     We are very fortunate that this was a success. ” Dr. Saleem Islam, chief of the division of pediatric surgery in the UF College of Medicine, used an intraoperative ultrasound to navigate separation of the newborns' single large, fused liver. The technology helped Islam and his team identify parts of the liver where large blood vessels were absent. In a   to   surgery, four surgeons and two anesthesiologists, as well as a team of imaging specialists, multiple nurses and an ancillary staff successfully separated the infants. According to the release, physicians wrapped the twins with tubing and electrical wiring, and to be able to tell them apart, they wrapped orange tape on one of the twins and blue tape on the other. After their babies have undergone more than a dozen surgeries each, Jacquelyn and her partner Mark are preparing to bring them home. “I know that Mark and Jackie were told by many not to pursue this because it was daunting, and it could not and would not be successful,” Bleiweis said in the release. “Nothing gives us greater satisfaction than seeing the two twins separated, and to see both parents holding their twins. ”  ",False,"  Physicians have separated a pair of conjoined twin girls who were born connected at the liver and, in a rare surgical case, at the heart, after completing a risky procedure made possible by   printing.

","'Killer Robots By Air  …    ' '  …    And By Sea And By Land' 'CUPID'] A very, very small quadcopter, one inch in diameter can carry a   or   shaped charge. You can order them from a drone manufacturer in China. You can program the code to say: “Here are thousands of photographs of the kinds of things I want to target. ” A   shaped charge can punch a hole in nine millimeters of steel, so presumably you can also punch a hole in someone's head. You can fit about three million of those in a   . You can drive up   with three trucks and have 10 million weapons attacking NY City. They don't have to be very effective, only 5 or 10% of them have to find the target. There will be manufacturers producing millions of these weapons that people will be able to buy just like you can buy guns now, except millions of guns don't matter unless you have a million soldiers. You need only three guys to write the program and launch them. So you can just imagine that in many parts of the world humans will be hunted. They will be cowering underground in shelters and devising techniques so that they don't get detected. This is the   cloud of lethal autonomous weapons. They could be here in two to three years.  —   Stuart Russell, professor of computer science and engineering at the University of California Berkeley, Mary Wareham laughs a lot. It usually sounds the same regardless of the circumstance  —   like a mirthful giggle the blonde New Zealander can't suppress  —   but it bubbles up at the most varied moments. Wareham laughs when things are funny, she laughs when things are awkward, she laughs when she disagrees with you. And she laughs when things are truly unpleasant, like when you're talking to her about how humanity might soon be annihilated by killer robots and the world is doing nothing to stop it. One afternoon this spring at the United Nations in Geneva, I sat behind Wareham in a large     assembly room that hosted the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) a group of 121 countries that have signed the agreement to restrict weapons that “are considered to cause unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to combatants or to affect civilians indiscriminately” —   in other words, weapons humanity deems too cruel to use in war. The UN moves at a glacial pace, but the CCW is even worse. There's no vote at the end of meetings instead, every contracting party needs to agree in order to get anything done. (Its last and only successful prohibitive weapons ban was in 1995.) It was the start of five days of meetings to discuss lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS): weapons that have the ability to independently select and engage targets, i. e. machines that can make the decision to kill humans, i. e. killer robots. The world slept through the advent of drone attacks. When it came to LAWS would we do the same? Yet it's important to get one thing clear: This isn't a conversation about drones. By now, drone warfare has been normalized  —   at least 10 countries have them.   cars are tested in fleets. Twenty years ago, a computer beat Garry Kasparov at chess and, more recently, another taught itself how to beat humans at Go, a Chinese game of strategy that doesn't rely as much on patterns and probability. In July, the Dallas police department sent a robot strapped with explosives to kill an active shooter following an attack on police officers during a protest. But with LAWS, unlike the Dallas robot, the human sets the parameters of the attack without actually knowing the specific target. The weapon goes out, looks for anything within those parameters, hones in, and detonates. Examples that don't sound entirely     are things like all enemy ships in the South China Sea, all military radars in X country, all enemy tanks on the plains of Europe. But scale it up, add   actors, and you can envision strange permutations: all power stations, all schools, all hospitals, all   males carrying weapons, all   males wearing baseball caps, those with brown hair. Use your imagination. While this sounds like the kind of horror you pay to see in theaters, killer robots will shortly be arriving at your front door for free courtesy of Russia, China, or the US, all of which are racing to develop them. “There are really no technological breakthroughs that are required,” Russell, the computer science professor, told me. “Every one of the component technology is available in some form commercially   …     It's really a matter of just how much resources are invested in it. ” LAWS are generally broken down into three categories. Most simply, there's humans in the loop  —   where the machine performs the task under human supervision, arriving at the target and waiting for permission to fire. Humans on the loop  —   where the machine gets to the place and takes out the target, but the human can override the system. And then, humans out of the loop  —   where the human releases the machine to perform a task and that's it  —   no supervision, no recall, no stop function. The debate happening at the UN is which of these to preemptively ban, if any at all. Wareham, the advocacy director of the Human Rights Watch arms division, is the coordinator of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, a coalition of 61 international NGOs, 12 of which had sent delegations to the CCW. Unlike drones, which entered the battlefield as surveillance technology and were weaponized later, the campaign is trying to ban LAWS before they happen. Wareham is the group's cruise director  —   moderating morning strategy meetings, writing memos, getting everyone to the right room at the right time, handling the press, and sending tweets from the @BanKillerRobots account. This year was the big one. The CCW was going to decide whether to go to the next level, to establish a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) which would then decide whether or not to draft a treaty. If they didn't move forward, the campaign was threatening to take the process “outside” —   to another forum, like the UN Human Rights Council or an   treaty written elsewhere. “Who gets an opportunity to work to try and prevent a disaster from happening before it happens? Because we can all see where this is going,” Wareham told me. “I know that this is a finite campaign  —   the world's going to change, very quickly, very soon, and we need to be ready for that. ” That morning, countries delivered statements on their positions. Algeria and Costa Rica announced their support for a ban. Wareham excitedly added them to what she and other campaigners refer to as “The List,” which includes Pakistan, Egypt, Cuba, Ecuador, Bolivia, Ghana, Palestine, Zimbabwe, and the Holy See  —   countries that probably don't have the technology to develop LAWS to begin with. All eyes were on Russia, which had given a vague statement suggesting they weren't interested. “They always leave us guessing,” Wareham told me when we broke for lunch, reminding me only one country needs to disagree to stall consensus. The cafe outside the assembly room looked out on the UN's verdant grounds. You could see placid Lake Geneva and the Alps in the distance. In the afternoon, country delegates settled into their seats to take notes or doze with their eyes open as experts flashed presentation slides. The two back rows were filled with civil society, many of whom were part of the campaign. During the QA, the representative from China, who is known for being somewhat of an oratorical wildcard, went on a lengthy ramble about artificial intelligence. Midway through, the room erupted in nervous laughter and Erin Hunt, program coordinator from Mines Action Canada, fired off a tweet: “And now the panel was asked if they are smarter than Stephen Hawking. Quite the afternoon at #CCWUN. ” (Over the next five days, Hunt would begin illustrating her tweets with GIFs of eye rolls, prancing puppies, and facepalms.) A few seats away, Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University in the UK, fidgeted waiting for his turn at the microphone. The founder of ICRAC, the International Committee for Robot Arms Control (pronounced  ) plays the part of the campaign's brilliant,   professor. With a bushy long white ponytail, he dresses in all black and is perpetually late or misplacing a crucial item  —   his cell phone or his jacket. In the row over, Jody Williams, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for her work banning landmines, barely suppressed her irritation. Williams is the campaign's straight shooter  —   her favorite story is one in which she grabbed an American colonel around the throat for talking bullshit during a landmine cocktail reception. “If everyone spoke like I do, it would end up having a fist fight,” she said. Even the usually tactful Wareham stopped tweeting. “I didn't want to get too rude or angry. I don't think that helps especially when half the diplomats in that room are following the Twitter account,” she explained later and laughed. But passionate as they all were, could this group of devotees change the course of humanity? Or was this like the campaign against climate change  —   just sit back and watch the water levels rise while shaking your head in dismay? How do you take on a revolution in warfare? Why would any country actually ban a weapon they are convinced can win them a war? And maybe most urgently: With so many things plainly in front of us to be fearful of, how do you convince the world  —   quickly, because these things are already here  —   to be extra afraid of something we can't see for ourselves, all the while knowing that if you fail, machines could kill us all? One of the very real problems with attempting to preemptively ban LAWS is that they kind of already exist. Many countries have defensive systems with autonomous modes that can select and attack targets without human intervention  —   they recognize incoming fire and act to neutralize it. In most cases, humans can override the system, but they are designed for situations where things are happening too quickly for a human to actually veto the machine. The US has the Patriot air defense system to shoot down incoming missiles, aircraft, or drones, as well as the Aegis, the Navy's own   system on the high seas. Members of the campaign told me they do not have a problem with defensive weapons. The issue is offensive systems in part because they may target people  —   but the distinction is murky. For example, there's South Korea's   an autonomous stationary robot set up along the border of the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea that can kill those attempting to flee. The black swiveling box is armed with a 5.  machine gun and   grenade launcher. South Korea says the robot sends the signal back to the operator to fire, so there is a person behind every decision to use force, but there are many reports the robot has an automatic mode. Which mode is on at any given time? Who knows. Meanwhile, offensive systems already exist, too: Take Israel's Harpy and   Harop, which enter an area, hunt for enemy radar, and kamikaze into it, regardless of where they are set up. The Harpy is fully autonomous the Harop has a human on the loop mode. The campaign refers to these as “precursor weapons,” but that distinction is hazy on purpose  —   countries like the US didn't want to risk even mentioning existing technology (drones) so in order to have a conversation at the UN, everything that is already on the ground doesn't count. Militaries want LAWS for a variety of reasons  —   they're cheaper than training personnel. There's the added benefit of force multiplication and projection. Without humans, weapons can be sent to more dangerous areas without considering   casualties. Autonomous target selection allows for faster engagement and the weapon can go where the enemy can jam communications systems. Israel openly intends to move toward full autonomy as quickly as possible. Russia and China have also expressed little interest in a ban. The US is only a little less blunt. In 2012, the Department of Defense issued Directive 3000. 09, which says that LAWS will be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise “appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force. ” What “appropriate” really means, how much judgment, and in which part of the operation, the US has not defined. In January 2015, the DoD announced the Third Offset strategy. Since everyone has nuclear weapons and   precision weapons, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work suggested emphasizing technology was the only way to keep America safe. With the DoD's blessing, the US military is racing ahead. Defense contractor Northrop Grumman's   is the first autonomous     aircraft. Currently in demos, it looks like something from Independence Day: The curved, grey winged pod takes off from a carrier ship, flies a preprogrammed mission, and returns. Last year, the   autonomously refueled in the air. In theory, that means except for maintenance, an   executing missions would never have to land. At an event at the Atlantic Council in May, Work said the US wasn't developing the Terminator. “I think more in terms of Iron Man  —   the ability of a machine to assist a human, where the human is still in control in all matters, but the machine makes the human much more powerful and much more capable,” he said. This is called centaur fighting or human —  machine teaming. Among the lauded new technologies is swarms  —   weapons moving in large formations with one controller somewhere far away on the ground clicking computer keys. Think hundreds of small drones moving as one, like a lethal flock of birds that would put Hitchcock's to shame, or an armada of ships. The weapons communicate with each other to accomplish the mission, in what is called collaborative autonomy. This is already happening  —   two years ago, a small fleet of ships sailed down the James River. In July, the Office of Naval Research tested 30 drones flying together off a small ship at sea that were able to break out of formation, perform a mission, and then regroup. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) which brought us the internet, has long been the epicenter of military innovation, but these days, civilian spheres are the ones making rapid advances. In July, Defense Secretary Ash Carter launched the Defense Innovation   Boston office (DIUx) designed to woo civilian tech companies into collaborating with the DoD. It already has a branch in Silicon Valley. Secretary Carter emphasized DIUx is requesting $72 billion from the budget for research and development for the next year alone promotional materials say the money will be used for handheld drones designed to fly indoors that can operate autonomously and map the environment without needing GPS. They also want   technology that can sift through millions of social media posts for specific images and aggregate those posts for “rapid awareness of extremist activity on the internet. ” (DIUx denied requests for interviews, as did the DoD, the Navy, DARPA, and the Pentagon. The US Air Force, Northrop Grumman, and Boston Dynamics, as well as a bunch of DARPA's subcontracting labs did not respond to emailed interview requests.) Not to be left behind, the UK is developing the Taranis, a supersonic stealth drone like the   except  . China, though a black box of military development, has tested the Sharp Sword, their own stealth combat drone attempting to reach supersonic speeds, and there's word of an    fighter, the Dark Sword, or Anjian, but it is not known how far along in development these are. The Chinese also have showcased pixelated camouflage for tanks, which look like they've come straight out of Minecraft. Russia has the Armata   tank with an unmanned   turret that spins 360 degrees. It currently requires three crew members, but the company has said they are planning to go to zero in the next few years. They also want to build a fully robotized unit with artificial intelligence as soon as possible. Israel is already moving in that direction they developed the Guardium to patrol borders. “Guardium is based on a unique algorithmic expert system that functions as a ‘brain' to allow   capabilities,” Israel's Aerospace Industries declares on its website. All of this is troubling, no matter the country. “I'm worried about the US as a driver  —   not what they are going to do with it, but the perception of what they are doing, and then the perception of other states that they have to keep up,” Heather Roff, a research scientist at Arizona State University and fellow at the New America Foundation, told me. “You couple that perception and you get arms races, and you get bad actors getting their technologies, that they don't give a shit about targeting civilians. ” And it's not just an international threat there is a growing concern about the use of robots in policing and crowd control. In August 2015, North Dakota passed a bill allowing the police to equip their drones with Tasers or rubber bullets. In Texas, a company began exhibiting the CUPID, a fully autonomous quadcopter compliant with the state's Stand Your Ground law  —   if someone illegally enters your property, it will ask them to leave, and if they don't, it can tase them and keep tasing them until the authorities arrive. “People will not worry about this until something really happens,” Sharkey told me. “I have no doubt that there will be autonomous crowd control, if we let it happen. ” But a ban at the CCW would apply only to warfare. Although tear gas is banned from military use, many countries' police, including the US's, use it regularly on their own people. Sharkey was particularly concerned about the sales of a Skunk Riot Control Copter in South Africa. The octacopter can fire 20 bullets per second from four paintball barrels, “stopping any crowd in its tracks,” according to the company website. The Skunk can be armed with pepper spray,   balls, or solid plastic balls, carrying 4, 000 bullets and “blinding lasers. ” It has a thermal camera as well as speakers. Sharkey told me demand is so high he's tracked the opening of two new factories producing the Skunk selling to various security services around the world. With killer robots, you don't have to go occupy physically a state anymore  —   you could aerially occupy it with surveillance. You don't need boots on the ground. I worry that if you did have something like aerial occupation and mass surveillance  —   sensors everywhere, your movements always being tracked, your data always being tracked, everything you say being tracked. That to me seems very  . I don't want to walk into a dystopian future of mass surveillance and authoritarianism. That's what I worry about, mostly, with autonomous technologies, because everyone is going to get so scared. It's more incentives for more surveillance, more monitoring. Overreliance on technology invites interesting ways of adapting to it from an adversary's perspective. So think of IEDs: cheap, lethal,  . No one saw it coming. So I wonder in a situation like this, where you have AIs doing all sorts of different things, systems in the sea, systems in the sky, how do you fight that? I worry it will breed way more terrorist activities. You can call them insurgents, you can call them terrorists, I don't care, when you realize that you can't ever fight the state    anymore, if people are pissed off, they'll find a way to vent that frustration, and they will probably take it out on people who are defenseless. Because that's what we see happening now.  —   Heather Roff, research scientist at Arizona State University, fellow at the New America Foundation and senior research fellow at Oxford, On the second morning of the conference, Wareham and I were walking into the building when she mentioned an Israeli Harop hit a bus full of Armenians in   a mountainous region that has been contested between Azerbaijan and Armenia. According to experts, Israel has sold the kamikaze   drone to at least five countries. “We're not saying it's a killer robot,” Wareham made sure to say, but since it is a system that has an autonomous mode that normally targets radars, how did it hit a bus? What mode was it on? Could it be reverse engineered to look for targets other than radars? Nobody was sure. When Wareham heard about the attack the night before, she started to think about how to document it. “Then I thought, Fuck, man, I'm putting on my   hat. This is not good,” she told me. “The   is when you can explain what happened and document the harm. ” One of the problems with lobbying for preemptively banning a weapon was that there were no casualties for the campaign to point to, to spur public action. The successful Ban Landmines and Ban Cluster Munitions campaigns Wareham had worked on previously hosted many events to bring attention to victims, including building a pyramid of shoes in front of the UN and erecting the Broken Chair, an almost    sculpture of a chair missing a leg that still stands there today. “So you guys have your first victims?” I asked. “I don't know  …    ” She trailed off. “I think because we are so nervous about getting the process going, and they are so nervous about existing systems, that we've been  …     but now we will start to get a lot done and start pointing out the contradictions like that. But if you start off like that you can't get anywhere. ” And indeed, getting this far was hard enough  —   it took almost a decade for the world to take killer robots seriously. Back in 2007, Sharkey was at a press conference when a journalist asked him about military robots. He didn't know anything about them. Sharkey thought he'd have a quick look online one night and stayed transfixed for half a year reading military road maps. He learned the US wanted to build   killer robots and imbue them with AI. “I was shocked and horrified,” he told me. In his first editorial on the subject in The Guardian, he wrote: “A robot could not pinpoint a weapon without pinpointing the person using it or even discriminate between weapons and  . I can imagine a little girl being zapped because she points her ice cream at a robot to share. ” He began speaking publicly, but little happened. Two years later, Sharkey launched ICRAC along with two other academics. They made public speeches, gave presentations, and wrote  . Nothing happened. “We could not have the international discussion going at all,” Sharkey told me. It was a fringe group of nutty professors. In 2010, Williams, the Nobel laureate, was researching extrajudicial execution when she read experts saying that drones were the Ford Model T of where weapons were going. She stumbled into her kitchen where her husband, Stephen Goose, the arms director of Human Rights Watch (HRW) was sitting. “When I learned about killer robots it's like, what the fuck are human beings thinking?” she told me. Goose is Wareham's boss. He met Williams while she was working with Wareham on banning landmines, and the two subsequently got together. They began informal talks on starting a new coalition. Wareham began reaching out to experts and other NGOs. By 2012, a handful of civil society groups had woken up to the problem ICRAC had been talking about. Everyone was watching the impact of armed drones, but their progeny would be much more terrifying. Wareham went to Sheffield to meet Sharkey at home. They spent four hours talking. Wareham wanted to find out more about ICRAC and let them know HRW was planning to campaign against fully autonomous weapons. HRW started working on a report with Harvard Law School's International Human Rights Clinic called “Losing Humanity: The Case Against Killer Robots. ” In order to deal with the seeming contradiction of banning weapons that don't yet exist but kind of do  —   or the issue where humans can in theory override the machine but the system is operating at such high speeds and in such complex ways that it's pretty much impossible for that to have any value  —   the report came up with a concept called “meaningful human control,” in which humans would have ultimate authority over the critical functions of weapons, which includes selection and engagement of targets. What “meaningful” means is still nebulous, but for the campaign, that would at least satisfy the issue of an accountability gap  —   that someone could be tried and punished for war crimes, because there would be a chain of command. In April 2013, the campaign officially launched in London. Taking care to say they appreciate technology, they brought a friendly robot to Parliament Square who handed out bumper stickers to tourists and the media: STOP KILLER ROBOTS in black text, white background, STOP in red, and a bull' . But when they went public, plenty of people, including myself, laughed  —   they seemed insane. Wareham remembers the first NY Times story to quote them: “I was squished in the article between the tea party and Code Pink. It was like they were like, let's interview all of the radical people, and I was just kind of like, OK, you can put us there if you want. ” Comments like this are Wareham's speciality. She is full of positive energy, frenetically competent, always juggling 100 tasks. Things sometimes drop out of her hands  —   the strap of her overstuffed backpack slips, coffee vending machines malfunction in her presence (“Trust the machine!” she joked to me) bits of her sandwich fall out, and she interrupts a conversation to scramble for napkins to clean up. At the 2013 CCW meeting, putting LAWS on the agenda for the following year went to a vote. “That was ” Sharkey remembered. The docket could have been vetoed by any of the countries. Sharkey, who had never been part of a campaign and had never done any activism, was impressed. “Once those NGOs got into the bed with us, we were away,” he told me. Even the camaraderie of fellow activists was a boon. “There were times when I was blackly depressed, to be honest,” he told me. He had been on the road for years talking about killer robots, but talking, always talking, and feeling like he was banging his head against a wall, hearing the same things tossed back at him. “I can be talking to some kind of event in London and some person would say, ‘Well, it's just an unfortunate fact of war, children have always been victims of war and always will be.' And you think, Did you actually just say that, so glibly?“ The CCW first met to discuss LAWS in 2014. By many accounts, it was a circus. Delegates debated whether LAWS already exist, whether they will ever exist, and what they even were. (At this year's conference not much seemed to have changed, if you ask me, but I was assured it had.) The following year, more than a thousand AI researchers, including Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Noam Chomsky signed an open letter calling for a ban. “Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is  —   practically if not legally  —   feasible within years, not decades, and the stakes are high: Autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms,” the letter said. “If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable. ” Wareham was delighted when she heard. She had never been to Silicon Valley. “You know that the movement is starting to take off when people start doing these things that you didn't know about,” she told me. “You're here at a moment in time  —   a snapshot  —   be excited! Be negative, too!” But it didn't seem so simple to me  —   once countries began developing LAWS, which they already have, what would really stop them from continuing? Especially if they perceived adversaries as doing the same. What terrified me most was that while we were talking about banning unicorns  —   something far away and magical that we have all the time in the world to debate  —   the technology kept careening. It had killed seven people that morning. If you had talked to me 10 years ago, I would say that's all science fiction, but I know better now. Take the US launching weapons like the   in big swarms at China. Add China's  . These are moving at supersonic speeds. It is an incontrovertible fact that when we have two programs and we don't know the content of them and they are competing against each other, no one knows what can happen. Sending a swarm of robots against China is one idea to imagine that China is not going to be doing the same, that's crazy. They are going to be sending them to California. If you want to be really scary, you can imagine people putting a nuclear deterrent on an unmanned system. It can go completely ballistic, I mean, who knows what can happen. That's the real danger. Accidental warfare has started before we even knew it started and a lot of people are lying dead. Yes, I do get nightmares about it. Really. ”  —   Noel Sharkey, founder of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control, The next day, Wareham and I were sitting outside of the auditorium assessing the current state of the conference. Mexico had come out in favor of a ban, bringing the total up to 12 countries. Wareham added them to The List. But between the UK saying they were interested in “intelligent partnership” and China volleying between citing the limits of AI telling the difference between “baby boys and baby girls” and also suggesting AI would save humanity, all while the Russian delegation smugly stalled on the need for definitions and the US suggested that autonomy in weapons would reduce civilian casualties, I was even more convinced the CCW was among the most ridiculous things I'd ever seen. The only thing keeping me tethered to sanity seemed to be Instagramming photos of the peacocks that freely roam the UN grounds. The head of the US delegation, Michael Meier, walked by us. “He walked out flashing a [Stop] Killer Robot sticker,” Wareham told me. I was dumbfounded. “Yeah, he's a nice guy, you know. ” Wareham was   when another member of the US delegation cut her off. “Hey, how are you?” the Defense Department representative asked awkwardly, in that way that officials often resemble actual robots. “I was hoping I could get a sticker?” “Oh, are they all gone?” Wareham asked. “They're on the table in there. ” Wareham turned back to me and started laughing. “You're giving out killer robot stickers and that's the Department of Defense representative saying, ‘I really want a sticker. '” She explained how the representative from Germany got them for his five teenagers, who slapped them on their doors as a kind of “Keep Out” sign. Another diplomat kept them on her office desk to show people. “That's honestly part of the reason why we did this, to get attention, to have a conversation starter,” Wareham said. No matter how many times Wareham patiently talked me through it, I still couldn't see how anything they were doing at the CCW would amount to anything. But members of the campaign believe, really seem to believe, in the power of advocacy in a way that feels like a distant memory of a better time  —   a time before September 11, before Guantánamo, before Snowden, before global jihad made any US foreign policy decision domestically publicly acceptable  —   something Wareham readily admits. Growing up at the tail end of the Cold War, anything seemed possible. Wareham remembers being on the streets of Wellington protesting nuclear weapons when she was 11. She and her friends would go downtown after class without telling their parents, joining massive marches against nuclear testing in French Polynesia and against US nuclear warships docking in New Zealand. In 1987, New Zealand passed national legislation that made the country a   zone. The US responded by cutting military ties, but the   status the US threatened never happened. “That's my background of activism  —   that it is possible to take a principled stance,” Wareham told me. “I thought that's the way the world worked. ” By the time Wareham was in university, the Berlin Wall was falling, there was Perestroika, and where there had been East and West Germany, there was now just Germany. Her textbooks could barely keep up with the pace of change. Wareham wrote her thesis on landmines. She joined the Ban Landmines campaign under the tutorship of Jody Williams. For her part, Williams won a Nobel Prize for her faith in the power of activism. When attempts to ban the use of landmines failed at the CCW, the Canadian government took up the cause and invited countries to Ottawa in December 1997 to sign a treaty opting in to ban the weapons 162 states are party to the treaty  —   the US, Russia, Israel, India, Pakistan, and China are not. By 2007, Williams and Wareham were working on the Ban Cluster Munitions campaign. The CCW failed again and they took the treaty process outside, this time to Oslo. They admit the campaigns have not eradicated either weapon, but they argue they have drastically have reduced their use and established an international norm. Yet something about LAWS feels different to me, somehow inevitable. “Nothing is inevitable, it is always a choice,” Williams told me. “We either choose to allow this to happen or we fight it. My choice is to fight it. I think we may not succeed but it's not inevitable. That's very different. ” For all their optimism, the campaigners are strategic, too. There are common tactics to every disarmament movement  —   a recipe that includes a champion country, victims, and a lot of team players. But two days into the meeting, there was no leader yet among the countries that called for a ban. “They're mostly developing countries and the Holy See,” Wareham told me. “What we need is a Western country. ” But none had heeded the call in fact, they seemed to be firmly against it. Wareham didn't seem deterred. She was enthusiastic about Mexico. “Mexico is the country that you want on your team when you are trying to create something, because they have been successfully involved in the creation of most of the humanitarian disarmament treaties that have come out of the last 20 years,” Wareham said. “They're a good team player. ” She gave part of the credit for Mexico's stance to Camilo Serna, a dapper campaigner from Seguridad Humana en América Latina y el Caribe in Colombia, who swirled around the hall, speaking with a different delegate each time I saw him. “As a campaign only, we are like a catalyst,” he told me. “Latin America is very progressive in disarmament. ” But for Wareham, it was his work that was helping push countries to communicate with their capitals, talking    and gaining the confidence of the diplomats to talk things through. “If we can build rapport and if they feel like they can talk to us, then maybe they will go back home and make the extra effort,” she said. Diplomats are people too. Another campaign tactic. Last year, Wareham brought a campaigner from the Middle East and North Africa, who she credits with bringing Egypt and Algeria on board. She couldn't afford to sponsor his trip this year. “We've got a big network of friends who want to help us with this, but what we lack is money,” Wareham told me. “There's so much stuff that we could be doing but we're not. But I keep saying to some governments, this thing is only going to get bigger the longer you take. ” The more time I spent at the CCW, the more concerned I became that regardless of the outcome of the meeting, it would be too late. The GGE would take another year or two. Even in the most ideal setting, treaty drafting would take another year. Then where would we be? I wasn't wrong. “We need to be quite concerned about the developments on the ground just outpacing what is happening at CCW to the point where it becomes an academic discussion, because it will become very hard to unwind once countries start committing large parts of their defense posture to the autonomous weapons,” Russell told me. While the campaign was talking about fully autonomous weapons, human —  machine teaming like the kind Work talked about was coming our way. If you combine facial recognition with targeted strikes, that would be   because the human does the targeting. “You can say it's morally inappropriate for other reasons but for the killer robot campaign, it's not autonomous,” Roff told me. “Now you see where the definitions get really fucked up. ” Roff explained it wouldn't take much to deploy loitering munitions with facial recognition. “We can do that now,” she said, all that was required was to be able to tap into sensor technology that could accurately see faces. “It's more a communication    link, cameras, surveillance, sensor fusion problem, which we are working on. ” “How much does that fall under the scope of whatever the campaign is even talking about?” I asked. “I don't think they know,” Roff told me. “Does the trigger have to be pulled and the bullet fired by the human? Or can the human make a series of selections that can be years, months, days ahead of time and then this thing goes and prosecutes, right? If that's true, then that type of configuration falls outside of the campaign. I think there is a big grey area that the campaign doesn't address. ” Think about that again: One of the things we may not even be talking about banning is a system that has been targeted to hunt a human for days, months, years  —   the situation on the ground can change, the tempo of war can change, a bridge that was once filled with tanks can be crammed with civilians in cars, and the weapon is still out there. This is what the campaign is referencing in the phrase “meaningful human control,” but there's no official definition. That's another campaign tactic: Make countries define things themselves. But why would any country define itself out of a weapon they think will change their national security calculation? The US is among the countries that have suggested they will be able to safely develop these weapons because they will undergo intensive review processes to ensure they comply with international law. For his part, Paul Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security and   of US Directive 3000. 09 back when he was at the DoD, doesn't see the utility in debating a blanket preemptive ban. Scharre talks with the ease of a politician stumping and with   brown hair and a neatly trimmed beard, he almost looks the part. But when I sat down with him in the cafe outside the assembly room, even he had reservations on how all of this could work  —   including the campaign's idea of meaningful human control or his  's own appropriate human judgment. He ran me through a seemingly    example: Let's say we had a weapon that would target Osama bin Laden: The human operator sees bin Laden and he runs around a building, and you let the weapon go, like an attack dog  —   then you'd say the human was still in control. Take it a step back and say bin Laden runs into a building, and you tell the weapon to go into the building, but you don't know what's inside. What if he runs in and grabs a human shield? How big will the explosion be? What if someone else gets injured? Take it another step back: What if you know he's in the city and you tell the weapon to hunt him in the city? “It's not clear where this line is, right? ,” Scharre said. “At some point, I'm crossing some threshold where the person doesn't really know the specific context for the attack. Where it's kind of weird to say that the person's meaningfully involved, like they've just set up this process and then they went and got a sandwich, right? That line is really murky. ” This is the conversation Scharre wants countries to be having on an international level. “There's basically zero chance the CCW will pass a legally binding ban on autonomous weapons because every single state has to agree. It won't,” Scharre told me. But then what was the point? “In this world we are in, drones are proliferating like mad and we're seeing more autonomy baked into things like cars and house robots and everything else and you start to ask, how much autonomy do we want? I think it's worth countries coming together to, like, discuss it in an international context and try to see: Can we reach a common understanding of what right looks like?” So what does right look like? Even if humans can override the system to stop an attack, how likely is it that they will? It's well known that humans begin to defer to the machine it's called automation bias. Like when the squiggly red line appears under a word you type, even though you're pretty sure you're right about how it's spelled, you start to doubt yourself. You have faith in your spam filter, you stop checking it. “You just come to trust it. And if it goes wrong, it goes really wrong,” Sharkey told me. “Machines don't go wrong like humans do they go completely wrong. ” As the complexity of a system increases, it becomes harder to test its behavior in all possible conditions. As code grows, so do the number of elements that can malfunction or be coded incorrectly. With autonomous weapons, how do you even begin to know all of the possible things that can happen during the fog of war? How will these weapons ever actually be completely predictable to operate within the rules of armed conflict? When it comes to artificial intelligence and deep learning, testing has shown that neural networks misclassify images to a degree that makes no sense to humans. Relying on technology to identify enemies on sight could fall victim to the same shortfalls. Even more worrying, humans don't know why machines see these things  —   there's no way to preempt these mistakes. This makes it hard to predict how a system will malfunction or interpret the data humans feed it. What's worse, Scharre explained, in the case of an error, things could go badly wrong in multiple parts of the system as they interact with each other. Even with a human on the loop, the more complicated the system, the less likely the human will know where exactly the error is occurring. The longer the delay between the system malfunction and when the human figures out how to correct it, the more damage it can do. Then there is the potential for hacking or spoofing, which could send a weapons system back on itself. “You might think that you have strategic superiority and that could change in basically 30 seconds because someone has a software upgrade on their side,” Russell said. “Or perhaps someone hacked into your software and figured out what algorithms you are running and the area you will make a move in is predictable. ” The more technology changed, the more concerned even the campaign became. “It's the most important thing I ever worked on,” Sharkey told me. “I am more concerned than when I was at the start because there are so many new technologies that we cannot even predict. We are going to be here all the time getting bans on new things. ” At the end of the conference, Wareham and I were walking out through the UN grounds, a sea of flags fluttered in the wind  —   an idyllic setting to contrast the grim visions of our imminent future. The day before, Nicaragua and Chile had come on board, bringing the total number of countries calling for a ban to 14. After some furtive diplomatic stalling, the CCW decided to move into the next phase, the GGE, which would then decide if they were going to write a treaty, but the mandate was weak. On the sidelines, the campaigners had heard broad support for two years of GGE talks spanning six weeks. Wareham wasn't ecstatic, but she wasn't giving up on the CCW either. “Ultimately this is the process that we have got right now, so we have to stick with it,” she decided. “But if they can't agree to kind of step it up to the next level after this and begin negotiating, that's where we are going to have problems. ” We walked through the building's gleaming ornate white archways and through the lush green manicured entryway. In front of us, the Broken Chair statue loomed. I was still completely unconvinced anything I'd witnessed would mark the beginning of the end of a nightmare that has already started  —   between centaur fighting, autonomous weapons, lack of coherent definitions, attitudes of governments, and the CCW's meager rate of progress, what were the campaign's odds of saving the world from itself? The technology was already there, so was the will to use it, and every month brought new innovations that could never be rolled back. I asked Wareham what the campaign would do next. “What I have to do is to bring the robots to the UN,” she told me about the next big meeting in December, where countries will formally agree to move into the GGE and agree to the timeline for discussions. “We would probably do something cool with the future victims. We can have some shadows or something representing what might come or, you know? I am not sure. We will figure it out. ” Always thinking, always optimistic, Wareham was already onto the next task. “You have to have the visual element, the creative element, the diplomatic engagement, the research, the hard people like Jody [Williams] the soft people like Stephen [Goose] in a suit. It's a symbol  —   the whole cast of characters and get the ingredients right, get the timing right, build the confidence of the diplomats, make them think that you have got a massive movement behind you and get ready basically. Then everybody says go! And we negotiate and then we're done, like, 18 months later! Seriously, this is all just lining everything up for that time when everybody is ready!” Wareham turned to me and laughed. ●  ",False,"'Killer Robots By Air      ' '      And By Sea And By Land' 'CUPID'] A very, very small quadcopter, one inch in diameter can carry a   or   shaped charge. You can order them from a drone manufacturer in China. You can program the code to say: Here are thousands of photographs of the kinds of things I want to target.  A   shaped charge can punch a hole in nine millimeters of steel, so presumably you can also punch a hole in someone's head. You can fit about three million of those in a   . You can drive up   with three trucks and have 10 million weapons attacking NY City. They don't have to be very effective, only 5 or 10% of them have to find the target. There will be manufacturers producing millions of these weapons that people will be able to buy just like you can buy guns now, except millions of guns don't matter unless you have a million soldiers. You need only three guys to write the program and launch them. So you can just imagine that in many parts of the world humans will be hunted. They will be cowering underground in shelters and devising techniques so that they don't get detected. This is the   cloud of lethal autonomous weapons. They could be here in two to three years.     Stuart Russell, professor of computer science and engineering at the University of California Berkeley, Mary Wareham laughs a lot. It usually sounds the same regardless of the circumstance     like a mirthful giggle the blonde New Zealander can't suppress     but it bubbles up at the most varied moments. Wareham laughs when things are funny, she laughs when things are awkward, she laughs when she disagrees with you. And she laughs when things are truly unpleasant, like when you're talking to her about how humanity might soon be annihilated by killer robots and the world is doing nothing to stop it. One afternoon this spring at the United Nations in Geneva, I sat behind Wareham in a large     assembly room that hosted the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) a group of 121 countries that have signed the agreement to restrict weapons that are considered to cause unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to combatants or to affect civilians indiscriminately    in other words, weapons humanity deems too cruel to use in war. The UN moves at a glacial pace, but the CCW is even worse. There's no vote at the end of meetings instead, every contracting party needs to agree in order to get anything done. (Its last and only successful prohibitive weapons ban was in 1995.) It was the start of five days of meetings to discuss lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS): weapons that have the ability to independently select and engage targets, i. e. machines that can make the decision to kill humans, i. e. killer robots. The world slept through the advent of drone attacks. When it came to LAWS would we do the same? Yet it's important to get one thing clear: This isn't a conversation about drones. By now, drone warfare has been normalized     at least 10 countries have them.   cars are tested in fleets. Twenty years ago, a computer beat Garry Kasparov at chess and, more recently, another taught itself how to beat humans at Go, a Chinese game of strategy that doesn't rely as much on patterns and probability. In July, the Dallas police department sent a robot strapped with explosives to kill an active shooter following an attack on police officers during a protest. But with LAWS, unlike the Dallas robot, the human sets the parameters of the attack without actually knowing the specific target. The weapon goes out, looks for anything within those parameters, hones in, and detonates. Examples that don't sound entirely     are things like all enemy ships in the South China Sea, all military radars in X country, all enemy tanks on the plains of Europe. But scale it up, add   actors, and you can envision strange permutations: all power stations, all schools, all hospitals, all   males carrying weapons, all   males wearing baseball caps, those with brown hair. Use your imagination. While this sounds like the kind of horror you pay to see in theaters, killer robots will shortly be arriving at your front door for free courtesy of Russia, China, or the US, all of which are racing to develop them. There are really no technological breakthroughs that are required, Russell, the computer science professor, told me. Every one of the component technology is available in some form commercially        It's really a matter of just how much resources are invested in it.  LAWS are generally broken down into three categories. Most simply, there's humans in the loop     where the machine performs the task under human supervision, arriving at the target and waiting for permission to fire. Humans on the loop     where the machine gets to the place and takes out the target, but the human can override the system. And then, humans out of the loop     where the human releases the machine to perform a task and that's it     no supervision, no recall, no stop function. The debate happening at the UN is which of these to preemptively ban, if any at all. Wareham, the advocacy director of the Human Rights Watch arms division, is the coordinator of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, a coalition of 61 international NGOs, 12 of which had sent delegations to the CCW. Unlike drones, which entered the battlefield as surveillance technology and were weaponized later, the campaign is trying to ban LAWS before they happen. Wareham is the group's cruise director     moderating morning strategy meetings, writing memos, getting everyone to the right room at the right time, handling the press, and sending tweets from the @BanKillerRobots account. This year was the big one. The CCW was going to decide whether to go to the next level, to establish a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) which would then decide whether or not to draft a treaty. If they didn't move forward, the campaign was threatening to take the process outside    to another forum, like the UN Human Rights Council or an   treaty written elsewhere. Who gets an opportunity to work to try and prevent a disaster from happening before it happens? Because we can all see where this is going, Wareham told me. I know that this is a finite campaign     the world's going to change, very quickly, very soon, and we need to be ready for that.  That morning, countries delivered statements on their positions. Algeria and Costa Rica announced their support for a ban. Wareham excitedly added them to what she and other campaigners refer to as The List, which includes Pakistan, Egypt, Cuba, Ecuador, Bolivia, Ghana, Palestine, Zimbabwe, and the Holy See     countries that probably don't have the technology to develop LAWS to begin with. All eyes were on Russia, which had given a vague statement suggesting they weren't interested. They always leave us guessing, Wareham told me when we broke for lunch, reminding me only one country needs to disagree to stall consensus. The cafe outside the assembly room looked out on the UN's verdant grounds. You could see placid Lake Geneva and the Alps in the distance. In the afternoon, country delegates settled into their seats to take notes or doze with their eyes open as experts flashed presentation slides. The two back rows were filled with civil society, many of whom were part of the campaign. During the QA, the representative from China, who is known for being somewhat of an oratorical wildcard, went on a lengthy ramble about artificial intelligence. Midway through, the room erupted in nervous laughter and Erin Hunt, program coordinator from Mines Action Canada, fired off a tweet: And now the panel was asked if they are smarter than Stephen Hawking. Quite the afternoon at #CCWUN.  (Over the next five days, Hunt would begin illustrating her tweets with GIFs of eye rolls, prancing puppies, and facepalms.) A few seats away, Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University in the UK, fidgeted waiting for his turn at the microphone. The founder of ICRAC, the International Committee for Robot Arms Control (pronounced  ) plays the part of the campaign's brilliant,   professor. With a bushy long white ponytail, he dresses in all black and is perpetually late or misplacing a crucial item     his cell phone or his jacket. In the row over, Jody Williams, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for her work banning landmines, barely suppressed her irritation. Williams is the campaign's straight shooter     her favorite story is one in which she grabbed an American colonel around the throat for talking bullshit during a landmine cocktail reception. If everyone spoke like I do, it would end up having a fist fight, she said. Even the usually tactful Wareham stopped tweeting. I didn't want to get too rude or angry. I don't think that helps especially when half the diplomats in that room are following the Twitter account, she explained later and laughed. But passionate as they all were, could this group of devotees change the course of humanity? Or was this like the campaign against climate change     just sit back and watch the water levels rise while shaking your head in dismay? How do you take on a revolution in warfare? Why would any country actually ban a weapon they are convinced can win them a war? And maybe most urgently: With so many things plainly in front of us to be fearful of, how do you convince the world     quickly, because these things are already here     to be extra afraid of something we can't see for ourselves, all the while knowing that if you fail, machines could kill us all? One of the very real problems with attempting to preemptively ban LAWS is that they kind of already exist. Many countries have defensive systems with autonomous modes that can select and attack targets without human intervention     they recognize incoming fire and act to neutralize it. In most cases, humans can override the system, but they are designed for situations where things are happening too quickly for a human to actually veto the machine. The US has the Patriot air defense system to shoot down incoming missiles, aircraft, or drones, as well as the Aegis, the Navy's own   system on the high seas. Members of the campaign told me they do not have a problem with defensive weapons. The issue is offensive systems in part because they may target people     but the distinction is murky. For example, there's South Korea's   an autonomous stationary robot set up along the border of the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea that can kill those attempting to flee. The black swiveling box is armed with a 5.  machine gun and   grenade launcher. South Korea says the robot sends the signal back to the operator to fire, so there is a person behind every decision to use force, but there are many reports the robot has an automatic mode. Which mode is on at any given time? Who knows. Meanwhile, offensive systems already exist, too: Take Israel's Harpy and   Harop, which enter an area, hunt for enemy radar, and kamikaze into it, regardless of where they are set up. The Harpy is fully autonomous the Harop has a human on the loop mode. The campaign refers to these as precursor weapons, but that distinction is hazy on purpose     countries like the US didn't want to risk even mentioning existing technology (drones) so in order to have a conversation at the UN, everything that is already on the ground doesn't count. Militaries want LAWS for a variety of reasons     they're cheaper than training personnel. There's the added benefit of force multiplication and projection. Without humans, weapons can be sent to more dangerous areas without considering   casualties. Autonomous target selection allows for faster engagement and the weapon can go where the enemy can jam communications systems. Israel openly intends to move toward full autonomy as quickly as possible. Russia and China have also expressed little interest in a ban. The US is only a little less blunt. In 2012, the Department of Defense issued Directive 3000. 09, which says that LAWS will be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force.  What appropriate really means, how much judgment, and in which part of the operation, the US has not defined. In January 2015, the DoD announced the Third Offset strategy. Since everyone has nuclear weapons and   precision weapons, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work suggested emphasizing technology was the only way to keep America safe. With the DoD's blessing, the US military is racing ahead. Defense contractor Northrop Grumman's   is the first autonomous     aircraft. Currently in demos, it looks like something from Independence Day: The curved, grey winged pod takes off from a carrier ship, flies a preprogrammed mission, and returns. Last year, the   autonomously refueled in the air. In theory, that means except for maintenance, an   executing missions would never have to land. At an event at the Atlantic Council in May, Work said the US wasn't developing the Terminator. I think more in terms of Iron Man     the ability of a machine to assist a human, where the human is still in control in all matters, but the machine makes the human much more powerful and much more capable, he said. This is called centaur fighting or human   machine teaming. Among the lauded new technologies is swarms     weapons moving in large formations with one controller somewhere far away on the ground clicking computer keys. Think hundreds of small drones moving as one, like a lethal flock of birds that would put Hitchcock's to shame, or an armada of ships. The weapons communicate with each other to accomplish the mission, in what is called collaborative autonomy. This is already happening     two years ago, a small fleet of ships sailed down the James River. In July, the Office of Naval Research tested 30 drones flying together off a small ship at sea that were able to break out of formation, perform a mission, and then regroup. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) which brought us the internet, has long been the epicenter of military innovation, but these days, civilian spheres are the ones making rapid advances. In July, Defense Secretary Ash Carter launched the Defense Innovation   Boston office (DIUx) designed to woo civilian tech companies into collaborating with the DoD. It already has a branch in Silicon Valley. Secretary Carter emphasized DIUx is requesting $72 billion from the budget for research and development for the next year alone promotional materials say the money will be used for handheld drones designed to fly indoors that can operate autonomously and map the environment without needing GPS. They also want   technology that can sift through millions of social media posts for specific images and aggregate those posts for rapid awareness of extremist activity on the internet.  (DIUx denied requests for interviews, as did the DoD, the Navy, DARPA, and the Pentagon. The US Air Force, Northrop Grumman, and Boston Dynamics, as well as a bunch of DARPA's subcontracting labs did not respond to emailed interview requests.) Not to be left behind, the UK is developing the Taranis, a supersonic stealth drone like the   except  . China, though a black box of military development, has tested the Sharp Sword, their own stealth combat drone attempting to reach supersonic speeds, and there's word of an    fighter, the Dark Sword, or Anjian, but it is not known how far along in development these are. The Chinese also have showcased pixelated camouflage for tanks, which look like they've come straight out of Minecraft. Russia has the Armata   tank with an unmanned   turret that spins 360 degrees. It currently requires three crew members, but the company has said they are planning to go to zero in the next few years. They also want to build a fully robotized unit with artificial intelligence as soon as possible. Israel is already moving in that direction they developed the Guardium to patrol borders. Guardium is based on a unique algorithmic expert system that functions as a brain' to allow   capabilities, Israel's Aerospace Industries declares on its website. All of this is troubling, no matter the country. I'm worried about the US as a driver     not what they are going to do with it, but the perception of what they are doing, and then the perception of other states that they have to keep up, Heather Roff, a research scientist at Arizona State University and fellow at the New America Foundation, told me. You couple that perception and you get arms races, and you get bad actors getting their technologies, that they don't give a shit about targeting civilians.  And it's not just an international threat there is a growing concern about the use of robots in policing and crowd control. In August 2015, North Dakota passed a bill allowing the police to equip their drones with Tasers or rubber bullets. In Texas, a company began exhibiting the CUPID, a fully autonomous quadcopter compliant with the state's Stand Your Ground law     if someone illegally enters your property, it will ask them to leave, and if they don't, it can tase them and keep tasing them until the authorities arrive. People will not worry about this until something really happens, Sharkey told me. I have no doubt that there will be autonomous crowd control, if we let it happen.  But a ban at the CCW would apply only to warfare. Although tear gas is banned from military use, many countries' police, including the US's, use it regularly on their own people. Sharkey was particularly concerned about the sales of a Skunk Riot Control Copter in South Africa. The octacopter can fire 20 bullets per second from four paintball barrels, stopping any crowd in its tracks, according to the company website. The Skunk can be armed with pepper spray,   balls, or solid plastic balls, carrying 4, 000 bullets and blinding lasers.  It has a thermal camera as well as speakers. Sharkey told me demand is so high he's tracked the opening of two new factories producing the Skunk selling to various security services around the world. With killer robots, you don't have to go occupy physically a state anymore     you could aerially occupy it with surveillance. You don't need boots on the ground. I worry that if you did have something like aerial occupation and mass surveillance     sensors everywhere, your movements always being tracked, your data always being tracked, everything you say being tracked. That to me seems very  . I don't want to walk into a dystopian future of mass surveillance and authoritarianism. That's what I worry about, mostly, with autonomous technologies, because everyone is going to get so scared. It's more incentives for more surveillance, more monitoring. Overreliance on technology invites interesting ways of adapting to it from an adversary's perspective. So think of IEDs: cheap, lethal,  . No one saw it coming. So I wonder in a situation like this, where you have AIs doing all sorts of different things, systems in the sea, systems in the sky, how do you fight that? I worry it will breed way more terrorist activities. You can call them insurgents, you can call them terrorists, I don't care, when you realize that you can't ever fight the state    anymore, if people are pissed off, they'll find a way to vent that frustration, and they will probably take it out on people who are defenseless. Because that's what we see happening now.     Heather Roff, research scientist at Arizona State University, fellow at the New America Foundation and senior research fellow at Oxford, On the second morning of the conference, Wareham and I were walking into the building when she mentioned an Israeli Harop hit a bus full of Armenians in   a mountainous region that has been contested between Azerbaijan and Armenia. According to experts, Israel has sold the kamikaze   drone to at least five countries. We're not saying it's a killer robot, Wareham made sure to say, but since it is a system that has an autonomous mode that normally targets radars, how did it hit a bus? What mode was it on? Could it be reverse engineered to look for targets other than radars? Nobody was sure. When Wareham heard about the attack the night before, she started to think about how to document it. Then I thought, Fuck, man, I'm putting on my   hat. This is not good, she told me. The   is when you can explain what happened and document the harm.  One of the problems with lobbying for preemptively banning a weapon was that there were no casualties for the campaign to point to, to spur public action. The successful Ban Landmines and Ban Cluster Munitions campaigns Wareham had worked on previously hosted many events to bring attention to victims, including building a pyramid of shoes in front of the UN and erecting the Broken Chair, an almost    sculpture of a chair missing a leg that still stands there today. So you guys have your first victims? I asked. I don't know       She trailed off. I think because we are so nervous about getting the process going, and they are so nervous about existing systems, that we've been       but now we will start to get a lot done and start pointing out the contradictions like that. But if you start off like that you can't get anywhere.  And indeed, getting this far was hard enough     it took almost a decade for the world to take killer robots seriously. Back in 2007, Sharkey was at a press conference when a journalist asked him about military robots. He didn't know anything about them. Sharkey thought he'd have a quick look online one night and stayed transfixed for half a year reading military road maps. He learned the US wanted to build   killer robots and imbue them with AI. I was shocked and horrified, he told me. In his first editorial on the subject in The Guardian, he wrote: A robot could not pinpoint a weapon without pinpointing the person using it or even discriminate between weapons and  . I can imagine a little girl being zapped because she points her ice cream at a robot to share.  He began speaking publicly, but little happened. Two years later, Sharkey launched ICRAC along with two other academics. They made public speeches, gave presentations, and wrote  . Nothing happened. We could not have the international discussion going at all, Sharkey told me. It was a fringe group of nutty professors. In 2010, Williams, the Nobel laureate, was researching extrajudicial execution when she read experts saying that drones were the Ford Model T of where weapons were going. She stumbled into her kitchen where her husband, Stephen Goose, the arms director of Human Rights Watch (HRW) was sitting. When I learned about killer robots it's like, what the fuck are human beings thinking? she told me. Goose is Wareham's boss. He met Williams while she was working with Wareham on banning landmines, and the two subsequently got together. They began informal talks on starting a new coalition. Wareham began reaching out to experts and other NGOs. By 2012, a handful of civil society groups had woken up to the problem ICRAC had been talking about. Everyone was watching the impact of armed drones, but their progeny would be much more terrifying. Wareham went to Sheffield to meet Sharkey at home. They spent four hours talking. Wareham wanted to find out more about ICRAC and let them know HRW was planning to campaign against fully autonomous weapons. HRW started working on a report with Harvard Law School's International Human Rights Clinic called Losing Humanity: The Case Against Killer Robots.  In order to deal with the seeming contradiction of banning weapons that don't yet exist but kind of do     or the issue where humans can in theory override the machine but the system is operating at such high speeds and in such complex ways that it's pretty much impossible for that to have any value     the report came up with a concept called meaningful human control, in which humans would have ultimate authority over the critical functions of weapons, which includes selection and engagement of targets. What meaningful means is still nebulous, but for the campaign, that would at least satisfy the issue of an accountability gap     that someone could be tried and punished for war crimes, because there would be a chain of command. In April 2013, the campaign officially launched in London. Taking care to say they appreciate technology, they brought a friendly robot to Parliament Square who handed out bumper stickers to tourists and the media: STOP KILLER ROBOTS in black text, white background, STOP in red, and a bull' . But when they went public, plenty of people, including myself, laughed     they seemed insane. Wareham remembers the first NY Times story to quote them: I was squished in the article between the tea party and Code Pink. It was like they were like, let's interview all of the radical people, and I was just kind of like, OK, you can put us there if you want.  Comments like this are Wareham's speciality. She is full of positive energy, frenetically competent, always juggling 100 tasks. Things sometimes drop out of her hands     the strap of her overstuffed backpack slips, coffee vending machines malfunction in her presence (Trust the machine! she joked to me) bits of her sandwich fall out, and she interrupts a conversation to scramble for napkins to clean up. At the 2013 CCW meeting, putting LAWS on the agenda for the following year went to a vote. That was  Sharkey remembered. The docket could have been vetoed by any of the countries. Sharkey, who had never been part of a campaign and had never done any activism, was impressed. Once those NGOs got into the bed with us, we were away, he told me. Even the camaraderie of fellow activists was a boon. There were times when I was blackly depressed, to be honest, he told me. He had been on the road for years talking about killer robots, but talking, always talking, and feeling like he was banging his head against a wall, hearing the same things tossed back at him. I can be talking to some kind of event in London and some person would say, Well, it's just an unfortunate fact of war, children have always been victims of war and always will be.' And you think, Did you actually just say that, so glibly? The CCW first met to discuss LAWS in 2014. By many accounts, it was a circus. Delegates debated whether LAWS already exist, whether they will ever exist, and what they even were. (At this year's conference not much seemed to have changed, if you ask me, but I was assured it had.) The following year, more than a thousand AI researchers, including Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Noam Chomsky signed an open letter calling for a ban. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is     practically if not legally     feasible within years, not decades, and the stakes are high: Autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms, the letter said. If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable.  Wareham was delighted when she heard. She had never been to Silicon Valley. You know that the movement is starting to take off when people start doing these things that you didn't know about, she told me. You're here at a moment in time     a snapshot     be excited! Be negative, too! But it didn't seem so simple to me     once countries began developing LAWS, which they already have, what would really stop them from continuing? Especially if they perceived adversaries as doing the same. What terrified me most was that while we were talking about banning unicorns     something far away and magical that we have all the time in the world to debate     the technology kept careening. It had killed seven people that morning. If you had talked to me 10 years ago, I would say that's all science fiction, but I know better now. Take the US launching weapons like the   in big swarms at China. Add China's  . These are moving at supersonic speeds. It is an incontrovertible fact that when we have two programs and we don't know the content of them and they are competing against each other, no one knows what can happen. Sending a swarm of robots against China is one idea to imagine that China is not going to be doing the same, that's crazy. They are going to be sending them to California. If you want to be really scary, you can imagine people putting a nuclear deterrent on an unmanned system. It can go completely ballistic, I mean, who knows what can happen. That's the real danger. Accidental warfare has started before we even knew it started and a lot of people are lying dead. Yes, I do get nightmares about it. Really.      Noel Sharkey, founder of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control, The next day, Wareham and I were sitting outside of the auditorium assessing the current state of the conference. Mexico had come out in favor of a ban, bringing the total up to 12 countries. Wareham added them to The List. But between the UK saying they were interested in intelligent partnership and China volleying between citing the limits of AI telling the difference between baby boys and baby girls and also suggesting AI would save humanity, all while the Russian delegation smugly stalled on the need for definitions and the US suggested that autonomy in weapons would reduce civilian casualties, I was even more convinced the CCW was among the most ridiculous things I'd ever seen. The only thing keeping me tethered to sanity seemed to be Instagramming photos of the peacocks that freely roam the UN grounds. The head of the US delegation, Michael Meier, walked by us. He walked out flashing a [Stop] Killer Robot sticker, Wareham told me. I was dumbfounded. Yeah, he's a nice guy, you know.  Wareham was   when another member of the US delegation cut her off. Hey, how are you? the Defense Department representative asked awkwardly, in that way that officials often resemble actual robots. I was hoping I could get a sticker? Oh, are they all gone? Wareham asked. They're on the table in there.  Wareham turned back to me and started laughing. You're giving out killer robot stickers and that's the Department of Defense representative saying, I really want a sticker. ' She explained how the representative from Germany got them for his five teenagers, who slapped them on their doors as a kind of Keep Out sign. Another diplomat kept them on her office desk to show people. That's honestly part of the reason why we did this, to get attention, to have a conversation starter, Wareham said. No matter how many times Wareham patiently talked me through it, I still couldn't see how anything they were doing at the CCW would amount to anything. But members of the campaign believe, really seem to believe, in the power of advocacy in a way that feels like a distant memory of a better time     a time before September 11, before Guantnamo, before Snowden, before global jihad made any US foreign policy decision domestically publicly acceptable     something Wareham readily admits. Growing up at the tail end of the Cold War, anything seemed possible. Wareham remembers being on the streets of Wellington protesting nuclear weapons when she was 11. She and her friends would go downtown after class without telling their parents, joining massive marches against nuclear testing in French Polynesia and against US nuclear warships docking in New Zealand. In 1987, New Zealand passed national legislation that made the country a   zone. The US responded by cutting military ties, but the   status the US threatened never happened. That's my background of activism     that it is possible to take a principled stance, Wareham told me. I thought that's the way the world worked.  By the time Wareham was in university, the Berlin Wall was falling, there was Perestroika, and where there had been East and West Germany, there was now just Germany. Her textbooks could barely keep up with the pace of change. Wareham wrote her thesis on landmines. She joined the Ban Landmines campaign under the tutorship of Jody Williams. For her part, Williams won a Nobel Prize for her faith in the power of activism. When attempts to ban the use of landmines failed at the CCW, the Canadian government took up the cause and invited countries to Ottawa in December 1997 to sign a treaty opting in to ban the weapons 162 states are party to the treaty     the US, Russia, Israel, India, Pakistan, and China are not. By 2007, Williams and Wareham were working on the Ban Cluster Munitions campaign. The CCW failed again and they took the treaty process outside, this time to Oslo. They admit the campaigns have not eradicated either weapon, but they argue they have drastically have reduced their use and established an international norm. Yet something about LAWS feels different to me, somehow inevitable. Nothing is inevitable, it is always a choice, Williams told me. We either choose to allow this to happen or we fight it. My choice is to fight it. I think we may not succeed but it's not inevitable. That's very different.  For all their optimism, the campaigners are strategic, too. There are common tactics to every disarmament movement     a recipe that includes a champion country, victims, and a lot of team players. But two days into the meeting, there was no leader yet among the countries that called for a ban. They're mostly developing countries and the Holy See, Wareham told me. What we need is a Western country.  But none had heeded the call in fact, they seemed to be firmly against it. Wareham didn't seem deterred. She was enthusiastic about Mexico. Mexico is the country that you want on your team when you are trying to create something, because they have been successfully involved in the creation of most of the humanitarian disarmament treaties that have come out of the last 20 years, Wareham said. They're a good team player.  She gave part of the credit for Mexico's stance to Camilo Serna, a dapper campaigner from Seguridad Humana en Amrica Latina y el Caribe in Colombia, who swirled around the hall, speaking with a different delegate each time I saw him. As a campaign only, we are like a catalyst, he told me. Latin America is very progressive in disarmament.  But for Wareham, it was his work that was helping push countries to communicate with their capitals, talking    and gaining the confidence of the diplomats to talk things through. If we can build rapport and if they feel like they can talk to us, then maybe they will go back home and make the extra effort, she said. Diplomats are people too. Another campaign tactic. Last year, Wareham brought a campaigner from the Middle East and North Africa, who she credits with bringing Egypt and Algeria on board. She couldn't afford to sponsor his trip this year. We've got a big network of friends who want to help us with this, but what we lack is money, Wareham told me. There's so much stuff that we could be doing but we're not. But I keep saying to some governments, this thing is only going to get bigger the longer you take.  The more time I spent at the CCW, the more concerned I became that regardless of the outcome of the meeting, it would be too late. The GGE would take another year or two. Even in the most ideal setting, treaty drafting would take another year. Then where would we be? I wasn't wrong. We need to be quite concerned about the developments on the ground just outpacing what is happening at CCW to the point where it becomes an academic discussion, because it will become very hard to unwind once countries start committing large parts of their defense posture to the autonomous weapons, Russell told me. While the campaign was talking about fully autonomous weapons, human   machine teaming like the kind Work talked about was coming our way. If you combine facial recognition with targeted strikes, that would be   because the human does the targeting. You can say it's morally inappropriate for other reasons but for the killer robot campaign, it's not autonomous, Roff told me. Now you see where the definitions get really fucked up.  Roff explained it wouldn't take much to deploy loitering munitions with facial recognition. We can do that now, she said, all that was required was to be able to tap into sensor technology that could accurately see faces. It's more a communication    link, cameras, surveillance, sensor fusion problem, which we are working on.  How much does that fall under the scope of whatever the campaign is even talking about? I asked. I don't think they know, Roff told me. Does the trigger have to be pulled and the bullet fired by the human? Or can the human make a series of selections that can be years, months, days ahead of time and then this thing goes and prosecutes, right? If that's true, then that type of configuration falls outside of the campaign. I think there is a big grey area that the campaign doesn't address.  Think about that again: One of the things we may not even be talking about banning is a system that has been targeted to hunt a human for days, months, years     the situation on the ground can change, the tempo of war can change, a bridge that was once filled with tanks can be crammed with civilians in cars, and the weapon is still out there. This is what the campaign is referencing in the phrase meaningful human control, but there's no official definition. That's another campaign tactic: Make countries define things themselves. But why would any country define itself out of a weapon they think will change their national security calculation? The US is among the countries that have suggested they will be able to safely develop these weapons because they will undergo intensive review processes to ensure they comply with international law. For his part, Paul Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security and   of US Directive 3000. 09 back when he was at the DoD, doesn't see the utility in debating a blanket preemptive ban. Scharre talks with the ease of a politician stumping and with   brown hair and a neatly trimmed beard, he almost looks the part. But when I sat down with him in the cafe outside the assembly room, even he had reservations on how all of this could work     including the campaign's idea of meaningful human control or his  's own appropriate human judgment. He ran me through a seemingly    example: Let's say we had a weapon that would target Osama bin Laden: The human operator sees bin Laden and he runs around a building, and you let the weapon go, like an attack dog     then you'd say the human was still in control. Take it a step back and say bin Laden runs into a building, and you tell the weapon to go into the building, but you don't know what's inside. What if he runs in and grabs a human shield? How big will the explosion be? What if someone else gets injured? Take it another step back: What if you know he's in the city and you tell the weapon to hunt him in the city? It's not clear where this line is, right? , Scharre said. At some point, I'm crossing some threshold where the person doesn't really know the specific context for the attack. Where it's kind of weird to say that the person's meaningfully involved, like they've just set up this process and then they went and got a sandwich, right? That line is really murky.  This is the conversation Scharre wants countries to be having on an international level. There's basically zero chance the CCW will pass a legally binding ban on autonomous weapons because every single state has to agree. It won't, Scharre told me. But then what was the point? In this world we are in, drones are proliferating like mad and we're seeing more autonomy baked into things like cars and house robots and everything else and you start to ask, how much autonomy do we want? I think it's worth countries coming together to, like, discuss it in an international context and try to see: Can we reach a common understanding of what right looks like? So what does right look like? Even if humans can override the system to stop an attack, how likely is it that they will? It's well known that humans begin to defer to the machine it's called automation bias. Like when the squiggly red line appears under a word you type, even though you're pretty sure you're right about how it's spelled, you start to doubt yourself. You have faith in your spam filter, you stop checking it. You just come to trust it. And if it goes wrong, it goes really wrong, Sharkey told me. Machines don't go wrong like humans do they go completely wrong.  As the complexity of a system increases, it becomes harder to test its behavior in all possible conditions. As code grows, so do the number of elements that can malfunction or be coded incorrectly. With autonomous weapons, how do you even begin to know all of the possible things that can happen during the fog of war? How will these weapons ever actually be completely predictable to operate within the rules of armed conflict? When it comes to artificial intelligence and deep learning, testing has shown that neural networks misclassify images to a degree that makes no sense to humans. Relying on technology to identify enemies on sight could fall victim to the same shortfalls. Even more worrying, humans don't know why machines see these things     there's no way to preempt these mistakes. This makes it hard to predict how a system will malfunction or interpret the data humans feed it. What's worse, Scharre explained, in the case of an error, things could go badly wrong in multiple parts of the system as they interact with each other. Even with a human on the loop, the more complicated the system, the less likely the human will know where exactly the error is occurring. The longer the delay between the system malfunction and when the human figures out how to correct it, the more damage it can do. Then there is the potential for hacking or spoofing, which could send a weapons system back on itself. You might think that you have strategic superiority and that could change in basically 30 seconds because someone has a software upgrade on their side, Russell said. Or perhaps someone hacked into your software and figured out what algorithms you are running and the area you will make a move in is predictable.  The more technology changed, the more concerned even the campaign became. It's the most important thing I ever worked on, Sharkey told me. I am more concerned than when I was at the start because there are so many new technologies that we cannot even predict. We are going to be here all the time getting bans on new things.  At the end of the conference, Wareham and I were walking out through the UN grounds, a sea of flags fluttered in the wind     an idyllic setting to contrast the grim visions of our imminent future. The day before, Nicaragua and Chile had come on board, bringing the total number of countries calling for a ban to 14. After some furtive diplomatic stalling, the CCW decided to move into the next phase, the GGE, which would then decide if they were going to write a treaty, but the mandate was weak. On the sidelines, the campaigners had heard broad support for two years of GGE talks spanning six weeks. Wareham wasn't ecstatic, but she wasn't giving up on the CCW either. Ultimately this is the process that we have got right now, so we have to stick with it, she decided. But if they can't agree to kind of step it up to the next level after this and begin negotiating, that's where we are going to have problems.  We walked through the building's gleaming ornate white archways and through the lush green manicured entryway. In front of us, the Broken Chair statue loomed. I was still completely unconvinced anything I'd witnessed would mark the beginning of the end of a nightmare that has already started     between centaur fighting, autonomous weapons, lack of coherent definitions, attitudes of governments, and the CCW's meager rate of progress, what were the campaign's odds of saving the world from itself? The technology was already there, so was the will to use it, and every month brought new innovations that could never be rolled back. I asked Wareham what the campaign would do next. What I have to do is to bring the robots to the UN, she told me about the next big meeting in December, where countries will formally agree to move into the GGE and agree to the timeline for discussions. We would probably do something cool with the future victims. We can have some shadows or something representing what might come or, you know? I am not sure. We will figure it out.  Always thinking, always optimistic, Wareham was already onto the next task. You have to have the visual element, the creative element, the diplomatic engagement, the research, the hard people like Jody [Williams] the soft people like Stephen [Goose] in a suit. It's a symbol     the whole cast of characters and get the ingredients right, get the timing right, build the confidence of the diplomats, make them think that you have got a massive movement behind you and get ready basically. Then everybody says go! And we negotiate and then we're done, like, 18 months later! Seriously, this is all just lining everything up for that time when everybody is ready! Wareham turned to me and laughed.   "

"," For seven years before the murder, Dee Dee and Gypsy Rose Blancharde lived in a small pink bungalow on West Volunteer Way in Springfield, Missouri. Their neighbors liked them. “'Sweet' is the word I'd use,” a former friend of Dee Dee's told me not too long ago. Once you met them, people said, they were impossible to forget. Dee Dee was 48 years old, originally from Louisiana. She was a large,   person, which she reinforced by dressing in bright, cheerful colors. She had curly brown hair she liked to hold back with ribbons. People who knew her remember her as generous with her time and, when she could be, generous with money. She could make friends quickly and inspire deep devotion. She did not have a job, but instead served as a   caretaker for Gypsy Rose, her teenage daughter. Gypsy was a tiny thing, perhaps 5 feet tall as far as anyone could guess. She was confined to a wheelchair. Her round face was overwhelmed by a pair of owlish glasses. She was pale and skinny, and her teeth were crumbling and painful. She had a feeding tube. Sometimes Dee Dee had to drag an oxygen tank around with them, nasal cannula looped around Gypsy's small ears. Ask about her daughter's diagnoses, and Dee Dee would reel off a list as long as her arm: chromosomal defects, muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, severe asthma, sleep apnea, eye problems. It had always been this way, Dee Dee said, ever since Gypsy was a baby. She had spent time in neonatal intensive care. She had leukemia as a toddler. The endless health crises had taken a toll. Gypsy was friendly, talkative even, but her voice was high and childlike. Dee Dee would often remind people that her daughter had brain damage. She had to be homeschooled, because she'd never be able to keep up with other kids. Gypsy had the mind of a child of 7, Dee Dee said. It was important to remember that in dealing with her. She loved princess outfits and dressing up. She wore wigs and hats to cover her small head. A curly, blonde Cinderella number seems to have been her favorite. She's wearing it in so many photographs of herself with her mother. She was always with her mother. “We are a pair of shoes,” Gypsy once said. “Never good without the other. ” Their house, like everyone else's around them, had been built by Habitat for Humanity. It had amenities specially built for Gypsy: a ramp up to the front door, a Jacuzzi tub to help with “my muscles,” Gypsy told a local television station in 2008. Sometimes, on summer nights, Dee Dee would set up a projector to play a movie on the side of her house and the children of the neighborhood, whose parents usually couldn't afford to send them to a movie theater, came over for a treat. Dee Dee charged for concessions, but it was still cheaper than the local multiplex. The money was to go to Gypsy's treatments. Dee Dee became particularly close with some people across the way, a single mother named Amy Pinegar and her four children. Over years of tea and coffee, Dee Dee would tell Pinegar her life story. She was originally from a small town in Louisiana, she said, but she'd had to flee her abusive family with Gypsy. It was her own father, Gypsy's grandfather, who'd been the last straw he'd burned Gypsy with cigarettes. So she'd lit out from her hometown for good. She told Pinegar that Gypsy's father was a deadbeat, an alcoholic drug abuser who had mocked his daughter's disabilities, called the Special Olympics a “freak show. ” As Pinegar understood it, he'd never sent them a dime, not even when Dee Dee and Gypsy had lost everything in Hurricane Katrina. It was a blessing that a doctor at a rescue shelter had helped them get to the Ozarks. Sometimes, listening, Amy Pinegar found herself overwhelmed. “I wondered,” Pinegar told me over the phone last fall, “keeping this child alive  …     Is she that happy?” All she could do was be a good neighbor and pitch in when she could. She'd drive Dee Dee and Gypsy to the airport for their medical trips to Kansas City, bring them things from Sam's Club. Ultimately, they did seem happy. They went on charity trips to Disney World, met Miranda Lambert through the    Foundation. Looking back on it, Pinegar was sometimes even jealous of them. It was a perfect story for a human interest segment on the evening news: a family living through tragedy and disaster, managing to build a life for themselves in spite of so many obstacles. But the story wasn't over. One day last June, Dee Dee's Facebook account posted an update. “That bitch is dead,” it read. It was June 14, a hot Sunday afternoon that had driven a lot of people indoors to the blessings of  . The first few comments on the status are from friends expressing wild disbelief. Maybe the page had been hacked. Maybe someone should call. Does anyone know where they live? Should someone call the police, give them the address? As they debated it, a new comment from Dee Dee's account appeared on the status: “I fucken SLASHED THAT FAT PIG AND RAPED HER SWEET INNOCENT DAUGHTER  …    HER SCREAM WAS SOOOO FUCKEN LOUD LOL. ” Kim Blanchard, who lived nearby, was among the first to react. Though Kim had a similar last name to the Blanchardes, she wasn't a relative. She had met Dee Dee and Gypsy in 2009 at a science fiction and fantasy convention held in the Ozarks, where Gypsy could wear costumes and not be particularly out of place. “They were just perfect,” Kim said. “Here was this poor, sick child who was being taken care of by a wonderful, patient mother who only wanted to help everybody. ” Kim called Dee Dee's number, but there was no answer. Kim's husband, David, suggested that they drive on over to the house just to make sure everything was all right. When they arrived, a crowd of worried neighbors was already gathering. Dee Dee and Gypsy had sometimes been unreachable before, off on a medical trip without telling anyone. The windows had a protective film on them it was hard to see in. Knocking on the doors brought no response. But everyone found it suspicious that Dee Dee's new cube van, which could easily transport Gypsy around in her wheelchair, was parked in the driveway. Kim called 911. The police couldn't enter the house without a warrant, but didn't stop David from climbing through a window. Inside, he saw nothing amiss. All the lights had been turned off, and the   was on high. There were no signs of a robbery, or any struggle. All of Gypsy's wheelchairs were still in the house. It was frightening to think about how helpless she might be without them. The police began taking statements while they waited for a search warrant. Kim relayed information back to Facebook. Yes, they'd been to the house yes, the police had been called. Dee Dee's online friends and acquaintances began bombarding Kim with questions. She answered as best she could, but the status was beginning to get shared around Missouri. “Here's the thing guys  …    I know everyone is very concerned,” Kim wrote on Facebook. “We need to realize that whoever posted this can read all of this. ” The search warrant didn't come through until 10:45 that night. The police found Dee Dee's body in the bedroom. She'd been stabbed, and had been dead for several days. But there was no sign of Gypsy. The next day, Kim organized a vigil and a GoFundMe account to take care of Dee Dee's funeral expenses  —   and possibly Gypsy's. Everyone feared the worst. All her life, Gypsy had evoked protective responses in people. She was so small and looked so helpless. Many people couldn't understand why this had happened to her. Who could prey on someone who had no defenses? Meanwhile, the police were starting to sort things out. A young woman named Aleah Woodmansee had approached them. There were some things she knew, things that might be helpful. For example, she told them, Gypsy had a secret online boyfriend. Aleah was Amy Pinegar's daughter, a    who'd worked as a medical claims investigator. She felt like a big sister to Gypsy, and evidently Gypsy felt the same. But they were rarely alone together, as Gypsy's mother was constantly by her side. So when Gypsy confided in Aleah, it was through a secret Facebook account, under the name Emma Rose. “This is my personal account my mom is still overprotective so she don't, know about this account,” Gypsy wrote in October 2014. Then she confessed she'd met a man on a Christian singles site. She was in love with him, she told Aleah. Gypsy hadn't yet told her mother. She wrote that she knew Dee Dee wouldn't approve, that she wasn't allowed to date, though she longed to grow up and have a boyfriend like other girls her age. “In the past I told my mom something mean I says I wished ur mom was my mom instead of my mom cus mrs Amy let Aleah date anyone she wanted so that hurt my mom,” Gypsy wrote. The new boyfriend's name, Gypsy revealed, was Nicholas Godejohn. They'd been communicating for over two years. He didn't care that she was in a wheelchair. And Gypsy planned to marry him. They were both Catholic. They had agreed on names for their children. She was cooking up an elaborate plan for Dee Dee to casually meet Nick at the local movie theater, after which Gypsy was hoping they could be open about their relationship. This wasn't the first time Aleah had gotten clandestine messages from Gypsy about boys. She knew that Gypsy had tried to meet men online before, that in spite of what Dee Dee said about Gypsy's    mind, thoughts about romance and sex were taking root anyway. But she was concerned. Gypsy had always seemed naive to her. In October 2014, she wrote “I'm 18. Nick  …    is 24,” which made Godejohn six years older. Plus, the way she talked about the relationship was odd. “It was like some kind of magnificent fairy tale was unfolding,” Aleah said over coffee in Springfield last fall. She was worried, too, about Dee Dee, who'd confronted her in 2011 about her chats with Gypsy, telling her she was corrupting a child. “I'm not going to tell your mom about the things you said,” she told Aleah. “But I don't want you talking to Gypsy like that. ” Dee Dee took away Gypsy's phone and computer for a time. Gypsy had always managed, nonetheless, to slip through some crack in her mother's attention, find some other way of getting to Aleah. But the two saw each other less and less, and after the messages about Nick Godejohn in the fall of 2014, Aleah didn't hear from Gypsy again. Standing in front of the house half a year later with the crowd that had gathered, it occurred to Aleah that the police should know about all this. She showed them the Facebook messages, and they wrote the name down. The police also put a trace on the Facebook posts to Dee Dee's account. The IP address was registered to a Nicholas Godejohn in Big Bend, Wisconsin. On June 15, a team of officers in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, were dispatched to Godejohn's house. The standoff was brief. Nick quickly surrendered. Luckily enough, Gypsy was with him, unharmed, in excellent health. Relief flooded everyone, at least for a moment. “Things are not always as they appear,” the Springfield sheriff said at a press conference the next morning. It turned out that, in fact, Gypsy hadn't used a wheelchair from the moment she left her house a few days earlier. She didn't need one. She could walk just fine, there was nothing wrong with her muscles, and she had no medication or oxygen tank with her either. Her hair was short and spiky, but she wasn't bald  —   her head had simply been shaved, all her life, to make her appear ill. She was   if shaken by recent events. The disabled child she'd long been in the eyes of others was nowhere to be found. It was all a fraud, she told the police. All of it. Every last bit. Her mother had made her do it. “I just cried,” Aleah said, her sheer disbelief about everything that had happened overwhelming her. Kim Blanchard cried, too. “At that point it really became: ‘I don't know anything about this person. What have I been believing? How could I have been so stupid? '” “No one asked for any more documentation. No one raised an eyebrow,” Amy Pinegar told me later. “Were they behind closed doors laughing at us”  —   she paused for a second  —   “suckers?” Dee Dee's legal name was Clauddine Blanchard. She'd used various aliases and misspellings over the years: DeDe, Claudine, Deno. By the time she reached Missouri, she went by Clauddinnea and always added an “e” to her last name. Not all of her stories turned out to be false. She was, indeed, from Lafourche Parish, in the ball of Louisiana's foot. She had grown up in a town called Golden Meadow alongside five brothers and sisters, most still living. Her mother died in 1997, but her father is still alive. So is Rod Blanchard, Gypsy's father. He still lives in the area, in Cut Off, not far from Golden Meadow. Gypsy has his nose. He has a laconic manner, sometimes stoic, sometimes funny. He met Dee Dee when he was still in high school, and they dated for four to six months. He was 17 to her 24 when she became pregnant, and at the time the only logical thing he thought he could do was marry her. “I woke up on my birthday, on my 18th birthday, and realized I wasn't where I was supposed to be,” he told me recently. “I wasn't in love with her, really. I knew I got married for the wrong reasons. ” He left Dee Dee, and though she tried on more than one occasion to get him back, the marriage would not stick. Gypsy Rose was born shortly after the couple separated, on July 27, 1991. Rod said Dee Dee liked the name Gypsy, and he was a Guns N' Roses fan. As far as he knows, neither of them knew about Gypsy Rose Lee, the 1920s vaudeville child star turned stripper whose early life was the basis for the Broadway musical Gypsy. That Gypsy had a controlling stage mother too, one who lied about her daughter's age to make her seem younger, one who kept forcing her daughter to perform even though she didn't want to. Gypsy was healthy at birth, Rod said. But when she was 3 months old, Dee Dee became convinced that her baby had sleep apnea, that Gypsy would stop breathing in the night. It was then when Dee Dee began taking her to the hospital. As Rod remembers it, the doctors couldn't find anything, in spite of three rounds of tests and a sleep monitor. The conviction that Gypsy was a sickly child took hold. She explained the increasingly bewildering array of problems to Rod by saying that Gypsy had a chromosomal defect. Many of Gypsy's health issues, she claimed, stemmed from that one thing. It all spiraled so quickly. Dee Dee always had a new idea about what was wrong with Gypsy, a new doctor, a new drug. She had once worked as a nurse's aide she had a knack for remembering medical terminology and spitting it back. The information overload acted as a kind of wall around mother and daughter. It always seemed that Dee Dee had things under control. She knew so much, and she was never troubled by questions  —   she always had an answer. Rod eventually remarried and had two other children. He and his new wife, Kristy, saw Gypsy often over the first 10 years of her life, and can share pictures from various happy family outings right up until 2004. They remember going to the Special Olympics, too, but have good memories of it. “All smiles,” Kristy said. They have a picture of Gypsy grinning widely with her father and brother there. In all those years, Gypsy never said a word against her mother or anything else. Meanwhile, Dee Dee's relationship with her own family, never great to begin with, got worse. The cause isn't clear. (In spite of repeated attempts to contact her father, Claude Pitre, I was never able to speak to her family directly.) She'd begun to get in trouble with the law, usually for small misdemeanors, like writing bad checks. Eventually, Dee Dee simply moved away, to Slidell, two hours north and   to New Orleans across Lake Pontchartrain. Dee Dee and Gypsy spent their years in Slidell living in public housing and visiting doctors at the Tulane University Hospital  Clinic and the Children's Hospital. Dee Dee told doctors there that Gypsy had seizures every couple of months, so they put her on   medications. Dee Dee insisted to one doctor after another that her daughter had muscular dystrophy even after a muscle biopsy proved she didn't. There were problems with her eyes and ears, too, Dee Dee insisted, poor vision and frequent ear infections. Doctors dutifully operated on her. If Gypsy had a cold or cough, she was taken to the emergency room. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit Slidell. The power was off for weeks. The pair turned up in a   shelter in Covington, Louisiana, with pictures of their old apartment in rubble. She told the shelter staff she didn't have Gypsy's medical records with her because they'd been destroyed in the flood. One of the doctors at the shelter, Janet Jordan, was from the Ozarks. (She declined to be interviewed for this article.) She was charmed by Gypsy in the shelter: “When I first met her, I had to cry a little bit, and she goes, ‘It's okay, you're only human. '” Jordan told a local news station in 2005. It was, apparently, she who suggested the Blanchards move to Missouri. The story of a mother and disabled daughter left without anything proved irresistible to local press. It worked on charities, too. Dee Dee and Gypsy were airlifted to Missouri in September 2005, where they rented a house in Aurora. They lived there until the Habitat for Humanity house on West Volunteer Way in March 2008. While Gypsy had been involved with charities for children with disabilities from the time she was quite small  —   Dee Dee often stayed at Ronald McDonald houses  —   this was obviously the largest benefit Dee Dee had managed to arrange. It seemed to give her an appetite for more. While in Springfield, they'd benefit from free flights from a volunteer pilots organization, stays at a lodge for cancer patients, free trips to Disney World through various charity organizations. (None of the organizations with which the Blanchards had confirmed links returned requests for comment.) Dee Dee kept Rod updated on his daughter's whereabouts and medical circumstances. She did this even as she told doctors and new friends in Missouri that he was a drug addict who had abandoned his daughter. Meanwhile, Rod and Kristy spoke to Gypsy pretty often. They always planned to visit, but “for one reason or another, it would never work out,” Rod said. Rod continued to send, as he always had, $1, 200 a month in child support to a New Orleans bank account. He also sent the occasional gifts Dee Dee asked for, television sets, and a Nintendo Wii. He continued to send these things even after Gypsy turned 18, because Dee Dee said Gypsy still required   care. “There was never a question whether or not I was going to stop paying,” he said. There were, occasionally, small signs of deception. When Rod called Gypsy to talk on her 18th birthday, he said, he was excited to make all the jokes dads make to their daughters about becoming an adult. But Dee Dee intercepted the call, he said, to remind him that Gypsy didn't know her true age. “She thinks she's 14,” Dee Dee said. She asked that he not upset Gypsy by claiming otherwise. Rod heeded the instruction. “I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after,” Rod said. “She got so wound up in it, it was like a tornado got started, and then once she was in so deep that there was no escaping. One lie had to cover another lie, had to cover another lie, and that was her way of life. ” They never saw all the local news stories about Dee Dee and Gypsy that had been written and filmed up in Missouri. They knew nothing of any charity drives and trips except what Dee Dee told them, which was very little. That all changed last June when Rod called Kristy, sobbing in the middle of a workday. Dee Dee's sister had called him Dee Dee was dead and Gypsy was missing. “I was in hysterics thinking she got brought somewhere and was left to die,” Kristy said. And if Gypsy was found, she continued, “how could I take care of her when Dee Dee knew everything on how to take care of her?” The first time Rod saw his daughter walk was in a news report on Gypsy's arraignment hearing in Wisconsin. No one had prepared them Kristy had spotted the video on Facebook. Rod was so confused when he saw it that he said his first reaction was, “I was really happy that she was walking. ” When Gypsy's attorney showed them Dee Dee's autopsy report, Kristy said she stared for a while at the portion about Dee Dee's brain. The lawyer asked her why. “I want to know what the hell was going through her mind,” Kristy said. “What is in that brain of hers that triggered all of this shit?” Dee Dee won't ever be able to answer anyone's questions. All there will be is Gypsy's story. And Gypsy doesn't know all of it herself. From the time she was arrested to my more recent talks with her in prison in Missouri, she is confused about details large and small. For example: When she was arrested, Gypsy told the police that she was 19. Rod and Kristy were able to straighten that out by giving authorities Gypsy's birth certificate. She was actually 23. Parents make your world, and Dee Dee made Gypsy's into one where she did, indeed, have cancer. Gypsy told me her mother said some of the medications were related to it. Even as she grew older, she wasn't sure how to question it. There are lingering questions, in fact, about exactly what medications Gypsy was given over the years. Some of them may never have been prescribed to Gypsy at all her attorney, for example, suspects Dee Dee gave Gypsy some kind of tranquilizer. The pile of bogus diagnoses, the confusing lists of drugs: It all points to a syndrome called Munchausen by proxy. Munchausen syndrome was first identified by a British psychiatrist named Richard Asher in 1951. A successor, Roy Meadow, identified Munchausen by proxy in 1977. It has been in the DSM, the diagnostic manual used by psychiatrists, since 1980. (In the latest version, the   it goes by the name “factitious disorder,” but for clarity's sake I'll stick to the Munchausen nomenclature.) In short, a person with the syndrome either feigns or induces physical and psychological symptoms for no obvious benefit other than attention and sympathy. If the person does this to themselves, it's plain Munchausen syndrome when the symptoms are feigned or induced in others, it's called Munchausen by proxy. The   recommends distinguishing Munchausen syndrome from what is called “malingering,” that is, faking or inducing symptoms of illness where there is some hope of material benefit. Malingering isn't considered to be a mental illness. It's just plain fraud. While most with the syndrome are mothers, there are also documented cases of fathers doing this to their children, husbands doing this to their wives, nieces doing this to their aunts. And doctors often don't detect it for months or years. In fact, it's difficult to say just how prevalent Munchausen is in the general population. By its very nature, it hides in plain sight. That doctors often miss Munchausen seems counterintuitive, but the   relationship is a bond of trust that goes both ways. “As health care providers,” said Caroline Burton, a doctor at the Mayo Clinic in Florida who's treated cases of Munchausen where the proxy is an adult, “we rely on what a patient tells us. ” Even if a doctor suspects his or her patient is lying, there isn't much incentive to refuse treatment based on the doubt. What if the doctor is wrong and the patient suffers for it? “You have to be careful not to overlook organic disease,” Burton said. “You've really gotta go through quite a lot of diagnostic hurdles. ” A diagnosis of Munchausen syndrome by proxy is attached to the perpetrator, not to the victim. Because Dee Dee is dead, it's impossible to diagnose her. She didn't leave behind a diary or some other documentation of her intentions. She did keep a binder of medical information in which she seemed to be sorting through the different information she'd given to various doctors. And she did fit certain parameters that doctors often cite as red flags for Munchausen syndrome: For example, she had some medical training. The number of doctors she took Gypsy to see over the years, and her propensity for changing locations so there was no clear medical trail, is also common. So are the concerns over sleep apnea, which is one way Munchausen often seems to begin in the various documented cases. It is also not unusual, as Burton told me, for extended family members  —   and even sometimes immediate ones  —   to be totally unaware of the feigning of illness. “The perpetrators are very intelligent people,” she said. “They know how to manipulate other people. ” They manipulate their victims, too, and the longer it goes on, the higher the chances are that the actual patient might collude with the perpetrator. The desire to please a parent can be enough to enlist a child in the deception. But even in adult cases, there can be some kind of emotional attachment keeping the patient in on the lie. “The relationship that develops between the two is so unhealthy,” Burton told me, of the adult cases she had treated. And no source I consulted had ever heard of a case where the abuse went on for this long, into their adulthood. One thing seems certain: For the patient in a Munchausen by proxy case, the truth becomes corroded. Gypsy's medical records are sobering. All the way back in 2001, doctors at Tulane University Hospital tested Gypsy for muscular dystrophy. Her tests came back negative. In fact, all scans of her brain and spine were relatively clear. The records of all those tests survived Katrina. Nonetheless, Dee Dee continued to insist to doctor after doctor in Louisiana and Missouri that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy. Most doctors appear from these records to have taken her assertion at face value and didn't probe. Instead they proceeded to treat Gypsy for various vision, hearing, sleep, and salivation problems that were presumed to flow from the muscular dystrophy. (The records I reviewed for this article appeared to cover only some of Gypsy's care. It's impossible to say how many other relevant records might exist.) Some interventions were surgical. Gypsy's eye muscles were repeatedly operated on for alleged weakness. Tubes were put in her ears for alleged ear infections. She was given a feeding tube and ate very little by mouth, surviving on cans of the meal replacement PediaSure well into her twenties. Her salivary glands were first injected with Botox, then removed because her mother complained that she drooled too much. Gypsy's teeth rotted out and had to be extracted, though whether that was because of poor dental hygiene or a mixture of medications and severe malnutrition, it's hard to say. The repeated invasions of Gypsy's body in the name of these illnesses she turned out not to have were, in short, serious and prolonged. It is difficult to say now whether any of it was medically needed at all. What is not difficult to say is that all of it began when Gypsy was impossibly young and could hardly have been expected to challenge authority figures  —   her mother or her doctors  —   about how she was feeling. For their part, doctors did not pick up on innumerable hints that Dee Dee's stories did not add up  —   not even the sleep doctor, Robert Beckerman, who saw Gypsy both in New Orleans and in Kansas City. Instead he featured his treatment of Gypsy in the hospital newsletter and mentioned repeatedly in the medical files that she and Dee Dee were his “favorite mother, daughter patient. ” (Beckerman did not reply to requests for comment for this story.) There was one exception. In 2007, a pediatric neurologist named Bernardo Flasterstein, consulting on the case in Springfield, became suspicious. In a recent phone conversation, Flasterstein told me he had his doubts from the first time he saw Dee Dee and Gypsy. Dee Dee's stories about Gypsy's myriad illnesses didn't fly with him. In his notes to Gypsy's primary care doctor after the first visit, he wrote, in bold, underlined type, “The mother is not a good historian. ” There was an “unusual distribution” to Gypsy's weakness for a muscular dystrophy patient, he wrote in his notes. Still, Flasterstein says, he gave the case the “benefit of the doubt” and sent Gypsy for all the usual tests, the MRIs and the blood work. It all came back normal. “I remember having her stand up,” he told me, “and she could hold her own weight!” He said he told Dee Dee, “I don't see any reason why she doesn't walk. ” In between his visits with Gypsy, Flasterstein tracked down a doctor who had seen Gypsy in New Orleans. That doctor told him that the muscle biopsy in New Orleans had been negative for muscular dystrophy, and that Gypsy's previous neurologist had explained that to Dee Dee. When confronted with the problem, Dee Dee simply stopped seeing those New Orleans doctors. “Analyzing all the facts, and after talking to her previous pediatrician,” Flasterstein wrote in the file, “there is a strong possibility of Munchausen by proxy, with maybe some underlying unknown etiology to explain for her symptoms. ” Dee Dee stopped seeing him after that visit. “I assume she got my notes,” Flasterstein says. He said nurses told him later that on the way out of his office on that last visit, Dee Dee was complaining that he didn't know what he was talking about. Flasterstein never followed up. He told me that in the network of Springfield doctors Dee Dee saw, “everyone bought their story. ” He remembers being told to treat the pair with “golden gloves. ” He says he thought that if he reported it to social services, they wouldn't believe him either. Thinking about it now, Flasterstein regrets not doing more. He says this was only the second case of Munchausen he'd seen in his   career. He heard about the murder when a former nurse in his office wrote him about it last year. “Poor Gypsy,” he told me. “She suffered all those years, and for no reason. ” He wishes he “could have been more aggressive. ” It was not the only missed opportunity for authorities to intervene. In the fall of 2009, someone made an anonymous call to the Springfield Police Department, asking for a wellness check. The person said that they had doubts that Gypsy was suffering from all the ailments her mother described. (Flasterstein says it was not he who made that call.) The police drove over to the house, but Dee Dee put their fears to rest. She told them that the reason she sometimes used inconsistent birth dates and spellings of her name was to hide from an abusive husband. No one called Rod Blanchard, or checked on these claims. The police accepted the explanation. Gypsy “does suffer from some type of mental handicap,” they wrote in their report. The file was closed. Gypsy also tried, once, to escape her mother. She met a man at the science fiction convention that Kim Blanchard and her husband also attended. Gypsy and this man began communicating online. At the time, in February 2011, Gypsy and Dee Dee were leaving everyone with the impression that she was 15. (She was actually 19.) According to Kim, the man in question was 35. He took Gypsy back to his hotel room. Through conventioneer intelligence  —   “We were all overprotective of her,” Kim Blanchard said  —   Dee Dee found them. She apparently knocked on the hotel room door with papers that showed Gypsy was a minor, and the man let Gypsy leave. (He could not be reached for comment.) After that incident, Dee Dee was furious to the point of public spectacle. She smashed the family computer with a hammer, cursed the internet to her friends. When she eventually replaced it, Gypsy was allowed to use the internet only with Dee Dee's supervision. And for months afterward, Kim Blanchard said, Gypsy was subdued, though “she wasn't acting any differently than a normal child who was in trouble at that point. ” The whole situation has left bystanders in Springfield with feelings of guilt. “I just wish she would have come to me,” Aleah Woodmansee told me. A lot of people feel that way. If Gypsy had, just once, stood up and walked across the room, the spell would have been broken. But plainly it wasn't that easy for her. In a way, that makes sense. She slipped, as people are fond of saying, through just about everyone's cracks. She had no reason to believe that her life would change. Until, apparently, she met Nick Godejohn. Under other circumstances, a tale of child abuse as long and as involved as what Gypsy experienced might have inspired public sympathy. But something about the fraud element deeply offended people, particularly those who hadn't known Gypsy or Dee Dee at all. Evidently there are a lot of people who are worried that others who are sick and disabled don't deserve their generosity. So Facebook groups began to spring up. They splintered on whether Gypsy could be said to be blamed, whether Rod and Kristy were in some way in on the fraud. Some groups ballooned to over 10, 000 members, some of them posting every day about the crime, voicing unfounded theories about what had happened. If their speculation had been confined to private forums, it might have been one thing. But more than a few of these amateur detectives were not satisfied with online discussion. They wanted to affect the case in real time. A St. Louis —  based Thought Catalog writer named Meagan Pack was keeping track of “tips” she'd gotten from Facebook about Gypsy and Dee Dee's crimes and posting them to a   post. Pack told me she called the police detective to inform him of all she'd learned. Random observers on Facebook also called the police with their various speculations. Then, when the court hearings began, they came to those, too. One even showed up to Dee Dee's house when the initial “That bitch is dead” Facebook post went viral in Springfield. She hadn't known Gypsy or Dee Dee at all. She was shooed away from the crime scene by the neighbors and the police. The result was informational chaos. Kim Blanchard's GoFundMe became a flashpoint for online sleuths. When Dee Dee's financial fraud was revealed by the sheriff, Kim shut it down, but not before the groups had taken it upon themselves to investigate Kim herself. Several thought Kim and David Blanchard were lying about their involvement with Gypsy and Dee Dee, and assumed they were relatives because of their last name. Kristy Blanchard, meanwhile, was still gathering a lot of the news about her stepdaughter from Facebook. That's when she discovered that many thought she and Rod were in on Dee Dee's plans. Others thought Rod must have been a neglectful father who didn't financially support his own child. “They don't understand that I've always been supportive,” he said. “In every way,” Kristy chimed in. In fact, if anything, Dee Dee may have had so much money  —   Gypsy and Nick had escaped with about $4, 000 from Dee Dee's safe  —   because they were receiving his support checks. (Dee Dee died intestate, without a will, and apparently without meaningful assets other than that cash.) Kristy tried, at first, to defend herself and Rod to these groups, but it turned out they were hard to convince. “It was hell,” she said. She withdrew from all the groups and asked friends and family to stop accepting new friend requests, which were pouring in. The neighbors in Springfield also had this problem. “It was like, ‘Forget you! '” Amy Pinegar said of the few attempts she made to correct the online sleuths on their factual errors. The obsessives ended up piling confusion onto the already confusing situation Dee Dee had created. And they proved quite resilient. At the hearing I attended in September 2015, two people from the largest Facebook group were there. After the hearing, they made a beeline for the local television crew and started talking to them. Gypsy's attorney, Michael Stanfield, saw them too, and tried to hurry out of the courtroom to confront them. “Who were those people?” he asked the television crew. “What did they say?” For a while, it seemed like Gypsy's case would, eventually, go to trial. The prosecutor declined to go for the death penalty, but both Gypsy and Nick were charged with   murder. As the investigation into the crime continued, it turned up text messages between the two that appeared to discuss and plan Dee Dee's death. “Honey, you forget I am ruthless, and my hatred of her will force her to die,” Godejohn texted Gypsy. “It's my evil side doing it. He won't mess up, because he enjoys killing. ” Prosecutors also said they found social media evidence of Gypsy directly asking Godejohn to kill her mother, though these have never been made public. Documents from pretrial discovery show him telling a friend about Gypsy's desire to murder her mother as early as May 2014. Godejohn referred to his “evil side” because he and Gypsy had constructed an elaborate online fantasy life, mostly through a jigsaw puzzle of Facebook accounts. They were into BDSM imagery. They had specific names and roles for each other. They took pictures of themselves in costumes, Gypsy dressing up at one point as the comic book character Harley Quinn, posing with a knife. Reality and fantasy blended quite a lot, for both of them. Even now, it's not clear why Godejohn participated in this scheme. He had no history of violence. (Reached by telephone, Godejohn's attorney Andrew Mead declined to comment on the case.) His only prior arrest was for lewd conduct in 2013 at a McDonald's, where he had been watching pornography on a tablet. But both he and Gypsy told police he was the one to wield the knife. She said that while her mother was being stabbed, she was in the other room, listening. One of the taxi drivers who'd carted the pair around Springfield after the murder told interviewers they thought Gypsy was the ringleader. Gypsy's attorney, Michael Stanfield, is a public defender. In an average year, he told me, he handles over 270 individual cases. He drew Gypsy's case at random and had no idea what he was in for. “I think this is probably the most complicated case I'll ever get,” he said. The Greene County public defender's office was somewhat lucky, in that they were also able to pull a former leading public defender, Clate Baker, out of retirement for the case. Stanfield also had an investigator and a paralegal working on it. Kristy and Rod had no money to hire a private attorney, though they told me repeatedly as I reported this story that they would never have told Gypsy to switch attorneys because they found Stanfield so capable and reassuring. The process of figuring out what had happened was, in a word, complex. Stanfield went down to Louisiana and dredged up some elements of Dee Dee's past. It took him months to get Gypsy's own medical records, because Dee Dee had set up a power of attorney over Gypsy's medical decisions after Gypsy turned 18. The hospitals refused to help, even though the power of attorney did not surrender Gypsy's rights to look at her own medical documents. When the records finally arrived, though, they were so damning, Stanfield called the prosecutor without needing to investigate further. A plea deal was worked out. On July 5, Gypsy pleaded guilty to   murder. The judge gave her the minimum sentence: 10 years. With the year she's served, she'll be eligible for parole in about seven and a half years, at the end of 2023. By then she will be 32 years old. For his part, Godejohn is still scheduled for trial in November. It was not, Stanfield told me, a listed condition of Gypsy's plea bargain that she testify against him. At a recent hearing in   he looked bewildered and lost, a beard concealing most of his face. His family never seems to come to hearings. Gypsy is now an inmate being processed at the Women's Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Vandalia, Missouri. Her hair is long, her skin clear and healthy, and she wears proper adult glasses. She's off all her medications, and there have been no health problems in the year she's been out of her mother's control. “Most of my clients lose weight in prison,” Stanfield pointed out, because the food is so bad. Gypsy gained 14 pounds in the 12 months she spent in Greene County Jail before her plea. Kim Blanchard, who visited Gypsy once in jail, told me, “She looked much more like the person that she was, which was the complete opposite of the person that I knew, and it was like she had a costume on that whole time and then took it off. ” But obviously, there are lingering effects. When I last checked her inmate record, it still had her last name misspelled, bearing the extra “e” that her mother somehow thought was a good disguise. In the Greene County Jail, Gypsy had a therapist she saw once a week. It remains to be seen if she'll have one in her new home, or if that therapist will be trained to attend to the specifics of her unique situation. Rod and Kristy saw Gypsy not too long after the plea bargain. It has been a relief to know what's going to happen to her. They don't know if they're going to sue the hospitals or doctors that Gypsy saw all her life. They'll decide that after everything has settled down, after they can properly talk to Gypsy. While the case was pending, they never discussed the crime with her the prosecutor forbade it. Now there will be more to talk about. They're hoping to get up to her new facility two or three times a year. It's a long drive, and there's still the matter of money. Months ago, Rod and Kristy told me they still catch Gypsy in small lies about her life, things she's clearly afraid to be frank with them about. It worries them. “Of course we want her to get better about that,” Kristy said. When I spoke to them more recently, Rod's voice was sagging a little. He sounded older. He said he'd started to wonder what exactly Dee Dee had told Gypsy about him all those years. He had only begun to pose those questions. He was wondering lately, he said, how Dee Dee had managed to be so friendly on the phone all those years if she hated him so much. He asked Gypsy about it. “She said, ‘Keep your enemies close,'” Gypsy told him. For most of the year I spent reporting this article, the case was pending and I wasn't able to speak to Gypsy herself. After the plea deal, that changed. I sent her a note. She called me from prison in Missouri to talk in short conversations broken up over a few days. Her voice is still   though now that we know what we know, it no longer seems unusually high at all. People heard what they wanted to. Gypsy speaks in long, beautiful sentences. She is sometimes so eloquent in conversation that it is hard to believe anyone could have ever spoken with her and thought her “slow,” as some put it. It reminded me of all the doctors who wrote in her files that in spite of Gypsy's alleged cognitive defect, she had a “rich vocabulary. ” She was eager to talk, barely able to contain herself once she started. She wants people to know, she said, that this wasn't a situation where a girl killed her mom to be with her boyfriend. This was a situation, she said, of a girl trying to escape abuse. In prison she's hoping to join all sorts of programs, to help people. She wants to write a book to help others in her situation. I asked her what I'd long been waiting to ask her: When did she realize her life was different, that there was something wrong? “Whenever I was 19,” she said. She meant the time when she ran away with the man at the convention in 2011. When her mother came to take her back, she began to wonder why she wasn't allowed to be alone, to have friends. About her mother, her opinion seems to waver. “The doctors thought that she was so devoted and caring,” Gypsy said. “I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick. But I'm not sick. There's that big, big difference. ” Gypsy still doesn't feel she actively deceived anyone. “I feel like I was just as used as everybody else,” she said. “She used me as a pawn. I was in the dark about it. The only thing I knew was that I could walk, and that I could eat. As for everything else  …     Well, she'd shave my hair off. And she'd say, ‘It's gonna fall out anyway, so let's keep it nice and neat! '” Gypsy said her mother told her she had cancer, too, and would tell her that her medication was cancer medication. She just accepted it. As for a childlike demeanor, Gypsy grew defensive when I asked her about it. “It's not my fault. I can't help it. This is my voice. ” Often, it didn't occur to her to question any of it, and when it did, she worried about hurting her mother's feelings. It often seems to Gypsy, even now, that Dee Dee really thought she was sick. “I was afraid that we were gonna get in trouble,” Gypsy said. “The line between right and wrong  …    was kinda blurred, 'cause that's the way I was taught. I just grew up that way. ” “When I think about it now,” she added, “I wish I would have reached out to somebody and told somebody before I told Nick. ” She mostly used the internet late at night, when her mother was asleep. Nick, she said, was the first person who had offered her real protection. She believed him. Ultimately, after everything that happened, she said she thinks he has “anger issues. ” She repeatedly takes responsibility for the murder: “What I did was wrong. I'll have to live with it. ” But she said Nick is the one who took “a plot between us both” and “made it into action. ” Gypsy was the one who had the idea to post about the murder on Facebook, so that the police would come check on her mom. She recalled asking Nick, “Can we please just post something on Facebook, something alarming, that would make people call the police?” But she said he told her what to write. I asked, repeatedly: Are you angry? With your mom? With the doctors? She will admit only to frustration. “It makes me frustrated that none of the other doctors could see that I was perfectly healthy. That my legs were not skinny, like someone who was [really] paralyzed. That I can't  …     I don't need a feeding tube. Stuff like that. ” In jail, Gypsy had access to tablet computers. She looked up the definition of Munchausen, after hearing the word so often used to describe her situation. Her mother matched every symptom, she told me. Every once in a while, I'd get Gypsy explaining some element of her abuse in such detail that something in me would break. Once, feeling speechless but aware that the clock was ticking on her phone time, I blurted out, “I'm so sorry this happened to you. ” Gypsy immediately switched into the girl she was back in those   local news interviews. “It's okay. I mean, honestly, it's made me a stronger person, because I truly believe that everything happens for a reason. ” Even on the subject of her prison sentence, Gypsy is a model of radical acceptance. She's told people she feels freer in prison than she did when living with her mom. “This time is good for me,” she said to me. “I've been raised to do what my mother taught me to do. And those things aren't very good. ” “She taught me to lie, and I don't wanna lie. I want to be a good, honest person. ” ●   ",False," For seven years before the murder, Dee Dee and Gypsy Rose Blancharde lived in a small pink bungalow on West Volunteer Way in Springfield, Missouri. Their neighbors liked them. 'Sweet' is the word I'd use, a former friend of Dee Dee's told me not too long ago. Once you met them, people said, they were impossible to forget. Dee Dee was 48 years old, originally from Louisiana. She was a large,   person, which she reinforced by dressing in bright, cheerful colors. She had curly brown hair she liked to hold back with ribbons. People who knew her remember her as generous with her time and, when she could be, generous with money. She could make friends quickly and inspire deep devotion. She did not have a job, but instead served as a   caretaker for Gypsy Rose, her teenage daughter. Gypsy was a tiny thing, perhaps 5 feet tall as far as anyone could guess. She was confined to a wheelchair. Her round face was overwhelmed by a pair of owlish glasses. She was pale and skinny, and her teeth were crumbling and painful. She had a feeding tube. Sometimes Dee Dee had to drag an oxygen tank around with them, nasal cannula looped around Gypsy's small ears. Ask about her daughter's diagnoses, and Dee Dee would reel off a list as long as her arm: chromosomal defects, muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, severe asthma, sleep apnea, eye problems. It had always been this way, Dee Dee said, ever since Gypsy was a baby. She had spent time in neonatal intensive care. She had leukemia as a toddler. The endless health crises had taken a toll. Gypsy was friendly, talkative even, but her voice was high and childlike. Dee Dee would often remind people that her daughter had brain damage. She had to be homeschooled, because she'd never be able to keep up with other kids. Gypsy had the mind of a child of 7, Dee Dee said. It was important to remember that in dealing with her. She loved princess outfits and dressing up. She wore wigs and hats to cover her small head. A curly, blonde Cinderella number seems to have been her favorite. She's wearing it in so many photographs of herself with her mother. She was always with her mother. We are a pair of shoes, Gypsy once said. Never good without the other.  Their house, like everyone else's around them, had been built by Habitat for Humanity. It had amenities specially built for Gypsy: a ramp up to the front door, a Jacuzzi tub to help with my muscles, Gypsy told a local television station in 2008. Sometimes, on summer nights, Dee Dee would set up a projector to play a movie on the side of her house and the children of the neighborhood, whose parents usually couldn't afford to send them to a movie theater, came over for a treat. Dee Dee charged for concessions, but it was still cheaper than the local multiplex. The money was to go to Gypsy's treatments. Dee Dee became particularly close with some people across the way, a single mother named Amy Pinegar and her four children. Over years of tea and coffee, Dee Dee would tell Pinegar her life story. She was originally from a small town in Louisiana, she said, but she'd had to flee her abusive family with Gypsy. It was her own father, Gypsy's grandfather, who'd been the last straw he'd burned Gypsy with cigarettes. So she'd lit out from her hometown for good. She told Pinegar that Gypsy's father was a deadbeat, an alcoholic drug abuser who had mocked his daughter's disabilities, called the Special Olympics a freak show.  As Pinegar understood it, he'd never sent them a dime, not even when Dee Dee and Gypsy had lost everything in Hurricane Katrina. It was a blessing that a doctor at a rescue shelter had helped them get to the Ozarks. Sometimes, listening, Amy Pinegar found herself overwhelmed. I wondered, Pinegar told me over the phone last fall, keeping this child alive       Is she that happy? All she could do was be a good neighbor and pitch in when she could. She'd drive Dee Dee and Gypsy to the airport for their medical trips to Kansas City, bring them things from Sam's Club. Ultimately, they did seem happy. They went on charity trips to Disney World, met Miranda Lambert through the    Foundation. Looking back on it, Pinegar was sometimes even jealous of them. It was a perfect story for a human interest segment on the evening news: a family living through tragedy and disaster, managing to build a life for themselves in spite of so many obstacles. But the story wasn't over. One day last June, Dee Dee's Facebook account posted an update. That bitch is dead, it read. It was June 14, a hot Sunday afternoon that had driven a lot of people indoors to the blessings of  . The first few comments on the status are from friends expressing wild disbelief. Maybe the page had been hacked. Maybe someone should call. Does anyone know where they live? Should someone call the police, give them the address? As they debated it, a new comment from Dee Dee's account appeared on the status: I fucken SLASHED THAT FAT PIG AND RAPED HER SWEET INNOCENT DAUGHTER      HER SCREAM WAS SOOOO FUCKEN LOUD LOL.  Kim Blanchard, who lived nearby, was among the first to react. Though Kim had a similar last name to the Blanchardes, she wasn't a relative. She had met Dee Dee and Gypsy in 2009 at a science fiction and fantasy convention held in the Ozarks, where Gypsy could wear costumes and not be particularly out of place. They were just perfect, Kim said. Here was this poor, sick child who was being taken care of by a wonderful, patient mother who only wanted to help everybody.  Kim called Dee Dee's number, but there was no answer. Kim's husband, David, suggested that they drive on over to the house just to make sure everything was all right. When they arrived, a crowd of worried neighbors was already gathering. Dee Dee and Gypsy had sometimes been unreachable before, off on a medical trip without telling anyone. The windows had a protective film on them it was hard to see in. Knocking on the doors brought no response. But everyone found it suspicious that Dee Dee's new cube van, which could easily transport Gypsy around in her wheelchair, was parked in the driveway. Kim called 911. The police couldn't enter the house without a warrant, but didn't stop David from climbing through a window. Inside, he saw nothing amiss. All the lights had been turned off, and the   was on high. There were no signs of a robbery, or any struggle. All of Gypsy's wheelchairs were still in the house. It was frightening to think about how helpless she might be without them. The police began taking statements while they waited for a search warrant. Kim relayed information back to Facebook. Yes, they'd been to the house yes, the police had been called. Dee Dee's online friends and acquaintances began bombarding Kim with questions. She answered as best she could, but the status was beginning to get shared around Missouri. Here's the thing guys      I know everyone is very concerned, Kim wrote on Facebook. We need to realize that whoever posted this can read all of this.  The search warrant didn't come through until 10:45 that night. The police found Dee Dee's body in the bedroom. She'd been stabbed, and had been dead for several days. But there was no sign of Gypsy. The next day, Kim organized a vigil and a GoFundMe account to take care of Dee Dee's funeral expenses     and possibly Gypsy's. Everyone feared the worst. All her life, Gypsy had evoked protective responses in people. She was so small and looked so helpless. Many people couldn't understand why this had happened to her. Who could prey on someone who had no defenses? Meanwhile, the police were starting to sort things out. A young woman named Aleah Woodmansee had approached them. There were some things she knew, things that might be helpful. For example, she told them, Gypsy had a secret online boyfriend. Aleah was Amy Pinegar's daughter, a    who'd worked as a medical claims investigator. She felt like a big sister to Gypsy, and evidently Gypsy felt the same. But they were rarely alone together, as Gypsy's mother was constantly by her side. So when Gypsy confided in Aleah, it was through a secret Facebook account, under the name Emma Rose. This is my personal account my mom is still overprotective so she don't, know about this account, Gypsy wrote in October 2014. Then she confessed she'd met a man on a Christian singles site. She was in love with him, she told Aleah. Gypsy hadn't yet told her mother. She wrote that she knew Dee Dee wouldn't approve, that she wasn't allowed to date, though she longed to grow up and have a boyfriend like other girls her age. In the past I told my mom something mean I says I wished ur mom was my mom instead of my mom cus mrs Amy let Aleah date anyone she wanted so that hurt my mom, Gypsy wrote. The new boyfriend's name, Gypsy revealed, was Nicholas Godejohn. They'd been communicating for over two years. He didn't care that she was in a wheelchair. And Gypsy planned to marry him. They were both Catholic. They had agreed on names for their children. She was cooking up an elaborate plan for Dee Dee to casually meet Nick at the local movie theater, after which Gypsy was hoping they could be open about their relationship. This wasn't the first time Aleah had gotten clandestine messages from Gypsy about boys. She knew that Gypsy had tried to meet men online before, that in spite of what Dee Dee said about Gypsy's    mind, thoughts about romance and sex were taking root anyway. But she was concerned. Gypsy had always seemed naive to her. In October 2014, she wrote I'm 18. Nick      is 24, which made Godejohn six years older. Plus, the way she talked about the relationship was odd. It was like some kind of magnificent fairy tale was unfolding, Aleah said over coffee in Springfield last fall. She was worried, too, about Dee Dee, who'd confronted her in 2011 about her chats with Gypsy, telling her she was corrupting a child. I'm not going to tell your mom about the things you said, she told Aleah. But I don't want you talking to Gypsy like that.  Dee Dee took away Gypsy's phone and computer for a time. Gypsy had always managed, nonetheless, to slip through some crack in her mother's attention, find some other way of getting to Aleah. But the two saw each other less and less, and after the messages about Nick Godejohn in the fall of 2014, Aleah didn't hear from Gypsy again. Standing in front of the house half a year later with the crowd that had gathered, it occurred to Aleah that the police should know about all this. She showed them the Facebook messages, and they wrote the name down. The police also put a trace on the Facebook posts to Dee Dee's account. The IP address was registered to a Nicholas Godejohn in Big Bend, Wisconsin. On June 15, a team of officers in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, were dispatched to Godejohn's house. The standoff was brief. Nick quickly surrendered. Luckily enough, Gypsy was with him, unharmed, in excellent health. Relief flooded everyone, at least for a moment. Things are not always as they appear, the Springfield sheriff said at a press conference the next morning. It turned out that, in fact, Gypsy hadn't used a wheelchair from the moment she left her house a few days earlier. She didn't need one. She could walk just fine, there was nothing wrong with her muscles, and she had no medication or oxygen tank with her either. Her hair was short and spiky, but she wasn't bald     her head had simply been shaved, all her life, to make her appear ill. She was   if shaken by recent events. The disabled child she'd long been in the eyes of others was nowhere to be found. It was all a fraud, she told the police. All of it. Every last bit. Her mother had made her do it. I just cried, Aleah said, her sheer disbelief about everything that had happened overwhelming her. Kim Blanchard cried, too. At that point it really became: I don't know anything about this person. What have I been believing? How could I have been so stupid? ' No one asked for any more documentation. No one raised an eyebrow, Amy Pinegar told me later. Were they behind closed doors laughing at us     she paused for a second     suckers? Dee Dee's legal name was Clauddine Blanchard. She'd used various aliases and misspellings over the years: DeDe, Claudine, Deno. By the time she reached Missouri, she went by Clauddinnea and always added an e to her last name. Not all of her stories turned out to be false. She was, indeed, from Lafourche Parish, in the ball of Louisiana's foot. She had grown up in a town called Golden Meadow alongside five brothers and sisters, most still living. Her mother died in 1997, but her father is still alive. So is Rod Blanchard, Gypsy's father. He still lives in the area, in Cut Off, not far from Golden Meadow. Gypsy has his nose. He has a laconic manner, sometimes stoic, sometimes funny. He met Dee Dee when he was still in high school, and they dated for four to six months. He was 17 to her 24 when she became pregnant, and at the time the only logical thing he thought he could do was marry her. I woke up on my birthday, on my 18th birthday, and realized I wasn't where I was supposed to be, he told me recently. I wasn't in love with her, really. I knew I got married for the wrong reasons.  He left Dee Dee, and though she tried on more than one occasion to get him back, the marriage would not stick. Gypsy Rose was born shortly after the couple separated, on July 27, 1991. Rod said Dee Dee liked the name Gypsy, and he was a Guns N' Roses fan. As far as he knows, neither of them knew about Gypsy Rose Lee, the 1920s vaudeville child star turned stripper whose early life was the basis for the Broadway musical Gypsy. That Gypsy had a controlling stage mother too, one who lied about her daughter's age to make her seem younger, one who kept forcing her daughter to perform even though she didn't want to. Gypsy was healthy at birth, Rod said. But when she was 3 months old, Dee Dee became convinced that her baby had sleep apnea, that Gypsy would stop breathing in the night. It was then when Dee Dee began taking her to the hospital. As Rod remembers it, the doctors couldn't find anything, in spite of three rounds of tests and a sleep monitor. The conviction that Gypsy was a sickly child took hold. She explained the increasingly bewildering array of problems to Rod by saying that Gypsy had a chromosomal defect. Many of Gypsy's health issues, she claimed, stemmed from that one thing. It all spiraled so quickly. Dee Dee always had a new idea about what was wrong with Gypsy, a new doctor, a new drug. She had once worked as a nurse's aide she had a knack for remembering medical terminology and spitting it back. The information overload acted as a kind of wall around mother and daughter. It always seemed that Dee Dee had things under control. She knew so much, and she was never troubled by questions     she always had an answer. Rod eventually remarried and had two other children. He and his new wife, Kristy, saw Gypsy often over the first 10 years of her life, and can share pictures from various happy family outings right up until 2004. They remember going to the Special Olympics, too, but have good memories of it. All smiles, Kristy said. They have a picture of Gypsy grinning widely with her father and brother there. In all those years, Gypsy never said a word against her mother or anything else. Meanwhile, Dee Dee's relationship with her own family, never great to begin with, got worse. The cause isn't clear. (In spite of repeated attempts to contact her father, Claude Pitre, I was never able to speak to her family directly.) She'd begun to get in trouble with the law, usually for small misdemeanors, like writing bad checks. Eventually, Dee Dee simply moved away, to Slidell, two hours north and   to New Orleans across Lake Pontchartrain. Dee Dee and Gypsy spent their years in Slidell living in public housing and visiting doctors at the Tulane University Hospital  Clinic and the Children's Hospital. Dee Dee told doctors there that Gypsy had seizures every couple of months, so they put her on   medications. Dee Dee insisted to one doctor after another that her daughter had muscular dystrophy even after a muscle biopsy proved she didn't. There were problems with her eyes and ears, too, Dee Dee insisted, poor vision and frequent ear infections. Doctors dutifully operated on her. If Gypsy had a cold or cough, she was taken to the emergency room. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit Slidell. The power was off for weeks. The pair turned up in a   shelter in Covington, Louisiana, with pictures of their old apartment in rubble. She told the shelter staff she didn't have Gypsy's medical records with her because they'd been destroyed in the flood. One of the doctors at the shelter, Janet Jordan, was from the Ozarks. (She declined to be interviewed for this article.) She was charmed by Gypsy in the shelter: When I first met her, I had to cry a little bit, and she goes, It's okay, you're only human. ' Jordan told a local news station in 2005. It was, apparently, she who suggested the Blanchards move to Missouri. The story of a mother and disabled daughter left without anything proved irresistible to local press. It worked on charities, too. Dee Dee and Gypsy were airlifted to Missouri in September 2005, where they rented a house in Aurora. They lived there until the Habitat for Humanity house on West Volunteer Way in March 2008. While Gypsy had been involved with charities for children with disabilities from the time she was quite small     Dee Dee often stayed at Ronald McDonald houses     this was obviously the largest benefit Dee Dee had managed to arrange. It seemed to give her an appetite for more. While in Springfield, they'd benefit from free flights from a volunteer pilots organization, stays at a lodge for cancer patients, free trips to Disney World through various charity organizations. (None of the organizations with which the Blanchards had confirmed links returned requests for comment.) Dee Dee kept Rod updated on his daughter's whereabouts and medical circumstances. She did this even as she told doctors and new friends in Missouri that he was a drug addict who had abandoned his daughter. Meanwhile, Rod and Kristy spoke to Gypsy pretty often. They always planned to visit, but for one reason or another, it would never work out, Rod said. Rod continued to send, as he always had, $1, 200 a month in child support to a New Orleans bank account. He also sent the occasional gifts Dee Dee asked for, television sets, and a Nintendo Wii. He continued to send these things even after Gypsy turned 18, because Dee Dee said Gypsy still required   care. There was never a question whether or not I was going to stop paying, he said. There were, occasionally, small signs of deception. When Rod called Gypsy to talk on her 18th birthday, he said, he was excited to make all the jokes dads make to their daughters about becoming an adult. But Dee Dee intercepted the call, he said, to remind him that Gypsy didn't know her true age. She thinks she's 14, Dee Dee said. She asked that he not upset Gypsy by claiming otherwise. Rod heeded the instruction. I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after, Rod said. She got so wound up in it, it was like a tornado got started, and then once she was in so deep that there was no escaping. One lie had to cover another lie, had to cover another lie, and that was her way of life.  They never saw all the local news stories about Dee Dee and Gypsy that had been written and filmed up in Missouri. They knew nothing of any charity drives and trips except what Dee Dee told them, which was very little. That all changed last June when Rod called Kristy, sobbing in the middle of a workday. Dee Dee's sister had called him Dee Dee was dead and Gypsy was missing. I was in hysterics thinking she got brought somewhere and was left to die, Kristy said. And if Gypsy was found, she continued, how could I take care of her when Dee Dee knew everything on how to take care of her? The first time Rod saw his daughter walk was in a news report on Gypsy's arraignment hearing in Wisconsin. No one had prepared them Kristy had spotted the video on Facebook. Rod was so confused when he saw it that he said his first reaction was, I was really happy that she was walking.  When Gypsy's attorney showed them Dee Dee's autopsy report, Kristy said she stared for a while at the portion about Dee Dee's brain. The lawyer asked her why. I want to know what the hell was going through her mind, Kristy said. What is in that brain of hers that triggered all of this shit? Dee Dee won't ever be able to answer anyone's questions. All there will be is Gypsy's story. And Gypsy doesn't know all of it herself. From the time she was arrested to my more recent talks with her in prison in Missouri, she is confused about details large and small. For example: When she was arrested, Gypsy told the police that she was 19. Rod and Kristy were able to straighten that out by giving authorities Gypsy's birth certificate. She was actually 23. Parents make your world, and Dee Dee made Gypsy's into one where she did, indeed, have cancer. Gypsy told me her mother said some of the medications were related to it. Even as she grew older, she wasn't sure how to question it. There are lingering questions, in fact, about exactly what medications Gypsy was given over the years. Some of them may never have been prescribed to Gypsy at all her attorney, for example, suspects Dee Dee gave Gypsy some kind of tranquilizer. The pile of bogus diagnoses, the confusing lists of drugs: It all points to a syndrome called Munchausen by proxy. Munchausen syndrome was first identified by a British psychiatrist named Richard Asher in 1951. A successor, Roy Meadow, identified Munchausen by proxy in 1977. It has been in the DSM, the diagnostic manual used by psychiatrists, since 1980. (In the latest version, the   it goes by the name factitious disorder, but for clarity's sake I'll stick to the Munchausen nomenclature.) In short, a person with the syndrome either feigns or induces physical and psychological symptoms for no obvious benefit other than attention and sympathy. If the person does this to themselves, it's plain Munchausen syndrome when the symptoms are feigned or induced in others, it's called Munchausen by proxy. The   recommends distinguishing Munchausen syndrome from what is called malingering, that is, faking or inducing symptoms of illness where there is some hope of material benefit. Malingering isn't considered to be a mental illness. It's just plain fraud. While most with the syndrome are mothers, there are also documented cases of fathers doing this to their children, husbands doing this to their wives, nieces doing this to their aunts. And doctors often don't detect it for months or years. In fact, it's difficult to say just how prevalent Munchausen is in the general population. By its very nature, it hides in plain sight. That doctors often miss Munchausen seems counterintuitive, but the   relationship is a bond of trust that goes both ways. As health care providers, said Caroline Burton, a doctor at the Mayo Clinic in Florida who's treated cases of Munchausen where the proxy is an adult, we rely on what a patient tells us.  Even if a doctor suspects his or her patient is lying, there isn't much incentive to refuse treatment based on the doubt. What if the doctor is wrong and the patient suffers for it? You have to be careful not to overlook organic disease, Burton said. You've really gotta go through quite a lot of diagnostic hurdles.  A diagnosis of Munchausen syndrome by proxy is attached to the perpetrator, not to the victim. Because Dee Dee is dead, it's impossible to diagnose her. She didn't leave behind a diary or some other documentation of her intentions. She did keep a binder of medical information in which she seemed to be sorting through the different information she'd given to various doctors. And she did fit certain parameters that doctors often cite as red flags for Munchausen syndrome: For example, she had some medical training. The number of doctors she took Gypsy to see over the years, and her propensity for changing locations so there was no clear medical trail, is also common. So are the concerns over sleep apnea, which is one way Munchausen often seems to begin in the various documented cases. It is also not unusual, as Burton told me, for extended family members     and even sometimes immediate ones     to be totally unaware of the feigning of illness. The perpetrators are very intelligent people, she said. They know how to manipulate other people.  They manipulate their victims, too, and the longer it goes on, the higher the chances are that the actual patient might collude with the perpetrator. The desire to please a parent can be enough to enlist a child in the deception. But even in adult cases, there can be some kind of emotional attachment keeping the patient in on the lie. The relationship that develops between the two is so unhealthy, Burton told me, of the adult cases she had treated. And no source I consulted had ever heard of a case where the abuse went on for this long, into their adulthood. One thing seems certain: For the patient in a Munchausen by proxy case, the truth becomes corroded. Gypsy's medical records are sobering. All the way back in 2001, doctors at Tulane University Hospital tested Gypsy for muscular dystrophy. Her tests came back negative. In fact, all scans of her brain and spine were relatively clear. The records of all those tests survived Katrina. Nonetheless, Dee Dee continued to insist to doctor after doctor in Louisiana and Missouri that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy. Most doctors appear from these records to have taken her assertion at face value and didn't probe. Instead they proceeded to treat Gypsy for various vision, hearing, sleep, and salivation problems that were presumed to flow from the muscular dystrophy. (The records I reviewed for this article appeared to cover only some of Gypsy's care. It's impossible to say how many other relevant records might exist.) Some interventions were surgical. Gypsy's eye muscles were repeatedly operated on for alleged weakness. Tubes were put in her ears for alleged ear infections. She was given a feeding tube and ate very little by mouth, surviving on cans of the meal replacement PediaSure well into her twenties. Her salivary glands were first injected with Botox, then removed because her mother complained that she drooled too much. Gypsy's teeth rotted out and had to be extracted, though whether that was because of poor dental hygiene or a mixture of medications and severe malnutrition, it's hard to say. The repeated invasions of Gypsy's body in the name of these illnesses she turned out not to have were, in short, serious and prolonged. It is difficult to say now whether any of it was medically needed at all. What is not difficult to say is that all of it began when Gypsy was impossibly young and could hardly have been expected to challenge authority figures     her mother or her doctors     about how she was feeling. For their part, doctors did not pick up on innumerable hints that Dee Dee's stories did not add up     not even the sleep doctor, Robert Beckerman, who saw Gypsy both in New Orleans and in Kansas City. Instead he featured his treatment of Gypsy in the hospital newsletter and mentioned repeatedly in the medical files that she and Dee Dee were his favorite mother, daughter patient.  (Beckerman did not reply to requests for comment for this story.) There was one exception. In 2007, a pediatric neurologist named Bernardo Flasterstein, consulting on the case in Springfield, became suspicious. In a recent phone conversation, Flasterstein told me he had his doubts from the first time he saw Dee Dee and Gypsy. Dee Dee's stories about Gypsy's myriad illnesses didn't fly with him. In his notes to Gypsy's primary care doctor after the first visit, he wrote, in bold, underlined type, The mother is not a good historian.  There was an unusual distribution to Gypsy's weakness for a muscular dystrophy patient, he wrote in his notes. Still, Flasterstein says, he gave the case the benefit of the doubt and sent Gypsy for all the usual tests, the MRIs and the blood work. It all came back normal. I remember having her stand up, he told me, and she could hold her own weight! He said he told Dee Dee, I don't see any reason why she doesn't walk.  In between his visits with Gypsy, Flasterstein tracked down a doctor who had seen Gypsy in New Orleans. That doctor told him that the muscle biopsy in New Orleans had been negative for muscular dystrophy, and that Gypsy's previous neurologist had explained that to Dee Dee. When confronted with the problem, Dee Dee simply stopped seeing those New Orleans doctors. Analyzing all the facts, and after talking to her previous pediatrician, Flasterstein wrote in the file, there is a strong possibility of Munchausen by proxy, with maybe some underlying unknown etiology to explain for her symptoms.  Dee Dee stopped seeing him after that visit. I assume she got my notes, Flasterstein says. He said nurses told him later that on the way out of his office on that last visit, Dee Dee was complaining that he didn't know what he was talking about. Flasterstein never followed up. He told me that in the network of Springfield doctors Dee Dee saw, everyone bought their story.  He remembers being told to treat the pair with golden gloves.  He says he thought that if he reported it to social services, they wouldn't believe him either. Thinking about it now, Flasterstein regrets not doing more. He says this was only the second case of Munchausen he'd seen in his   career. He heard about the murder when a former nurse in his office wrote him about it last year. Poor Gypsy, he told me. She suffered all those years, and for no reason.  He wishes he could have been more aggressive.  It was not the only missed opportunity for authorities to intervene. In the fall of 2009, someone made an anonymous call to the Springfield Police Department, asking for a wellness check. The person said that they had doubts that Gypsy was suffering from all the ailments her mother described. (Flasterstein says it was not he who made that call.) The police drove over to the house, but Dee Dee put their fears to rest. She told them that the reason she sometimes used inconsistent birth dates and spellings of her name was to hide from an abusive husband. No one called Rod Blanchard, or checked on these claims. The police accepted the explanation. Gypsy does suffer from some type of mental handicap, they wrote in their report. The file was closed. Gypsy also tried, once, to escape her mother. She met a man at the science fiction convention that Kim Blanchard and her husband also attended. Gypsy and this man began communicating online. At the time, in February 2011, Gypsy and Dee Dee were leaving everyone with the impression that she was 15. (She was actually 19.) According to Kim, the man in question was 35. He took Gypsy back to his hotel room. Through conventioneer intelligence     We were all overprotective of her, Kim Blanchard said     Dee Dee found them. She apparently knocked on the hotel room door with papers that showed Gypsy was a minor, and the man let Gypsy leave. (He could not be reached for comment.) After that incident, Dee Dee was furious to the point of public spectacle. She smashed the family computer with a hammer, cursed the internet to her friends. When she eventually replaced it, Gypsy was allowed to use the internet only with Dee Dee's supervision. And for months afterward, Kim Blanchard said, Gypsy was subdued, though she wasn't acting any differently than a normal child who was in trouble at that point.  The whole situation has left bystanders in Springfield with feelings of guilt. I just wish she would have come to me, Aleah Woodmansee told me. A lot of people feel that way. If Gypsy had, just once, stood up and walked across the room, the spell would have been broken. But plainly it wasn't that easy for her. In a way, that makes sense. She slipped, as people are fond of saying, through just about everyone's cracks. She had no reason to believe that her life would change. Until, apparently, she met Nick Godejohn. Under other circumstances, a tale of child abuse as long and as involved as what Gypsy experienced might have inspired public sympathy. But something about the fraud element deeply offended people, particularly those who hadn't known Gypsy or Dee Dee at all. Evidently there are a lot of people who are worried that others who are sick and disabled don't deserve their generosity. So Facebook groups began to spring up. They splintered on whether Gypsy could be said to be blamed, whether Rod and Kristy were in some way in on the fraud. Some groups ballooned to over 10, 000 members, some of them posting every day about the crime, voicing unfounded theories about what had happened. If their speculation had been confined to private forums, it might have been one thing. But more than a few of these amateur detectives were not satisfied with online discussion. They wanted to affect the case in real time. A St. Louis   based Thought Catalog writer named Meagan Pack was keeping track of tips she'd gotten from Facebook about Gypsy and Dee Dee's crimes and posting them to a   post. Pack told me she called the police detective to inform him of all she'd learned. Random observers on Facebook also called the police with their various speculations. Then, when the court hearings began, they came to those, too. One even showed up to Dee Dee's house when the initial That bitch is dead Facebook post went viral in Springfield. She hadn't known Gypsy or Dee Dee at all. She was shooed away from the crime scene by the neighbors and the police. The result was informational chaos. Kim Blanchard's GoFundMe became a flashpoint for online sleuths. When Dee Dee's financial fraud was revealed by the sheriff, Kim shut it down, but not before the groups had taken it upon themselves to investigate Kim herself. Several thought Kim and David Blanchard were lying about their involvement with Gypsy and Dee Dee, and assumed they were relatives because of their last name. Kristy Blanchard, meanwhile, was still gathering a lot of the news about her stepdaughter from Facebook. That's when she discovered that many thought she and Rod were in on Dee Dee's plans. Others thought Rod must have been a neglectful father who didn't financially support his own child. They don't understand that I've always been supportive, he said. In every way, Kristy chimed in. In fact, if anything, Dee Dee may have had so much money     Gypsy and Nick had escaped with about $4, 000 from Dee Dee's safe     because they were receiving his support checks. (Dee Dee died intestate, without a will, and apparently without meaningful assets other than that cash.) Kristy tried, at first, to defend herself and Rod to these groups, but it turned out they were hard to convince. It was hell, she said. She withdrew from all the groups and asked friends and family to stop accepting new friend requests, which were pouring in. The neighbors in Springfield also had this problem. It was like, Forget you! ' Amy Pinegar said of the few attempts she made to correct the online sleuths on their factual errors. The obsessives ended up piling confusion onto the already confusing situation Dee Dee had created. And they proved quite resilient. At the hearing I attended in September 2015, two people from the largest Facebook group were there. After the hearing, they made a beeline for the local television crew and started talking to them. Gypsy's attorney, Michael Stanfield, saw them too, and tried to hurry out of the courtroom to confront them. Who were those people? he asked the television crew. What did they say? For a while, it seemed like Gypsy's case would, eventually, go to trial. The prosecutor declined to go for the death penalty, but both Gypsy and Nick were charged with   murder. As the investigation into the crime continued, it turned up text messages between the two that appeared to discuss and plan Dee Dee's death. Honey, you forget I am ruthless, and my hatred of her will force her to die, Godejohn texted Gypsy. It's my evil side doing it. He won't mess up, because he enjoys killing.  Prosecutors also said they found social media evidence of Gypsy directly asking Godejohn to kill her mother, though these have never been made public. Documents from pretrial discovery show him telling a friend about Gypsy's desire to murder her mother as early as May 2014. Godejohn referred to his evil side because he and Gypsy had constructed an elaborate online fantasy life, mostly through a jigsaw puzzle of Facebook accounts. They were into BDSM imagery. They had specific names and roles for each other. They took pictures of themselves in costumes, Gypsy dressing up at one point as the comic book character Harley Quinn, posing with a knife. Reality and fantasy blended quite a lot, for both of them. Even now, it's not clear why Godejohn participated in this scheme. He had no history of violence. (Reached by telephone, Godejohn's attorney Andrew Mead declined to comment on the case.) His only prior arrest was for lewd conduct in 2013 at a McDonald's, where he had been watching pornography on a tablet. But both he and Gypsy told police he was the one to wield the knife. She said that while her mother was being stabbed, she was in the other room, listening. One of the taxi drivers who'd carted the pair around Springfield after the murder told interviewers they thought Gypsy was the ringleader. Gypsy's attorney, Michael Stanfield, is a public defender. In an average year, he told me, he handles over 270 individual cases. He drew Gypsy's case at random and had no idea what he was in for. I think this is probably the most complicated case I'll ever get, he said. The Greene County public defender's office was somewhat lucky, in that they were also able to pull a former leading public defender, Clate Baker, out of retirement for the case. Stanfield also had an investigator and a paralegal working on it. Kristy and Rod had no money to hire a private attorney, though they told me repeatedly as I reported this story that they would never have told Gypsy to switch attorneys because they found Stanfield so capable and reassuring. The process of figuring out what had happened was, in a word, complex. Stanfield went down to Louisiana and dredged up some elements of Dee Dee's past. It took him months to get Gypsy's own medical records, because Dee Dee had set up a power of attorney over Gypsy's medical decisions after Gypsy turned 18. The hospitals refused to help, even though the power of attorney did not surrender Gypsy's rights to look at her own medical documents. When the records finally arrived, though, they were so damning, Stanfield called the prosecutor without needing to investigate further. A plea deal was worked out. On July 5, Gypsy pleaded guilty to   murder. The judge gave her the minimum sentence: 10 years. With the year she's served, she'll be eligible for parole in about seven and a half years, at the end of 2023. By then she will be 32 years old. For his part, Godejohn is still scheduled for trial in November. It was not, Stanfield told me, a listed condition of Gypsy's plea bargain that she testify against him. At a recent hearing in   he looked bewildered and lost, a beard concealing most of his face. His family never seems to come to hearings. Gypsy is now an inmate being processed at the Women's Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Vandalia, Missouri. Her hair is long, her skin clear and healthy, and she wears proper adult glasses. She's off all her medications, and there have been no health problems in the year she's been out of her mother's control. Most of my clients lose weight in prison, Stanfield pointed out, because the food is so bad. Gypsy gained 14 pounds in the 12 months she spent in Greene County Jail before her plea. Kim Blanchard, who visited Gypsy once in jail, told me, She looked much more like the person that she was, which was the complete opposite of the person that I knew, and it was like she had a costume on that whole time and then took it off.  But obviously, there are lingering effects. When I last checked her inmate record, it still had her last name misspelled, bearing the extra e that her mother somehow thought was a good disguise. In the Greene County Jail, Gypsy had a therapist she saw once a week. It remains to be seen if she'll have one in her new home, or if that therapist will be trained to attend to the specifics of her unique situation. Rod and Kristy saw Gypsy not too long after the plea bargain. It has been a relief to know what's going to happen to her. They don't know if they're going to sue the hospitals or doctors that Gypsy saw all her life. They'll decide that after everything has settled down, after they can properly talk to Gypsy. While the case was pending, they never discussed the crime with her the prosecutor forbade it. Now there will be more to talk about. They're hoping to get up to her new facility two or three times a year. It's a long drive, and there's still the matter of money. Months ago, Rod and Kristy told me they still catch Gypsy in small lies about her life, things she's clearly afraid to be frank with them about. It worries them. Of course we want her to get better about that, Kristy said. When I spoke to them more recently, Rod's voice was sagging a little. He sounded older. He said he'd started to wonder what exactly Dee Dee had told Gypsy about him all those years. He had only begun to pose those questions. He was wondering lately, he said, how Dee Dee had managed to be so friendly on the phone all those years if she hated him so much. He asked Gypsy about it. She said, Keep your enemies close,' Gypsy told him. For most of the year I spent reporting this article, the case was pending and I wasn't able to speak to Gypsy herself. After the plea deal, that changed. I sent her a note. She called me from prison in Missouri to talk in short conversations broken up over a few days. Her voice is still   though now that we know what we know, it no longer seems unusually high at all. People heard what they wanted to. Gypsy speaks in long, beautiful sentences. She is sometimes so eloquent in conversation that it is hard to believe anyone could have ever spoken with her and thought her slow, as some put it. It reminded me of all the doctors who wrote in her files that in spite of Gypsy's alleged cognitive defect, she had a rich vocabulary.  She was eager to talk, barely able to contain herself once she started. She wants people to know, she said, that this wasn't a situation where a girl killed her mom to be with her boyfriend. This was a situation, she said, of a girl trying to escape abuse. In prison she's hoping to join all sorts of programs, to help people. She wants to write a book to help others in her situation. I asked her what I'd long been waiting to ask her: When did she realize her life was different, that there was something wrong? Whenever I was 19, she said. She meant the time when she ran away with the man at the convention in 2011. When her mother came to take her back, she began to wonder why she wasn't allowed to be alone, to have friends. About her mother, her opinion seems to waver. The doctors thought that she was so devoted and caring, Gypsy said. I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick. But I'm not sick. There's that big, big difference.  Gypsy still doesn't feel she actively deceived anyone. I feel like I was just as used as everybody else, she said. She used me as a pawn. I was in the dark about it. The only thing I knew was that I could walk, and that I could eat. As for everything else       Well, she'd shave my hair off. And she'd say, It's gonna fall out anyway, so let's keep it nice and neat! ' Gypsy said her mother told her she had cancer, too, and would tell her that her medication was cancer medication. She just accepted it. As for a childlike demeanor, Gypsy grew defensive when I asked her about it. It's not my fault. I can't help it. This is my voice.  Often, it didn't occur to her to question any of it, and when it did, she worried about hurting her mother's feelings. It often seems to Gypsy, even now, that Dee Dee really thought she was sick. I was afraid that we were gonna get in trouble, Gypsy said. The line between right and wrong      was kinda blurred, 'cause that's the way I was taught. I just grew up that way.  When I think about it now, she added, I wish I would have reached out to somebody and told somebody before I told Nick.  She mostly used the internet late at night, when her mother was asleep. Nick, she said, was the first person who had offered her real protection. She believed him. Ultimately, after everything that happened, she said she thinks he has anger issues.  She repeatedly takes responsibility for the murder: What I did was wrong. I'll have to live with it.  But she said Nick is the one who took a plot between us both and made it into action.  Gypsy was the one who had the idea to post about the murder on Facebook, so that the police would come check on her mom. She recalled asking Nick, Can we please just post something on Facebook, something alarming, that would make people call the police? But she said he told her what to write. I asked, repeatedly: Are you angry? With your mom? With the doctors? She will admit only to frustration. It makes me frustrated that none of the other doctors could see that I was perfectly healthy. That my legs were not skinny, like someone who was [really] paralyzed. That I can't       I don't need a feeding tube. Stuff like that.  In jail, Gypsy had access to tablet computers. She looked up the definition of Munchausen, after hearing the word so often used to describe her situation. Her mother matched every symptom, she told me. Every once in a while, I'd get Gypsy explaining some element of her abuse in such detail that something in me would break. Once, feeling speechless but aware that the clock was ticking on her phone time, I blurted out, I'm so sorry this happened to you.  Gypsy immediately switched into the girl she was back in those   local news interviews. It's okay. I mean, honestly, it's made me a stronger person, because I truly believe that everything happens for a reason.  Even on the subject of her prison sentence, Gypsy is a model of radical acceptance. She's told people she feels freer in prison than she did when living with her mom. This time is good for me, she said to me. I've been raised to do what my mother taught me to do. And those things aren't very good.  She taught me to lie, and I don't wanna lie. I want to be a good, honest person.     "

","'Watch the full speech here:'] Trump unveiled his   immigration policy Wednesday night in a   speech, vowing to intensify the deportation of undocumented immigrants and build a wall along the southern border. “There will be no amnesty,” Trump said in Phoenix, outlining a   plan that focused on deportations, increasing manpower at the border, and tightening visa regulations. Trump rolled out the plan Wednesday at a rally in Phoenix, saying the US should take “our forgotten working people” into consideration. The speech came just hours after Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto south of the border, where the two said they had a direct and constructive talk about immigration and their contributions to both sides of the border. But Trump took on a different tone in his speech Wednesday night, linking crime and immigration and stating that his focus would be on criminal immigrants. “My first hour in office, those people are gone. You can call it whatever the hell you want, they're gone,” Trump said. “The crime will stop   they are going home. ” If his Democratic rival Clinton is elected, Trump warned the crowd, “the result will be millions of more illegal immigrants, thousands of more violent crimes and total chaos and lawlessness. ” He also suggested Clinton would be among the deportees. “Maybe they'll be able to deport her,” he said. The Republican nominee said previous attempts at an immigration overhaul in the US have failed because of   politicians and special interests. “When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages,” Trump said. “Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. ” Like he's done at previous rallies, Trump also listed crimes committed by undocumented immigrants in the US, and at the end of his speech invited the relatives of victims of immigrants in the country illegally. The speech had been   after the Republican indicated he might be open to “softening” his stance on immigration controls. He then later said he had not changed his mind on the strict proposals he promoted during his campaign. Instead, Trump said the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country would not be allowed to stay unless they returned to their country of origin and begin the process of entering legally. “Our message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the USA by illegally entering our country,” Trump said. “People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized,” he said. “Those days are over. ” The policy introduced by Trump Wednesday night was based on a   plan, which he outlined as building a border wall, detaining and deporting anyone trying to illegally cross the border, deporting undocumented criminal immigrants, blocking funding of “sanctuary cities,” rolling back protections offered to the children of immigrants brought at a young age, and vetting people trying to come to the US. “It's going to be so tough, and if someone comes in that's fine, but they're going to be good,” Trump said. “Very few will slip through the cracks, hopefully none. ” Trump has previously said he would form a deportation task force to remove the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. And a hallmark of his campaign has been his proposal to build a wall along the border and force Mexico to pay for it. After meeting with Peña Nieto on Wednesday, Trump said the two discussed the wall, but not the issue of who would pay for it. “We didn't discuss that,” Trump told reporters after the meeing. However, Peña Nieto tweeted that the issue was indeed discussed at the beginning of the   meeting, and that he told Trump Mexico would not pay for it. Trump's campaign then issued a statement saying the two men “hold two different views on this issue. ” Trump also adopted a different tone in Phoenix than he did after meeting with Peña Nieto, telling a rowdy crowd of supporters in Phoenix that Mexico would pay for the wall. “They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for the wall,” Trump said. Despite past suggestions that Trump might consider some sort of immigration policy that would address millions of people living in the US, Trump appeared to put an end to that speculation. “All energies of the federal government and legislative process must be focused on immigration security,” he said. “That is the only conversation we should be having at this time. ”   ",False,"'Watch the full speech here:'] Trump unveiled his   immigration policy Wednesday night in a   speech, vowing to intensify the deportation of undocumented immigrants and build a wall along the southern border.

Daniel   pleaded guilty to two counts of   criminal sexual conduct stemming for two sexual assaults  —   one which occurred in 2014 on Halloween in his fraternity's laundry room, and one that occurred a week later at his apartment. “It's a relief I can walk the world a bit more freely now,”  's second victim  —   who agreed to be identified by her first name, Abby  —   told BuzzFeed News Wednesday. “It's going to be a huge relief to be a person a again. ” In her impact statement, which she read in court, Abby detailed the night of the assault.

158,73595,110139, Campaign Launched To Support Judge In Stanford Sex Assault Case,Buzzfeed News,Claudia Koerner,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiakoerner/campaign-launched-to-support-judge-in-stanford-sex-assault-c
"," A political campaign has launched to support Judge Aaron Persky, whose decision to sentence former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman sparked protests and a recall effort. Persky recently asked to be transferred from criminal cases to a position in civil court. The move was welcomed by his critics, but organizers seeking a recall said they continue to believe Persky is biased and should be removed from the bench. By Wednesday, a campaign had launched in support of Persky and his position. Retain Judge Persky has registered with California election officials, and Palo Alto Online reported that the judge had posted a list of attorneys who had donated in his courtroom to comply with the state judicial ethics code. In a statement on the Retain Judge Persky website, the judge offered some of his first comments on the Turner controversy. “I believe strongly in judicial independence,” Persky said. “I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, not to appease politicians or ideologues. When your own rights and property are at stake, you want the judge to make a fair and lawful decision, free from political influence. ” Persky and campaign organizers did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. The sentencing of Turner drew national attention in June after BuzzFeed News published a powerful letter written by the victim on how the crime had affected her. Though sentencing guidelines recommend a minimum sentence of two years for the crime, Persky ordered Turner to six months in jail because the teen appeared to show “genuine remorse. ” Turner is expected to be released Friday after serving half that time. Since then, advocacy groups have staged protests, and an online petition to remove Persky from the bench garnered more than 1 million signatures. A formal recall effort is underway, and scrutiny has come onto other cases where Persky has presided and delivered what critics call unusually lenient sentences. Persky has been a judge within the Santa Clara County Superior Court system for 12 years and previously served as a prosecutor. The campaign website also links to statements from retired superior court judges who support Persky, as well as a statement from the California Judges Association. Judges must work freely of fear from public opinion, the association said in its statement, first published in June. Persky is only one example of a judge who has experienced fierce criticism and even threats, the group said. “If a party believes a judge made a wrong decision, that party may appeal the decision,” the statement said. “It does harm to our constitutional system, however, to place judges in fear of recall or personal harm before making unpopular decisions that comply with the law. ”   ",False," A political campaign has launched to support Judge Aaron Persky, whose decision to sentence former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman sparked protests and a recall effort. Persky recently asked to be transferred from criminal cases to a position in civil court. The move was welcomed by his critics, but organizers seeking a recall said they continue to believe Persky is biased and should be removed from the bench. By Wednesday, a campaign had launched in support of Persky and his position. Retain Judge Persky has registered with California election officials, and Palo Alto Online reported that the judge had posted a list of attorneys who had donated in his courtroom to comply with the state judicial ethics code. In a statement on the Retain Judge Persky website, the judge offered some of his first comments on the Turner controversy. I believe strongly in judicial independence, Persky said. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, not to appease politicians or ideologues. When your own rights and property are at stake, you want the judge to make a fair and lawful decision, free from political influence.  Persky and campaign organizers did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. The sentencing of Turner drew national attention in June after BuzzFeed News published a powerful letter written by the victim on how the crime had affected her. Though sentencing guidelines recommend a minimum sentence of two years for the crime, Persky ordered Turner to six months in jail because the teen appeared to show genuine remorse.  Turner is expected to be released Friday after serving half that time. Since then, advocacy groups have staged protests, and an online petition to remove Persky from the bench garnered more than 1 million signatures. A formal recall effort is underway, and scrutiny has come onto other cases where Persky has presided and delivered what critics call unusually lenient sentences. Persky has been a judge within the Santa Clara County Superior Court system for 12 years and previously served as a prosecutor. The campaign website also links to statements from retired superior court judges who support Persky, as well as a statement from the California Judges Association. Judges must work freely of fear from public opinion, the association said in its statement, first published in June. Persky is only one example of a judge who has experienced fierce criticism and even threats, the group said. If a party believes a judge made a wrong decision, that party may appeal the decision, the statement said. It does harm to our constitutional system, however, to place judges in fear of recall or personal harm before making unpopular decisions that comply with the law.    "

FBI agents found parts for an   assault rifle, ammunition, magazines, and quantities of chemical material that “can be used to create explosives and incendiaries” at the home of Joseph Garguilo, 48, according to an affidavit filed in federal court. Federal agents also said they found handwritten notes at Garguilo's home “threatening violence against members of the Islamic religion,” according to the affidavit. Garguilo, who lives in Holliston, a town 30 miles southwest of Boston, appeared in federal court on Monday and was charged with being a “prohibited person in possession of ammunition”  —   allegedly in violation of a restraining order placed on Garguilo by his   in June, according to charging documents. In a press release on Monday, the US Attorney's Office in Massachusetts said the charges, if found guilty, carry “a sentence of no greater than 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250, 000,” but added that “actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. ” According to court documents, the FBI received a tip on July 27 about Garguilo from a woman, identified as Witness 1 in the affidavit, who claimed she was worried about Garguilo because he was “stockpiling food water and other weapons, to include tasers, mace guns, hunting knives and thermite,” a chemical compound that can be used to make explosives. Witness 1 told the FBI that Garguilo “hates gays, minorities, and the police” and that “he will plant bombs in police stations  …     and kill as many homeland security officers as he can before they kill him,” according to court documents. She also said that Garguilo believes the “structure of America will collapse” and “enter a state of martial law. ” The Boston Globe wrote that Witness 1 is Garguilo's   and has obtained restraining order against him on two occasions, in 2009 and again in June. Garguilo's attorney, Mark R. Meehan, told reporters outside the federal courthouse that “there's a long history of false allegations on behalf of the mother of his children,” insinuating that the allegations against Garguilo are related to “ongoing custody issues” involving the couple's children. Another individual, identified in the affidavit as Witness 2, claims to have been to Garguilo's home recently and has seen a “partially assembled   crossbow and knives,” and stated that Garguilo wants “to attack a mosque   kill Obama. ” Specifically, it is alleged that Garguilo said he should have killed Obama while on the golf course on a recent trip to Martha's Vineyard. Witness 2, who is described as a childhood friend, also recalled a conversation with Garguilo where he allegedly expressed a desire to “chain a mosque closed and burn it down” and “burn every motherfucker down in there. ” Witness 1 alleges that Garguilo has a history of drug use and might be using drugs again, while Witness 2 said they believed that Garguilo was using steroids because his muscle mass increased in a short period of time.

"," WASHINGTON  —   The North Carolina voting restrictions struck down by a federal appeals court earlier this summer will remain off the books for November's election, following a Supreme Court order on Wednesday. The closely divided justices denied North Carolina Gov Pat McCrory's request to halt enforcement of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals decision striking down five voting restrictions while the state seeks Supreme Court review of the decision. Among the provisions in the law that the appeals court has ordered the state not to enforce are limits on the type of photo ID required for voting reductions to the amount of early voting in the state and elimination of   registration,    provisional voting, and preregistration that allowed   and    to indicate an intent to register when they turned 18. McCrory asked that the justices allow the state to enforce three of those provisions  —   the voter ID provision, the reduction in early voting, and the elimination of the preregistration  —   this election while seeking Supreme Court review of the 4th Circuit's ruling. The Obama administration and organizations that had sued the state over the law opposed the stay request. Justice Clarence Thomas would have granted the stay as to all three provisions. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito would have granted the stay as to all of the provisions except for the preregistration provision  —   which would have had little to no effect at this point on this year's eligible voters. In other words, as to the voter ID and early voting parts of the law, there was a   split on whether to grant McCrory's request and allow the state to enforce those provisions this fall. It takes a majority of the court to grant a stay, however, which meant that five justices would have needed to have voted for a stay in order for it to be granted. Notably, no justice provided a   “courtesy” fifth vote in support of the stay request  —   a move that Justice Stephen Breyer did take earlier this month when a the case of a transgender student presented the same scenario: four justices willing to vote for a stay, which is all that would be needed for the court to take the appeal when the cert petition is before the justices but not enough justices to grant a stay while that appeal is decided. In such circumstances, a justice can  —   as Breyer did in the earlier case  —   provide a “courtesy” fifth vote in order to allow for a stay while the cert petition can be considered. On Wednesday, however, none of the four other justices  —   Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan  —   did so, leaving the 4th Circuit's injunction against North Carolina's voting restrictions in place. In a statement, McCrory took aim at his opponent for the governorship, Attorney General Roy Cooper, along with the “four liberal justices” voting against McCrory's request. “North Carolina has been denied basic voting rights already granted to more than 30 other states to protect the integrity of one person, one vote through a   voter ID law,” McCrory said in the statement. “Even without any support from our state's attorney general, we were pleased that four justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, agreed with this right while four liberal justices blocked North Carolina protections afforded by our sensible voter laws. ” 			North Carolina Gov Pat McCrory's request before the Supreme Court related only to three of the five provisions of the law at issue.

"," SAN MIGUEL DEL PUERTO, Mexico  —   Many Mexican children went back to school last week after a bloody summer that saw at least eight people killed and nearly a hundred injured as a    fight over a sweeping education overhaul turned violent. Thousands remained without classes to attend, their teachers still away on strike. A radical offshoot of the teachers union, the National Coordinator of Education Workers (CNTE) has been tussling with the government since 2012 in an effort to quash the reform, which seeks to get rid of   educators, all the while tearing apart towns and even families. The latest upheaval comes as the country begins implementing President Enrique Peña Nieto's education overhaul program, which introduced a   evaluation for hiring, promoting, and firing teachers. The evaluation system, which does away with the   practice of selling and inheriting teaching positions, is an outrage in the eyes of the CNTE. Lizbeth Santiago woke up just ahead of the school term three years ago, shortly before the reform was approved, to find herself caught up in the strife currently roiling the region, her life totally changed. When a group of frustrated parents in San Miguel del Puerto warned the   teachers not to go on a strike, they refused. So, the parents locked up the school and then hired new, but   teacher trainees to replace the CNTE teachers. As a result, the CNTE teachers no longer had a school to teach in when they returned from their protests, they instead set up a makeshift school in the home of one of the teachers. Since then, Santiago's hometown has been divided over which school they should be loyal to  —   the new makeshift school with union teachers who kept abandoning classes to organize strikes or the old school where parents took matters in their hands and hired   trainees who prioritize classrooms over protests. Most chose to keep their children in the old school, but some, like Santiago, opted for the new one. Almost overnight, her parents stopped talking to her, her neighbors started dodging her gaze, and her    daughter was no longer welcome at kids' gatherings. “This is like living in hell,” Santiago told BuzzFeed News. The schism that pummeled   relationships in this isolated, mountainside hamlet of 2, 500 people repeated itself across Oaxaca State over the last three years, putting on display the growing resentment toward the strikes by the CNTE, which ordered many schools closed even as the new school year began. And yet, the CNTE's tactics have worked, to some extent. Last week, education authorities announced that evaluations will, through the remainder of 2016, only be required for the 24, 000 teachers who performed poorly on last year's tests. The government planned to evaluate about 150, 000 of the country's 1. 4 million teachers during its first round of testing last year, though only about 134, 000 agreed to take the tests. The aggressive push by the CNTE to water down the reform has put the government on the defensive, with analysts warning that their protests will further diminish the governing party's popularity and harm its chances in the next elections. If you want to understand what's wrong with the education system in Mexico, you only have to look at Elba Esther Gordillo, who for decades was the face of Mexico's public education and the most powerful woman in the country  —   and now sits in jail. Gordillo's face is striking  —   her eyebrows shoot up in a deep V and her lips almost always appear frozen in an angry frown. Many in Mexico have compared her, in jest, to Chucky, the antagonist in the horror film Child's Play. Gordillo is also known for her voracious appetite for designer clothes and love of real estate: She is believed to have spent more than $2 million at Neiman Marcus, the upscale department store, and she owned several mansions in San Diego, California. According to an investigation by Nexos magazine, she traveled frequently in a private plane that flew nearly 430, 000 miles between 2005 and 2013. As the head of the teachers union, Gordillo ran the country's public schools and essentially controlled hiring. The union, with its 1. 2 million members, is the largest and most powerful in Latin America, and for years held de facto control over the Education Ministry. Gordillo at one point was so powerful that her support of one presidential candidate over another coulddetermine elections, as she could deliver hundreds of thousands of unionworkers' votes. Meanwhile, the quality of education in Mexico took a hit. In 2012, the Organisation for Economic   and Development revealed that more than half the students in the public education system could not pass basic competency tests in mathematics. Shortly after assuming office in 2013, Peña Nieto signed a sweeping education reform into law. It transferred power from the union to the federal government, established periodic evaluations for teachers, instituted workshops for educators, and allocated resources to improve infrastructure, especially in some of the poorest corners of the country. The reform spurred huge protests, with members of the CNTE attacking local government offices, temporarily closing down the main boulevard in Mexico City, and at one point blocking access to the airport. The teachers “come and talk to us about education, but what education are they talking about when our children turn the TV on and see the disasters they are creating on the street?” said Marisol, a mother and member of the Head of Families Committee in San Miguel del Puerto. One of the biggest sticking points for CNTE members, many of whom have not taken teaching courses in decades, is the periodic evaluation. They say it puts teachers from impoverished and isolated regions at a disadvantage. Some of the schools in these areas have limited access to electricity, take hours to reach on foot, and cater to indigenous communities who still communicate in their native language. Supporters of the reform say it was long overdue. The CNTE “is holding education hostage,” said Lizbeth Rodríguez, a teacher who accuses the group of placing its political interests before children's education. “It's delinquency,” she added. Rodríguez, who teaches at the original school in San Miguel del Puerto, had just finished college about 15 years ago when her friend, a physical education teacher at a public school in Oaxaca, told her he knew someone who could get her a job. His offer, however, came at a price: She could pay $150, 000 pesos or get a discount of $20, 000 if she had sex with him, Rodríguez remembers him saying. “I couldn't believe how far things had gone,” she said. What Rodríguez experienced was not uncommon, an employee at the Education Ministry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be identified admitting the embarrassing practice existed, confirmed to BuzzFeed News. Aspiring teachers could for years also rent or inherit their permanent positions at schools around the country. Teachers suspended classes on a whim, often because they wanted to attend protests. Shortly after lawmakers passed the reform, Gordillo was investigated and jailed on suspicion of embezzlement and tax fraud. When teachers returned to San Miguel del Puerto after a   protest in the winter of 2013, they found the school gates locked and a group of parents huddled at the entrance. The parents, who had warned them to reconsider their strike earlier in the year, started firing flares, a signal to call other parents for backup. Within minutes, dozens of parents came together to physically prevent the teachers from entering the school. Many parents said they felt more disrespected and disillusioned when the teachers left despite their pleas and warnings. Their children spent more time at home than in classrooms and the parents feared their sons and daughters were falling irreparably behind. “We've seen it with ourselves. I don't want my daughter to suffer like I have. I want her to better herself,” said Marisol. Weeks before the teachers returned, Marcial Vázquez, a father of two kids, convinced about 100 angry parents to hire new teacher trainees from nearby communities. They even decided to donate a few dollars a month to pay for the trainees' food and commute. Gabriela Canseco, one of the CNTE teachers, was shocked when she returned from the protest. They'd always had control over the town's schools and students  —   but not anymore. “I wanted to pack my bags and go,” Canseco said. But she decided not to give up. So she set up a school in her living room, where the bright blue walls are now covered with unintelligible pencil marks. Like evangelists, Vázquez and Canseco started going door to door, trying to convince undecided parents to send their children to their competing schools. Canseco reminded them that the CNTE school was the only officially recognized school in town and, therefore, the only one that offered students certification after they passed. Vázquez sought out twentysomethings like Santiago to teach at the old school. In a region with few real job opportunities  —   many of the men here have left for the US and those who stayed behind are subsistence farmers  —   the offer was tempting. Meanwhile, people slowly grew accustomed to passing neighbors on the quiet, undulating roads without exchanging a word. In the neighborhoods, they engaged in gossip about whose children had   school supplies and which school threw the best     parties. Soon, parents said children who attended rival schools began bullying each other. Kids who continued attending the original school warned each other not to speak with their friends at the new school. Parents too felt like they were being pulled in different directions. Monica Mijangos, who sends her three children to the old school, said she felt like “a weird animal” when she went to her godson's birthday party, where everyone ignored her because they were affiliated with the new school. Santiago refused Vázquez's offer to teach at the old school. She said she was appalled that he and other parents were willing to replace experienced teachers with unprepared teacher trainees. Parents at the old school have asked the Oaxaca teachers union, which has been more open to the reform than the national CNTE group, to send the town salaried teachers who have passed the evaluation as proposed in the reform. But none of the parents here, including Santiago, know what exactly the evaluation measures. And like most parents, she remains protective about her decision. “Everyone,” she said, “is free to do as they please with their kids. ”   ",False," SAN MIGUEL DEL PUERTO, Mexico     Many Mexican children went back to school last week after a bloody summer that saw at least eight people killed and nearly a hundred injured as a    fight over a sweeping education overhaul turned violent. Thousands remained without classes to attend, their teachers still away on strike. A radical offshoot of the teachers union, the National Coordinator of Education Workers (CNTE) has been tussling with the government since 2012 in an effort to quash the reform, which seeks to get rid of   educators, all the while tearing apart towns and even families. The latest upheaval comes as the country begins implementing President Enrique Pea Nieto's education overhaul program, which introduced a   evaluation for hiring, promoting, and firing teachers. The evaluation system, which does away with the   practice of selling and inheriting teaching positions, is an outrage in the eyes of the CNTE. Lizbeth Santiago woke up just ahead of the school term three years ago, shortly before the reform was approved, to find herself caught up in the strife currently roiling the region, her life totally changed. When a group of frustrated parents in San Miguel del Puerto warned the   teachers not to go on a strike, they refused. So, the parents locked up the school and then hired new, but   teacher trainees to replace the CNTE teachers. As a result, the CNTE teachers no longer had a school to teach in when they returned from their protests, they instead set up a makeshift school in the home of one of the teachers. Since then, Santiago's hometown has been divided over which school they should be loyal to     the new makeshift school with union teachers who kept abandoning classes to organize strikes or the old school where parents took matters in their hands and hired   trainees who prioritize classrooms over protests. Most chose to keep their children in the old school, but some, like Santiago, opted for the new one. Almost overnight, her parents stopped talking to her, her neighbors started dodging her gaze, and her    daughter was no longer welcome at kids' gatherings. This is like living in hell, Santiago told BuzzFeed News. The schism that pummeled   relationships in this isolated, mountainside hamlet of 2, 500 people repeated itself across Oaxaca State over the last three years, putting on display the growing resentment toward the strikes by the CNTE, which ordered many schools closed even as the new school year began. And yet, the CNTE's tactics have worked, to some extent. Last week, education authorities announced that evaluations will, through the remainder of 2016, only be required for the 24, 000 teachers who performed poorly on last year's tests. The government planned to evaluate about 150, 000 of the country's 1. 4 million teachers during its first round of testing last year, though only about 134, 000 agreed to take the tests. The aggressive push by the CNTE to water down the reform has put the government on the defensive, with analysts warning that their protests will further diminish the governing party's popularity and harm its chances in the next elections. If you want to understand what's wrong with the education system in Mexico, you only have to look at Elba Esther Gordillo, who for decades was the face of Mexico's public education and the most powerful woman in the country     and now sits in jail. Gordillo's face is striking     her eyebrows shoot up in a deep V and her lips almost always appear frozen in an angry frown. Many in Mexico have compared her, in jest, to Chucky, the antagonist in the horror film Child's Play. Gordillo is also known for her voracious appetite for designer clothes and love of real estate: She is believed to have spent more than $2 million at Neiman Marcus, the upscale department store, and she owned several mansions in San Diego, California. According to an investigation by Nexos magazine, she traveled frequently in a private plane that flew nearly 430, 000 miles between 2005 and 2013. As the head of the teachers union, Gordillo ran the country's public schools and essentially controlled hiring. The union, with its 1. 2 million members, is the largest and most powerful in Latin America, and for years held de facto control over the Education Ministry.

165,73602,110149, Meet North Korea's Number One Fan In The United States,Buzzfeed News,Beimeng Fu,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/beimengfu/meet-north-koreas-number-one-fan-in-the-united-states
"," LOS ANGELES  —   The heart of Koreatown was still hot as night fell in early June. Inside a ballroom on the second floor of a   hotel, a white banner with Korean words revealed the night's theme: “Discussion between fellow countrymen in the U. S. on peace and unification. ” Ken Roh, 72, was wearing an old,   suit and a bright   tie, and stood greeting the three dozen people who drove from all over the city to see him, a veteran reporter who built his career defending one of the most secretive countries in the world: North Korea. The audience sat straight up, focused, eager to hear about what Roh had seen and heard during a recent    trip to the country and its neighboring areas in China  —   his 69th visit to the country officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It's become a tradition over the past decade  —   two to three times each year, the same group of   fans gather, eat Korean food, chat, and wait for the good news brought back firsthand from what they believe is the ideal society. On that June night, Roh started off by triumphantly displaying on a TV screen a Washington Post article that told the story of the two   sons of a former American GI who defected to North Korea in 1962. The article, which detailed their continued loyalty to North Korea, relied on a video of an interview that Roh had done with the two men while in North Korea and had uploaded to the YouTube channel of the news site he founded over a decade ago, Minjok Tongshin. Roh appeared in the video himself, and it has since garnered around 20, 000 views, making it his most watched video ever. He shared his pride with the crowd twice, once in Korean, and another in his    English, telling them he regarded the interview and its subsequent appearance in a huge national newspaper as his “number one good job” during the visit. The audience applauded. “It was a moving interview,” Roh said, as someone stood on a chair and took a photo of the room. While everyone else in the world sees North Korea as the home of gulags, starvation, and aggressive missile tests, the South Korean émigrés gathered in the ballroom see the country as a     motherland, even if, technically, it's still at war with South Korea despite an armistice signed in 1953. This is the pro —  North Korea community in the U. S. whose interests are at odds with the country they've made their home  —   on Wednesday, July 6, for the first time, the U. S. sanctioned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for human rights abuses. From the outside, everything about the community, from how it emerged, to how far it is willing to carry its commitment to North Korea, is puzzling. Roh and his followers, listening intently to the gospel delivered straight from Pyongyang, offer a window into how North Korea's ideology spreads under the radar on U. S. soil, and, ultimately, just how people decide what to believe in. Roh's house sits along a main road in Glendale, surrounded by vibrant flowers like daylilies and blue jacarandas with an open view of the   Verdugo Mountains. It's nearly 6, 000 miles away from Gangneung, the northeastern coastal city in South Korea where Roh was born in 1944, when the Korean Peninsula was in its last years of Japanese colonial rule. The split that divided the two into a   north and U. S.  south was never meant to be permanent both countries on the Korean Peninsula want to see an end to the status quo, and talks about reunification has been on top of the agenda for decades. The horror of the Korean War  —   and the inability of North and South to decide what a rejoined government would look like  —   set the divide firmly into place. These days, the biggest obstacle the tens of thousands of divided families face, according to the Brookings Institute, is “North Korea itself. ” When Roh was young, though, the Cold War was still in full swing and neither side was particularly admirable. “As soon as I graduated [from South Korea's elite Yonsei University] I was trying to find a way to run away from the South Korean territory to pursue the freedom of expression,” Roh said, describing how publicly criticizing the government could lead to jailing under   Park Chung Hee. When Roh was still at school, however, he couldn't stay away from politics  —   as the    of the campus   newspaper, he once surveyed his classmates on how they felt about the government. (  percent responded negatively he said the school cut his scholarship afterward.) He became a student activist against the Park dictatorship, but saw no hope for democratization in South Korea and, after a few years saving up money, decided to come to the USA. It was 1973. “At that time I thought that USA was number one democratic country, number one social justice —  oriented country,” Roh said. But during his years at the University of Texas as an urban sociology student, he changed his mind. “I started to know what is jingoism, what is the civil rights movement in the U. S. A. ,” he said in his somewhat stilted English, pointing to the struggle of black Americans and racist laws targeting Chinese immigrants in the 18th century. “I didn't know before I came here. I started to open my consciousness [and] become critical,” he said. Even with the constant threat of renewed conflict, for a long time, Roh gave North Korea no thought, maintaining his focus on democratization in South Korea, where oppressive governments remained in power until the late 1980s through U. S. support as a counter to Pyongyang and communist China. “Just once in awhile [I thought to myself] Why divided?” he recalled. Upon completing his degree, he moved to L. A. and worked for a few local Korean community newspapers. After seeing his articles being thrown out, he says, he quit. North Korea caught Roh's attention for the first time in 1989, when he heard news that several   South Korean dissidents had taken unauthorized trips to Pyongyang as an unofficial way to promote reunification. The trips sparked a new wave of national turmoil in South Korea  —   the country was dealing with the aftermath of its drastic social transition from an authoritarian state to a democracy. For Roh, the idea of entering North Korea at all seemed like a revelation. The next year, he traveled to North Korea for the first time as an organizing member of a “  rally for reunification,” the first free border crossing agreed to by the two governments since their division in 1945. Until then, Roh said, he was under the influence of a “Western way of thinking” and thought Kim Il Sung, North Korea's first leader, was a dictator. But the visit, he said, changed everything. After the rally in Panmunjom, a village north of the 2.   demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates the two countries and where the armistice that paused the Korean War was signed, 15 participants, including Roh and three other Korean émigrés, were unexpectedly whisked away and driven to a beautiful villa. Kim Il Sung walked out and greeted them personally they had been chosen to share a meal with the Great Leader. Roh remembered Kim's secretary saying, “This is the first time he came out in front of the house. Usually [he's] inside  —   this is unusual. ” “I was scared,” Roh said, “but he made us very comfortable. ” Roh recalled the moment when he began to sympathize with Kim, as the North Korean leader described how hard it was to establish the country, counting only “seven to eight intellectuals” among his leadership's ranks. By the end of the banquet, when a symbolic course of “black, rotten potatoes” like those that were the only thing available during World War II and the Korean War were served, Kim had won Roh over. “My feeling is [that] he's like a grandfather,” Roh said. “My grandfather. ” Roh's interest in North Korea continued once he got back to the U. S. Over the years, he collected the eight volumes of the elder Kim's memoir, With the Century, and memorized them by heart. He's a big believer in North Korea's official ideology, juche, Korean for “” also known as Kimilsungism. And he took a more active role promoting reunification the way he knew best, by writing. But this time he wanted his own publication. He couldn't afford to print a newspaper, but the younger brother of a friend, who was working as an internet developer at the time, offered him something he'd never thought of: a website. “Mr. Roh, why don't you operate internet news?” Roh said the young man asked him one day in 1998, when the internet wasn't yet a popular primary news source (the websites of the Los Angeles Times and the NY Times had launched just three years earlier). Minjok Tongshin, Korean for “National Communication,” debuted on Nov. 11, 1999. Today, Roh updates the site daily and manages nine other members of the editorial staff, all of whom are volunteers who get only symbolic salaries  —   no more than $100 a month each, former editorial staff member Rev. Joseph Paik confirmed in a phone interview. Roh says that the operating funds for the website all come from small offline donations from   throughout the country: Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Baltimore, D. C. and NY. People in South Korea sometimes send him money too, he said. “Of course many times [we have had a] shortage,” Roh said, but money, he says, has never been his top concern. Roh has maintained a series of side jobs, including selling encyclopedias, in which he brought his substantial persuasive abilities to bear, earning enough to buy property in Koreatown. The website's angle hits you right in the face  —   the U. S. is referred to as “imperialist America,” and calls South Korean President Park Geun Hye's government “oppressive. ” (Her father is Park Chung Hee, the former military dictator whose policies Roh spent the early part of his life protesting.) Meanwhile, it dwells on the good deeds of the “Supreme Leader” Kim Jong Un and cites articles from the Korean Central News Agency and other North Korean   media. South Korea blocked Minjok Tongshin in 2004. Roh considers it a success, claiming a monthly readership of 2 to 3 million, though a typical article gets only a few hundred views. (A review of traffic analytics websites shows that, in reality, Minjok Tongshin gets an average of about 20, 000 visits per month, whereas   community newspaper Korea Times gets about 1, 600, 000. After confronting Roh with the number, he insisted a conservative number of 1 million was accurate, if including social media and email subscribers  —   but the site has only about 1, 000 Twitter followers and 600 YouTube subscribers.) After that first visit, Roh continued to travel to Pyongyang every year, soon becoming a trustworthy comrade of the North Korean regime, gaining rare access to the country. He once shook hands with the country's current president Kim Jong Un, offering condolences for the death of Kim Jong Il, Kim's father and predecessor. He also claims that the Foreign Ministry is at his disposal to set up interviews upon request, as long as he submits a list of questions they deem appropriate. That's how he was able to reach the sons of the American who defected to North Korea, for the interview that landed him in the Post. He met their father, James Joseph Dresnok, years ago through an exchange of cigarettes, when the two English speakers were both hospitalized in Pyongyang Friendship Hospital. Roh wanted to meet with him during his latest visit, but officials told him Dresnok was too sick. Undeterred, he suggested to officials that he could at least catch up with his friend's sons. The government granted his request after reviewing the required list of questions. Roh's work on Minjok has won the heart of the North Korean government: In 2008, he got a Ph. D. in political science from Kim Il Sung University. In 2014, the government awarded him the Kim Il Sung Prize, which is “a very significant award to get from the DPRK,” Michael Madden, a visiting scholar at the U. S.  Institute, told BuzzFeed News. “Obviously something has been done to the attention to the supreme leadership of North Korea who usually signs off on the document authorizing the prize. ” The government treated Roh with a reception for the prize, which comes with a certificate and a   medallion. In the official certificate, he was addressed somewhat awkwardly as the “Representative of Korean American Internet Newspaper. ” Roh, who was in North Korea for one of his reporting trips, claimed he had no idea the award was coming: “They didn't tell me in advance and I only knew as a surprise. ” Roh's deep involvement and access has obviously raised some eyebrows. “I think he's funded and supported by North Korean government,” said Seoungmin Lee, a defector who is currently enrolled at Columbia University. “Just look at it, he's supporting North Korea and delivering the messages to the outside world  —   otherwise why would he do that. ” Roh admits that Minjok Tongshin is a pro —  North Korea organization, but denies that he's controlled by the North Korean government. “One hundred percent [of our funds come] from overseas   [including] even a small percent of funds from South Korea,” he said. Minjok Tongshin, however, is not the only organization in the USA that sympathetic toward North Korea. According to a list pulled together by Lawrence Peck, a researcher specializing in the U. S.  pro —  North Korea movement, there could be as many as 70 to 80 such groups, although many are composed of just one person. The major ones include NY —  based Nodutdol and Korean American National Coordinating Committee (KANCC) which organizes “reunion” tourist groups to North Korea and offers   orientations before the groups set off. “We tell them what we expect from them,” said Moon J. Pak, vice president of KANCC, who is in close contact with Roh and has written articles reposted on Minjok Tongshin. “Most Korean Americans think [North Korea] it's a dictator's country, that's not true, [we tell them] ‘you can take pictures with people on the street freely,' to assure them [that] they are not going to a dangerous place. ” The group also has its controversies: Last year, KANCC was forced to deny an accusation of U. S. tax violations published in   South Korean media. Moon denounced the accusation as an attempt to undermine his work, telling BuzzFeed News the office had never been investigated. Peck splits   groups into two categories: “front groups” and “open groups. ” The former appear neutral and address mainstream society  —   he listed Women Cross DMZ, the group of feminist activists who walked across the demilitarized zone intending to demonstrate peace last year, as an example. (The group has denied accusations that they were bolstering the Kim regime, including during a visit to Capitol Hill.) The latter set, like Minjok Tongshin, shows open support for Pyongyang. Peck monitors Roh's website and social media accounts closely. He often emails fellow   Korea activists about Roh's activities, and, “in some rare cases,” goes to monitor Roh's events from a distance to discover hidden members of front groups. Minjok Tongshin's community is well aware of him, he said, pointing to articles that have called him “pathetic. ” (During a   phone call, Roh angrily said he didn't want to talk about Peck and his accusations at all.) Members of these organizations are passionate, but it's unclear how far North Korean influence actually reaches. “I don't even know if there are such groups in our community,” said Chris Lee, the director of the dispute resolution center at Korean American Coalition (KAC) an organization based in L. A. “I know there are a lot of people supporting North Korea in LA, but we don't interact with them they have their own [opinion]. We don't have any relationship, period. ” In truth, the reunified Korea that Roh and his admirers are praying for ultimately is a   regime for Kim. Roh and his ilk's methods are nothing new: When the international community condemns North Korea for its human rights issues, North Korea points back at South Korea and the U. S. for their own human rights abuses. That Roh's video wound up in the Washington Post is a “brilliant North Korea propaganda piece,” said Greg Scarlatoiu, the executive director of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. The video, he said, neglected an important basic fact: The mother of the two sons, reportedly, was an abductee from Romania who eventually “died in North Korea, unable to return to her country. ” (A BBC documentary called Crossing the Line detailed the true story.) “The propaganda news [on Minjok Tongshin] is not 100% true, and those great things that happened did not happen to 99% of the North Korean population. A very big amount [of the population] is suffering,” said Grace Jo, a North Korean defector turned activist who goes to school in Maryland. Jo lost four of her family members to starvation and prison torture during the 1990s famine that killed as many as 3 million people by some estimates, before she escaped and spent her teenage years in China with her mother and her elder sister. “If a naïve student gets exposed to these articles [posted on Roh's website] they will consider North Korea to be good and praise the system,” said Jo. Roh has denied all accusations of propaganda and maintained that he only wrote about “truth” when confronted with his critics' views. While young people in South Korea worry about a chaotic future brought on by the potential reunification, for some   Koreans in the U. S. Roh's work on North Korea provides a happy illusion of an alternate life that they've never lived: simple, pure, with   access to housing, education, and medical treatment. Two new faces inside that L. A. ballroom were Deb Kim and Michael Kim, friends and business partners in their   who are not related. (Both asked that their photos not be used for fear of judgment from L. A.'s   community.) Over cheese rice cake and Korean rice wine at a restaurant called Saek Dong Juh Gori, one of many that serves that largest   population in the country, they spoke of their sympathy for North Korea. “I would definitely prefer to live in North Korea,” Michael said. “People are purer in North Korea, although they are poorer. But there's nothing bad about it. ” Michael was born and raised by Korean parents in the U. S. while Deb moved here with her family from the city of Gwangju when she was 7. Deb didn't know a lot about Roh or Minjok Tongshin before the meeting, but Michael has known Roh since last December. It's been a short time, but to Michael, who has spent many nights defending North Korea on Facebook and around the internet, Roh has already been a role model  —   Michael dreams of establishing an   website to bring North Korea news to mainstream society. Going public with his love for North Korea didn't come without a cost for Michael: his ties with his family. His mother thought he was being insane, said Michael, and he hasn't found much to talk about with most members of his extended family since. At home, Roh, aware of his advanced years, is also having a hard time finding someone to carry his torch. “Hey Daddy, your work is enough, one is enough for our family,” Roh recounts one of his two adult daughters saying. “My kids also have their own values  —   they are almost the American way of thinking,” Roh said with frustration, knowing that he wouldn't be able to convince even his family of the wonder of North Korea. They still respect the work he does since it's what he loves, and they comfort him when he gets depressed by the kinds of North Korea news he deems distorted, just like they did when they were little: “Daddy, one Korea yes, two Korea no!” He says they make him laugh.  ",False," LOS ANGELES     The heart of Koreatown was still hot as night fell in early June. Inside a ballroom on the second floor of a   hotel, a white banner with Korean words revealed the night's theme: Discussion between fellow countrymen in the U. S. on peace and unification.  Ken Roh, 72, was wearing an old,   suit and a bright   tie, and stood greeting the three dozen people who drove from all over the city to see him, a veteran reporter who built his career defending one of the most secretive countries in the world: North Korea. The audience sat straight up, focused, eager to hear about what Roh had seen and heard during a recent    trip to the country and its neighboring areas in China     his 69th visit to the country officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It's become a tradition over the past decade     two to three times each year, the same group of   fans gather, eat Korean food, chat, and wait for the good news brought back firsthand from what they believe is the ideal society. On that June night, Roh started off by triumphantly displaying on a TV screen a Washington Post article that told the story of the two   sons of a former American GI who defected to North Korea in 1962. The article, which detailed their continued loyalty to North Korea, relied on a video of an interview that Roh had done with the two men while in North Korea and had uploaded to the YouTube channel of the news site he founded over a decade ago, Minjok Tongshin. Roh appeared in the video himself, and it has since garnered around 20, 000 views, making it his most watched video ever. He shared his pride with the crowd twice, once in Korean, and another in his    English, telling them he regarded the interview and its subsequent appearance in a huge national newspaper as his number one good job during the visit. The audience applauded. It was a moving interview, Roh said, as someone stood on a chair and took a photo of the room. While everyone else in the world sees North Korea as the home of gulags, starvation, and aggressive missile tests, the South Korean migrs gathered in the ballroom see the country as a     motherland, even if, technically, it's still at war with South Korea despite an armistice signed in 1953. This is the pro   North Korea community in the U. S. whose interests are at odds with the country they've made their home     on Wednesday, July 6, for the first time, the U. S. sanctioned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for human rights abuses. From the outside, everything about the community, from how it emerged, to how far it is willing to carry its commitment to North Korea, is puzzling. Roh and his followers, listening intently to the gospel delivered straight from Pyongyang, offer a window into how North Korea's ideology spreads under the radar on U. S. soil, and, ultimately, just how people decide what to believe in. Roh's house sits along a main road in Glendale, surrounded by vibrant flowers like daylilies and blue jacarandas with an open view of the   Verdugo Mountains. It's nearly 6, 000 miles away from Gangneung, the northeastern coastal city in South Korea where Roh was born in 1944, when the Korean Peninsula was in its last years of Japanese colonial rule. The split that divided the two into a   north and U. S.  south was never meant to be permanent both countries on the Korean Peninsula want to see an end to the status quo, and talks about reunification has been on top of the agenda for decades. The horror of the Korean War     and the inability of North and South to decide what a rejoined government would look like     set the divide firmly into place. These days, the biggest obstacle the tens of thousands of divided families face, according to the Brookings Institute, is North Korea itself.  When Roh was young, though, the Cold War was still in full swing and neither side was particularly admirable. As soon as I graduated [from South Korea's elite Yonsei University] I was trying to find a way to run away from the South Korean territory to pursue the freedom of expression, Roh said, describing how publicly criticizing the government could lead to jailing under   Park Chung Hee. When Roh was still at school, however, he couldn't stay away from politics     as the    of the campus   newspaper, he once surveyed his classmates on how they felt about the government. (  percent responded negatively he said the school cut his scholarship afterward.) He became a student activist against the Park dictatorship, but saw no hope for democratization in South Korea and, after a few years saving up money, decided to come to the USA. It was 1973. At that time I thought that USA was number one democratic country, number one social justice   oriented country, Roh said. But during his years at the University of Texas as an urban sociology student, he changed his mind. I started to know what is jingoism, what is the civil rights movement in the U. S. A. , he said in his somewhat stilted English, pointing to the struggle of black Americans and racist laws targeting Chinese immigrants in the 18th century. I didn't know before I came here. I started to open my consciousness [and] become critical, he said. Even with the constant threat of renewed conflict, for a long time, Roh gave North Korea no thought, maintaining his focus on democratization in South Korea, where oppressive governments remained in power until the late 1980s through U. S. support as a counter to Pyongyang and communist China. Just once in awhile [I thought to myself] Why divided? he recalled. Upon completing his degree, he moved to L. A. and worked for a few local Korean community newspapers. After seeing his articles being thrown out, he says, he quit. North Korea caught Roh's attention for the first time in 1989, when he heard news that several   South Korean dissidents had taken unauthorized trips to Pyongyang as an unofficial way to promote reunification. The trips sparked a new wave of national turmoil in South Korea     the country was dealing with the aftermath of its drastic social transition from an authoritarian state to a democracy. For Roh, the idea of entering North Korea at all seemed like a revelation. The next year, he traveled to North Korea for the first time as an organizing member of a   rally for reunification, the first free border crossing agreed to by the two governments since their division in 1945. Until then, Roh said, he was under the influence of a Western way of thinking and thought Kim Il Sung, North Korea's first leader, was a dictator. But the visit, he said, changed everything. After the rally in Panmunjom, a village north of the 2.   demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates the two countries and where the armistice that paused the Korean War was signed, 15 participants, including Roh and three other Korean migrs, were unexpectedly whisked away and driven to a beautiful villa. Kim Il Sung walked out and greeted them personally they had been chosen to share a meal with the Great Leader. Roh remembered Kim's secretary saying, This is the first time he came out in front of the house. Usually [he's] inside     this is unusual.  I was scared, Roh said, but he made us very comfortable.  Roh recalled the moment when he began to sympathize with Kim, as the North Korean leader described how hard it was to establish the country, counting only seven to eight intellectuals among his leadership's ranks. By the end of the banquet, when a symbolic course of black, rotten potatoes like those that were the only thing available during World War II and the Korean War were served, Kim had won Roh over. My feeling is [that] he's like a grandfather, Roh said. My grandfather.  Roh's interest in North Korea continued once he got back to the U. S. Over the years, he collected the eight volumes of the elder Kim's memoir, With the Century, and memorized them by heart. He's a big believer in North Korea's official ideology, juche, Korean for  also known as Kimilsungism. And he took a more active role promoting reunification the way he knew best, by writing. But this time he wanted his own publication. He couldn't afford to print a newspaper, but the younger brother of a friend, who was working as an internet developer at the time, offered him something he'd never thought of: a website. Mr. Roh, why don't you operate internet news? Roh said the young man asked him one day in 1998, when the internet wasn't yet a popular primary news source (the websites of the Los Angeles Times and the NY Times had launched just three years earlier). Minjok Tongshin, Korean for National Communication, debuted on Nov. 11, 1999. Today, Roh updates the site daily and manages nine other members of the editorial staff, all of whom are volunteers who get only symbolic salaries     no more than $100 a month each, former editorial staff member Rev. Joseph Paik confirmed in a phone interview. Roh says that the operating funds for the website all come from small offline donations from   throughout the country: Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Baltimore, D. C. and NY. People in South Korea sometimes send him money too, he said. Of course many times [we have had a] shortage, Roh said, but money, he says, has never been his top concern. Roh has maintained a series of side jobs, including selling encyclopedias, in which he brought his substantial persuasive abilities to bear, earning enough to buy property in Koreatown. The website's angle hits you right in the face     the U. S. is referred to as imperialist America, and calls South Korean President Park Geun Hye's government oppressive.  (Her father is Park Chung Hee, the former military dictator whose policies Roh spent the early part of his life protesting.) Meanwhile, it dwells on the good deeds of the Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un and cites articles from the Korean Central News Agency and other North Korean   media. South Korea blocked Minjok Tongshin in 2004. Roh considers it a success, claiming a monthly readership of 2 to 3 million, though a typical article gets only a few hundred views. (A review of traffic analytics websites shows that, in reality, Minjok Tongshin gets an average of about 20, 000 visits per month, whereas   community newspaper Korea Times gets about 1, 600, 000. After confronting Roh with the number, he insisted a conservative number of 1 million was accurate, if including social media and email subscribers     but the site has only about 1, 000 Twitter followers and 600 YouTube subscribers.) After that first visit, Roh continued to travel to Pyongyang every year, soon becoming a trustworthy comrade of the North Korean regime, gaining rare access to the country. He once shook hands with the country's current president Kim Jong Un, offering condolences for the death of Kim Jong Il, Kim's father and predecessor. He also claims that the Foreign Ministry is at his disposal to set up interviews upon request, as long as he submits a list of questions they deem appropriate. That's how he was able to reach the sons of the American who defected to North Korea, for the interview that landed him in the Post. He met their father, James Joseph Dresnok, years ago through an exchange of cigarettes, when the two English speakers were both hospitalized in Pyongyang Friendship Hospital. Roh wanted to meet with him during his latest visit, but officials told him Dresnok was too sick. Undeterred, he suggested to officials that he could at least catch up with his friend's sons. The government granted his request after reviewing the required list of questions. Roh's work on Minjok has won the heart of the North Korean government: In 2008, he got a Ph. D. in political science from Kim Il Sung University. In 2014, the government awarded him the Kim Il Sung Prize, which is a very significant award to get from the DPRK, Michael Madden, a visiting scholar at the U. S.  Institute, told BuzzFeed News. Obviously something has been done to the attention to the supreme leadership of North Korea who usually signs off on the document authorizing the prize.  The government treated Roh with a reception for the prize, which comes with a certificate and a   medallion. In the official certificate, he was addressed somewhat awkwardly as the Representative of Korean American Internet Newspaper.  Roh, who was in North Korea for one of his reporting trips, claimed he had no idea the award was coming: They didn't tell me in advance and I only knew as a surprise.  Roh's deep involvement and access has obviously raised some eyebrows. I think he's funded and supported by North Korean government, said Seoungmin Lee, a defector who is currently enrolled at Columbia University. Just look at it, he's supporting North Korea and delivering the messages to the outside world     otherwise why would he do that.  Roh admits that Minjok Tongshin is a pro   North Korea organization, but denies that he's controlled by the North Korean government. One hundred percent [of our funds come] from overseas   [including] even a small percent of funds from South Korea, he said. Minjok Tongshin, however, is not the only organization in the USA that sympathetic toward North Korea. According to a list pulled together by Lawrence Peck, a researcher specializing in the U. S.  pro   North Korea movement, there could be as many as 70 to 80 such groups, although many are composed of just one person. The major ones include NY   based Nodutdol and Korean American National Coordinating Committee (KANCC) which organizes reunion tourist groups to North Korea and offers   orientations before the groups set off. We tell them what we expect from them, said Moon J. Pak, vice president of KANCC, who is in close contact with Roh and has written articles reposted on Minjok Tongshin. Most Korean Americans think [North Korea] it's a dictator's country, that's not true, [we tell them] you can take pictures with people on the street freely,' to assure them [that] they are not going to a dangerous place.  The group also has its controversies: Last year, KANCC was forced to deny an accusation of U. S. tax violations published in   South Korean media. Moon denounced the accusation as an attempt to undermine his work, telling BuzzFeed News the office had never been investigated. Peck splits   groups into two categories: front groups and open groups.  The former appear neutral and address mainstream society     he listed Women Cross DMZ, the group of feminist activists who walked across the demilitarized zone intending to demonstrate peace last year, as an example. (The group has denied accusations that they were bolstering the Kim regime, including during a visit to Capitol Hill.) The latter set, like Minjok Tongshin, shows open support for Pyongyang. Peck monitors Roh's website and social media accounts closely. He often emails fellow   Korea activists about Roh's activities, and, in some rare cases, goes to monitor Roh's events from a distance to discover hidden members of front groups. Minjok Tongshin's community is well aware of him, he said, pointing to articles that have called him pathetic.  (During a   phone call, Roh angrily said he didn't want to talk about Peck and his accusations at all.) Members of these organizations are passionate, but it's unclear how far North Korean influence actually reaches. I don't even know if there are such groups in our community, said Chris Lee, the director of the dispute resolution center at Korean American Coalition (KAC) an organization based in L. A. I know there are a lot of people supporting North Korea in LA, but we don't interact with them they have their own [opinion]. We don't have any relationship, period.  In truth, the reunified Korea that Roh and his admirers are praying for ultimately is a   regime for Kim. Roh and his ilk's methods are nothing new: When the international community condemns North Korea for its human rights issues, North Korea points back at South Korea and the U. S. for their own human rights abuses. That Roh's video wound up in the Washington Post is a brilliant North Korea propaganda piece, said Greg Scarlatoiu, the executive director of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. The video, he said, neglected an important basic fact: The mother of the two sons, reportedly, was an abductee from Romania who eventually died in North Korea, unable to return to her country.  (A BBC documentary called Crossing the Line detailed the true story.) The propaganda news [on Minjok Tongshin] is not 100% true, and those great things that happened did not happen to 99% of the North Korean population. A very big amount [of the population] is suffering, said Grace Jo, a North Korean defector turned activist who goes to school in Maryland. Jo lost four of her family members to starvation and prison torture during the 1990s famine that killed as many as 3 million people by some estimates, before she escaped and spent her teenage years in China with her mother and her elder sister. If a nave student gets exposed to these articles [posted on Roh's website] they will consider North Korea to be good and praise the system, said Jo. Roh has denied all accusations of propaganda and maintained that he only wrote about truth when confronted with his critics' views. While young people in South Korea worry about a chaotic future brought on by the potential reunification, for some   Koreans in the U. S. Roh's work on North Korea provides a happy illusion of an alternate life that they've never lived: simple, pure, with   access to housing, education, and medical treatment. Two new faces inside that L. A. ballroom were Deb Kim and Michael Kim, friends and business partners in their   who are not related. (Both asked that their photos not be used for fear of judgment from L. A.'s   community.) Over cheese rice cake and Korean rice wine at a restaurant called Saek Dong Juh Gori, one of many that serves that largest   population in the country, they spoke of their sympathy for North Korea. I would definitely prefer to live in North Korea, Michael said. People are purer in North Korea, although they are poorer. But there's nothing bad about it.  Michael was born and raised by Korean parents in the U. S. while Deb moved here with her family from the city of Gwangju when she was 7. Deb didn't know a lot about Roh or Minjok Tongshin before the meeting, but Michael has known Roh since last December.

","'Read the full text of the complaint:'] The family of a slain American journalist is suing Syria for her death, in the first war crimes case to be brought against top Syrian officials since the civil war began five years ago. Marie Colvin, 56, died in a rocket attack in the Syrian city of Homs in February 2012. Colvin was deliberately targeted and assassinated by Syrian President Bashar  's government, as part of a strategic campaign against local and foreign journalists, the lawsuit alleges. “Not only do we have a blow by blow account of how she was deliberately murdered  —   assassinated  —   but we can trace it out to an entire pattern of targeting journalists throughout 2011 and into 2012,” said Scott Gilmore, an attorney with the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA) who investigated the case. The night before she was killed, Colvin broadcast reports to CNN and BBC, among others, from the Baba Amr Media Center, a secret makeshift studio in an opposition neighborhood that had come under daily shelling since early February. Colvin's broadcast signal was intercepted by military officials, and her physical location was revealed to intelligence officials by a local informant. Military officials asked the informant to pinpoint the location of the secret studio on a map and then planned an artillery attack against Colvin and other foreign journalists staying at the Media Center, according to the complaint. A French photographer was also killed in the attack, and two others were severely injured. A Syrian official refuted the allegations on Saturday. “I can assure you that this is false by all standards and is certainly not true,” Mohammed Ramez Turgeman, the Syrian minister of information, told the Washington Post. The complaint summarizes nearly four years of investigation by CJA, drawing on accounts from eyewitnesses  survivors, and regime defectors and on some of the 600, 000 documents smuggled out of Syria by the Commission for International Justice and Accountability. The complaint names nine officials, including Assad's brother and a leader of one Syria's local “paramilitary death squads,” known as shabiha. Cathleen Colvin, plaintiff in the lawsuit and sister of Marie Colvin, says the evidence Gilmore and his colleagues uncovered confirmed her earliest suspicions that her sister had been deliberately targeted. “All along, I thought it was too much of a coincidence. Her story the night before on CNN [said] the Syrian government is lying, it is indiscriminately shelling a city full of starved civilians,” Colvin told BuzzFeed News by telephone. “Her reporting the night before [her death] was so powerful, and to get call the next morning she's killed  —   I thought they were trying to silence her from the beginning. ” Colvin said photographer Paul Conroy, who survived the attack on the Media Center, also suspected the journalists had been targeted. “Paul is   and he could tell by the pattern of fire that they were zeroing in, that it wasn't a random attack,” Colvin said. Colvin said she was moved to file the suit out of a desire to see officials in the Assad regime brought to justice and to renew the focus on ongoing atrocities in Syria. “I wanted to call attention to [the Syrians'] suffering and how many families lost loved ones in Syria, and also to the fact that no one is there to witness it,” she said. “The Assads of the world can operate with impunity. ” Colvin's lawsuit is the first case to be brought against Assad officials for war crimes  —   and is brought under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which allows American citizens to sue countries designated by the U. S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. “Taking Marie away from us was just so painful. I was really lucky to have her in my life  —   she was my biggest supporter, and I was hers  —   and to have someone deliberately take that away is just something I can't live with without doing something about it,” Colvin said. “I would love to be able to bring criminal charges in the Hague but I can't. ” The Hague is home to the International Criminal Court, but it can't try Assad or other Syrian officials without a referral by the United Nations Security Council  —   and that's not likely to happen any time soon. “The prospect of ICC is pretty much dead in the water,” says Toby Cadman, a British lawyer who has worked on war crimes cases in Bosnia, Bangladesh, Syria and elsewhere. “The ICC has no jurisdiction over Syria, and the Security Council will never refer the matter. Russia and China have consistently vetoed any resolution referring the situation to the ICC and will continue to do so. ” As permanent members of the council, Russia and China can halt any referral with a veto. Russia has a particular interest in keeping the issue away from the ICC because its own military is also involved on the ground there, Cadman noted. “There is a distinct lack of accountability on the international level” for the atrocities that have been committed in Syria, Cadman said. The Colvin lawsuit is “hugely significant [as] a first step in ensuring justice and accountability in Syria. ” But it is just a first step. Cadman and other lawyers are working on bringing more cases, both civil and criminal, against Assad and his allies in national courts around the world. France, Spain and England all have universal jurisdiction laws that allow their courts to hear criminal cases against Assad, and Cadman says he and other lawyers intend to use them. “Criminal cases will be opened and defendants, once arrested, will be prosecuted,” he said. “The Marie Colvin case is the first case. I expect the US Court to uphold the complaint and award millions in compensation to the plaintiffs. That is important. But what is equally, if not more important, is that criminal cases will follow. ”   ",False,"'Read the full text of the complaint:'] The family of a slain American journalist is suing Syria for her death, in the first war crimes case to be brought against top Syrian officials since the civil war began five years ago.

168,73605,110152, Trump Campaign CEO Was Accused Of Sexual Harassment In ‘90s Legal Dispute,Buzzfeed News,Andrew Kaczynski,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/trump-campaign-ceo-was-accused-of-sexual-harassment-in-90s-l
"," Trump's campaign CEO Stephen Bannon and an associate were accused of sexual harassment in a 1990s court case. The suit was related to Bannon's time as director of Biosphere 2, a research facility located in Oracle, Arizona, that aimed to simulate the surface of Mars. Then a Los Angeles —  based investment banker, Bannon worked as a consultant trying to cut ballooning costs related to the ecological research center at behest of Texas billionaire Edward Bass, the project's financial backer. The suit, filed by Biosphere 2's former director Margret Augustine, named Bass as the primary defendant. Bannon and a fellow banker, Martin Bowen, were also named and accused of having acted as his agents. Augustine accused Bass of having used his agents to dissociate her from the Biosphere project in breach of an earlier agreement. She also accused him of using Bannon and Bowen to slander her by saying she had stolen from the Biosphere gift shop and the project's construction fund. Soon after filing the complaint, she dropped a claim that Bannon and Bowen had invaded her privacy by deleting messages from her answering machine and opening her mail, saying that she would only press charges for incidents that occurred before April 1, 1994. The claims provoked a   from Space Biosphere Ventures, the company that controlled the project, accusing Augustine of having engaged in   and stealing from the company. But the most explosive allegations were that Bannon and Bowen, had made sexually suggestive remarks and lewd remarks toward her, and had disparaged female employees of the research facility. Both Bannon and Bowen denied the sexual harassment at the time. An affidavit from Bannon said he “did not undertake any sexual harassment towards Margaret Augustine. ” On Monday, a spokeswoman for Bannon told BuzzFeed News, “The Bass Organization sued Ms. Augustine for fraud for embezzling $800, 000. She then sued two representatives of the Bass Organization having never complained about any behavior. Subsequently, she dropped her legal action. Ms Augustine was removed as CEO in a corporate restructuring in 1993. ” In her complaint, Augustine said, “Both Bowen and Bannon were insulting to the plaintiff and other females employees of Biosphere 2, and in their presence, and against their will, made lewd remarks, told offensive   stories, made disparaging remarks about females, made sexually suggestive remarks, discussed females they had known in a lewd and derogatory fashion and in general acted with total indifference to the feelings of the plaintiff and other female employees of Biosphere 2. ” Augustine claimed specifically that Bannon once commented the problem with an employee she “was a woman in a man's job. ” She claimed that during a trip, “Steve Bannon and Martin Bowen made comments as women walked by about the size of women's breasts and body parts in lewd tones and language. Martin spoke about a centerfold in Playboy magazine who was born in a town he went to school in or grew up in, in Texas on 5 separate occasions, discussing the size of her ‘boobs,' ‘titties,' etc. ” She said at company party she danced with Bannon and he “held my wrist tightly and told me that once I'd done it with him I'd never want to do it with anyone else. ” On another occasion, she said Bannon yelled at her, citing another employee's performance. “Steve Bannon started shouting at me that the whole ‘Goddam problem was that I let Larry Pomatte get his swinging dick in here.' I stood up and said I would not continue a meeting being spoken to in that manner. Steve said, ‘You will Goddam well will sit the fuck down and  …    '” She said she was shaken and ended the meeting. Augustine added in the complaint she contacted Bass about the behavior to advise him about the conduct but not action was taken. As a result, she alleged, Bannon “continued to make the same sort of lewd, suggestive, rude, and insulting comments to the plaintiff and other female employees of Biosphere 2. ” She said as a result she “suffered severe mental distress and anxiety” that required “the help of medical care practitioners and the incurring of medical and hospital bills as a result thereof. ” Bass had sued Augustine just a day before her case was filed. His suit claimed that Augustine “allegedly paid a company she owned nearly $800, 000 in   Biosphere funds,” according to a report in the Tucson Citizen. Bass accused her of “diverting funds for her personal use, including having SBV pay to remodel her house, thefts from the six gift shops, kickbacks, and apparent sweetheart deals with subcontractor,” according to author Jane Poynter in The Human Experiment: Two Years and Twenty Minutes Inside Biosphere 2. The judge ruled in favor of the defense on Augustine's allegation that Bass had dissociated her from the project and Augustine ultimately dropped her slander claims, in addition to her claims that her privacy was invaded. The sexual harassment count, along with the   against Augustine, was ultimately settled. Augustine's lawyer was not immediately available to discuss the case. Augustine did not return a request for comment on the matter. Bowen did not return a request for comment. Neither Bass, nor his publicist, immediately returned a request for comment. According two books on Biosphere 2 and newspaper accounts, Bannon had originally been brought into bring costs under but was not allowed by the current management, including Augustine, to audit the project's records with accounts conflicting as to why. Bass got a court order take control of the project and an order to bar the current management employees from the premise, and that's when Bannon was given control. On Friday, Mother Jones reported on a separate trial related to Biosphere where Bannon said in testimony that he had called one of the plaintiffs a “  deluded young woman” and a “bimbo. ” The “bimbo” comment came after the plaintiff had compared a atmospheric breach into the closed research center to the space shuttle Challenger explosion, according to a report in the Arizona Daily Star. Bannon would eventually leave the project and Columbia University would take over Biosphere 2.

172,73609,110157," Something's Gone Wrong At Starbucks, According To Baristas",Buzzfeed News,Venessa Wong,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/venessawong/heres-why-lines-have-grown-so-long-at-starbucks
"," Have you experienced   lines at Starbucks lately? If so, some of the company's staff say there's a reason for the longer waits: the coffee chain has been cutting back on worker hours, leading to declining service in stores. As a   business, Starbucks has been on a roll lately  —   the coffee chain reported another quarter of record sales and profit last week. So it baffled many of the company's hourly employees in the U. S. when, as business boomed this spring, they noticed a dramatic change: they weren't getting enough hours of work. Eight Starbucks employees from several cities around the country told BuzzFeed News that since May, the number of work hours assigned to stores by the chain's Global Labor Scheduling (GLS) system has fallen far below both what they need and what they normally receive. The change came with no warning or explanation from executives some staff say their schedules were cut in advance, while others have been sent home during their shifts. Many have taken to social media to complain, with some threatening to quit. It's an unexpected turn for the Seattle coffee chain, which has long considered itself an employer of choice in a fast food industry infamous for   pay and benefits, and demoralized workers. An internal communication portal used by the company has received numerous complaints from staff  —   “partners,” in Starbucks lingo  —   about reduced hours and declining morale, according to screenshots provided to BuzzFeed News. Starbucks told BuzzFeed News there has been no change in labor strategy and managers are being asked to handle staffing as needed on a    basis. “We are not trying to reduce labor. We want our stores staffed in accordance with what they each need,” said spokesperson Jaime Riley. Yet an internal company email reviewed by BuzzFeed News, which was sent to field leaders in May, suggests the company is closely watching labor expenses across the chain as growth slows. It said the weeks in May and June following Starbucks' Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion are “historically challenging weeks to forecast and schedule as the business experiences a significant decrease in transactions, resulting in an overspend in labor. ” The email asks field leaders to help control this overspending using a new “forecasting tool” that would “adjust forecasts and compensate for downward trend in business. ” “‘Reducing overspending' seems like good business sense,” Riley, the Starbucks spokesperson, said in response to the email. Starbucks staff told BuzzFeed News that store managers use the company's GLS software to determine how many worker hours they can allocate. The managers input how many transactions they think their location will ring up for a given week, and the system generates an allocation of total labor hours, using an algorithm that also takes into account historical sales. The store manager then assigns those hours to individual workers. But in recent months, staff say that managers noticed their estimates were returning fewer hours. Just by way of illustration, if an estimated 800 transactions usually earned a store 70 hours of labor, the store might now receive only 65 hours for the same estimate. “Someone seemingly flipped a switch on the labor model,” one manager who has worked for Starbucks for nearly a decade told BuzzFeed News. “The whole month of July has been the tightest in scheduling I've ever experienced,” said another longtime manager. Starbucks sales, despite reaching new highs, have fallen short of expectations for the last nine months. The chain experienced a slowdown in U. S. sales growth from April to June  —   sales at cafes open at least 13 months increased by 4% compared to 8% during the same period last year. The company has called its recent performance an anomaly and expects its domestic business to pick up again. “With costs of raw coffee going up and minimum wage rising, they will be looking for cost efficiencies anyplace they can find them,” said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones. I noticed a change in service myself back in June, as did other Starbucks customers. @Starbucks the customer service at my local shop is getting pretty disappointing. What's going on? :( 25min to get a latte at @Starbucks today was a new low in customer service. Time for a change? Starbucks' recent labor situation was the subject of an online worker petition started in June. Cutting back on hours “creates an atmosphere where baristas are worn to the bone without being able to take a breath. Cleanliness suffers, speed of service suffers, partners suffer  …    . .the labor climate keeps most baristas regularly underemployed, enough to qualify for benefits, but not enough to afford to pay for them,” it read. The petition has attracted 13, 500 signatures so far. Despite the attention garnered by the petition, Starbucks says it has been tracking complaints from its employees and only 3% have been related to staffing and scheduling in recent weeks. Riley, the company spokesperson, said the chain has received “overwhelmingly positive” feedback about a U. S. pay raise announced this month, which moves a scheduled pay bump forward from next January to this October. On Monday, Starbucks confirmed to BuzzFeed News that it will also pay a $500 bonus to employees who have been with the company for at least two years. When it comes to the perceived cutback in hours, “we encourage partners to work with managers on staffing scheduling needs,” Riley said. A number of Starbucks workers  —   many who said they used to love their jobs  —   have shared their stories online about the effect of reductions in hours. Here are some condensed excerpts. “Because our store manager is contacted constantly about hours, we are asked to send labor updates at 12p, 4p, and 8p every day. But even if we end up 100+ transactions over forecast and have already cut hours, we're told we should have cut more. My store continually meets and exceeds the confusing, sometimes nearly impossible goals set forth by a computer system and people who are 1, 000 miles away. ”   Leslie, “Although my schedules say 20 hours, since labor is being cut I can never hit the 20 hour mark. That means I don't qualify for benefits. My husband's 40 hours a week [at Starbucks] have turned into 29 hours a week. It's hard. It's hard to think about the next schedules being put up, and dreading looking at he number of hours we are getting. Trying to calculate how much money we need to make just to get the kids fed, keep the lights on, and gas in the car. No one wants to give up hours, which means picking up shifts is getting harder and harder because everyone is scrounging for hours. .I've never seen such an aggression about labor before. Over five years, and I've never had to truly worry about my hours, they stayed consistent. .with the occasional ‘You wanna go home early today?' But now it's ‘You have to go home, we are way over on labor.'   …     In the past six months, I have heard more about numbers and labor than I have in the five years I've been with Starbucks. ”   Caylee, “I noticed we seemed to be short staffed more often and it always felt like we were all flustered or moving at a dizzying pace. I also became a shift supervisor about a month ago. Advancing in my position is a huge change as it is. Add in even less people to work with but having the same volume of customers, and I am so physically and emotionally exhausted that my job is not even fun for me anymore. Want to know the last time I had a lunch break during one of my eight hour shifts? I couldn't even tell you since it has been so long ago. In fact, today I worked a nine hour shift on the floor with just one   break, long enough to take a few sips of my iced vanilla chai and eat a doughnut. ”   Stephannie, “With only two people on the floor at a cafe, we can barely keep up, as the lobby is neglected and bathrooms and customers are complaining. I plan to hang in there but a lot of partners have no choice but look for other employment. ”   Vickie, “Short night shifts, cut down to two hours because of being sent home early, were too much. We were closing the highest volume store in the city with only three employees in the tourist area of town. It was a constant battle of being sent home early, or scrambling all night, unable to get everything done. Driving 30 minutes to work wasn't worth it, especially for the poor pay as a barista with a newborn at home. ”   Bailey, “However, the reality is that if I spend my morning on the floor with six or seven people who are killing themselves to fill customer orders that really call for eight or nine baristas (mostly because [Global Labor Scheduling] doesn't adequately account for things like   orders or food [orders]) I'm exhausted by the time I get home. Beyond that, being overworked and understaffed hurts partner morale. It makes it so that stores not as clean and pleasant as they should be, and customers are not taken care of in the way that they deserve to be. ”   Noel, “Orders are put on the bar where our solo barista makes every single beverage as fast as possible while trying to focus on what they are doing whilst grabbing all those stickers from cafe,   and [mobile order and pay]. The drive thru times are suffering horribly our average ticket is six to eight drinks each car! It looks bad on the company from a guests perspective to have three or four partners on the floor when the place is absolute chaos. ”   Samantha, “But you can see it in our faces and demeanors how much it's taking its toll. And now I received a paycheck for not even $200 that is nowhere near enough to pay my rent and bills. This so for two weeks work! !! Our store has failed two [Quality Assurance Standards Assessment] audits in the month because it never stays clean enough because we never have enough people to maintain the store. We never have schedules ready until a few days before the next week starts. Deliveries are made and stay there for days because on two man sets who's going to put it away. We're just exhausted, disappointed and now angry that all of our hard work is being taken for granted. I can't survive on this dismal pay and only 15 to 20 weekly tips. I'm going to have to cut off my medical insurance and stop 401k just so I can make ends meet! I love my job but I can't survive in this atmosphere!”   Andre,   ",False," Have you experienced   lines at Starbucks lately? If so, some of the company's staff say there's a reason for the longer waits: the coffee chain has been cutting back on worker hours, leading to declining service in stores. As a   business, Starbucks has been on a roll lately     the coffee chain reported another quarter of record sales and profit last week. So it baffled many of the company's hourly employees in the U. S. when, as business boomed this spring, they noticed a dramatic change: they weren't getting enough hours of work. Eight Starbucks employees from several cities around the country told BuzzFeed News that since May, the number of work hours assigned to stores by the chain's Global Labor Scheduling (GLS) system has fallen far below both what they need and what they normally receive. The change came with no warning or explanation from executives some staff say their schedules were cut in advance, while others have been sent home during their shifts. Many have taken to social media to complain, with some threatening to quit. It's an unexpected turn for the Seattle coffee chain, which has long considered itself an employer of choice in a fast food industry infamous for   pay and benefits, and demoralized workers. An internal communication portal used by the company has received numerous complaints from staff     partners, in Starbucks lingo     about reduced hours and declining morale, according to screenshots provided to BuzzFeed News. Starbucks told BuzzFeed News there has been no change in labor strategy and managers are being asked to handle staffing as needed on a    basis. We are not trying to reduce labor. We want our stores staffed in accordance with what they each need, said spokesperson Jaime Riley. Yet an internal company email reviewed by BuzzFeed News, which was sent to field leaders in May, suggests the company is closely watching labor expenses across the chain as growth slows. It said the weeks in May and June following Starbucks' Frappuccino Happy Hour promotion are historically challenging weeks to forecast and schedule as the business experiences a significant decrease in transactions, resulting in an overspend in labor.  The email asks field leaders to help control this overspending using a new forecasting tool that would adjust forecasts and compensate for downward trend in business.  Reducing overspending' seems like good business sense, Riley, the Starbucks spokesperson, said in response to the email. Starbucks staff told BuzzFeed News that store managers use the company's GLS software to determine how many worker hours they can allocate. The managers input how many transactions they think their location will ring up for a given week, and the system generates an allocation of total labor hours, using an algorithm that also takes into account historical sales. The store manager then assigns those hours to individual workers. But in recent months, staff say that managers noticed their estimates were returning fewer hours. Just by way of illustration, if an estimated 800 transactions usually earned a store 70 hours of labor, the store might now receive only 65 hours for the same estimate. Someone seemingly flipped a switch on the labor model, one manager who has worked for Starbucks for nearly a decade told BuzzFeed News. The whole month of July has been the tightest in scheduling I've ever experienced, said another longtime manager. Starbucks sales, despite reaching new highs, have fallen short of expectations for the last nine months. The chain experienced a slowdown in U. S. sales growth from April to June     sales at cafes open at least 13 months increased by 4% compared to 8% during the same period last year. The company has called its recent performance an anomaly and expects its domestic business to pick up again. With costs of raw coffee going up and minimum wage rising, they will be looking for cost efficiencies anyplace they can find them, said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones. I noticed a change in service myself back in June, as did other Starbucks customers. @Starbucks the customer service at my local shop is getting pretty disappointing. What's going on? :( 25min to get a latte at @Starbucks today was a new low in customer service. Time for a change? Starbucks' recent labor situation was the subject of an online worker petition started in June. Cutting back on hours creates an atmosphere where baristas are worn to the bone without being able to take a breath. Cleanliness suffers, speed of service suffers, partners suffer      . .the labor climate keeps most baristas regularly underemployed, enough to qualify for benefits, but not enough to afford to pay for them, it read. The petition has attracted 13, 500 signatures so far. Despite the attention garnered by the petition, Starbucks says it has been tracking complaints from its employees and only 3% have been related to staffing and scheduling in recent weeks. Riley, the company spokesperson, said the chain has received overwhelmingly positive feedback about a U. S. pay raise announced this month, which moves a scheduled pay bump forward from next January to this October. On Monday, Starbucks confirmed to BuzzFeed News that it will also pay a $500 bonus to employees who have been with the company for at least two years. When it comes to the perceived cutback in hours, we encourage partners to work with managers on staffing scheduling needs, Riley said.

173,73610,110159, Confidential Document Shows How Peter Thiel Really Feels About Palantir,Buzzfeed News,William Alden,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/leak-shows-how-peter-thiel-really-feels-about-palantir
"," A confidential document from tech billionaire Peter Thiel's venture capital firm raises doubts about the valuation of Palantir Technologies, the highly touted Silicon Valley data analysis company of which Thiel is   and chairman. The document also reveals that Thiel's firm's own investment results are among the strongest in the industry, at least on paper. Palantir, a    startup that crunches data for   agencies and corporate giants, sold shares to investors last year at a valuation of roughly $20 billion, making it the    American tech startup, behind only Uber and Airbnb. But at the same time, Thiel's firm, Founders Fund  —   an early and repeat backer of Palantir  —   privately pegged Palantir's valuation at nearly 40% less than that, according to the document, a slide deck for investors that was reviewed by BuzzFeed News. Founders Fund assessed Palantir's value at $12. 7 billion as of Sept. 30, 2015, according to a footnote in the document. This   carrying value is 38% lower than the valuation of $20. 6 billion that Palantir received from investors in the latest financing round, the document shows. (The $20. 6 billion figure differs from the $20 billion figure because it includes the cash raised in the round, as of Sept. 30.) Other major investors have also taken a conservative stance on Palantir's worth. As of March 31, several big mutual funds, including two managed by Morgan Stanley, valued their Palantir shares at 48% below the price in last year's investment round, according to data collected by research firm Morningstar. But the opinion of Thiel  —   a celebrity in Silicon Valley and a demigod inside Palantir  —   will likely turn heads among some Palantir shareholders and employees, who have already voiced concerns about their ability to sell their shares. Thiel, who started Founders Fund with two partners in 2005, knows as much about Palantir as virtually anyone, leading the company's   board. While Palantir has grown in both revenue and employees, its $420 million in cash collections for 2015 amounted to less than a quarter of its customer bookings, raising questions about Palantir's ability to convert those deals into revenue, BuzzFeed News reported in May. A founder of PayPal and board member of Facebook, Thiel will take prime position on the national stage tonight, delivering a speech in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention. Earlier this year, the famously libertarian Thiel generated national headlines when it was revealed that he secretly financed the wrestler Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media, as part of a   campaign to punish the company. At Palantir, insiders often describe projects in terms of “zero to one,” Thiel's favored catchphrase for creating something new. The valuation disparity revealed in the Founders Fund document could highlight little more than a quirk in how startups are valued by their various investors. It's not unusual for top venture firms to privately value their portfolio companies at levels below what was reached in a recent financing round, three venture capitalists told BuzzFeed News, though it is hard to say whether a discount as big as 40% is common. Venture firms reason that it's safer to be conservative when reporting valuations of companies that aren't yet publicly traded, since “it's better to write up an investment when it exits than to write it down because it's imperiled,” said David Pakman, a partner at Venrock in NY. But another venture capitalist, Roger Ehrenberg, managing partner of IA Ventures, said a lower carrying value could be the result of a number of factors, including a financial stumble by the company or simply a different method for determining what a company is worth. “Where carrying value is lower, you need to ask yourself why,” he said in an email. The methodology Founders Fund used to value Palantir isn't known. For another one of its investments, the rocket company SpaceX, Founders Fund did not report a carrying value, instead using the valuation from a recent investment round, according to a person who has seen that page of the confidential document. Spokespeople for Founders Fund and Palantir both declined to comment. As for Founders Fund itself, it appears to be living up to its reputation as one of the top venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. Its first four investment funds have reported returns that exceeded the best funds of their class, the confidential document shows. (Several of the funds are actually fund groups, with a main fund accompanied by smaller funds.) The firm's first fund, which dates to 2005, reported a 37% net internal rate of return, or IRR, through the end of September, far surpassing an 11% benchmark of   funds compiled by the research and advisory firm Cambridge Associates. The second (dating to 2007) third (2010) and fourth (2011) funds reported net IRRs of 33% 36% and 58% respectively, each surpassing the benchmark of   funds for those years. The fifth fund, totaling $1. 1 billion, dates to 2014 and reported a 79% net IRR, but the IRR metric, by its nature, tends to be significantly higher for younger funds. A number of the firm's   investments showed strong gains on paper as of the end of September. Its investment in the home rental site Airbnb was up 8. 1 times, its investment in SpaceX was up 8. 7 times, its investment in music streaming service Spotify was up 9. 3 times, and its investment in Palantir was up 6. 2 times, the document shows. Its stake in the health insurance startup Oscar was up 2. 6 times, according to the document, and its stake in the payments processor Stripe was up 2. 7 times. At the same time, the confidential performance results showed how long it can take a venture capital firm like Founders Fund to return cash to its investors. As many startups, including Palantir, avoid the public markets, venture capitalists have had a harder time doing the   work of selling their investment stakes and realizing profits. Venture capital funds typically are supposed to produce cash returns after 10 years or a little longer, but according to a recent analysis by the National Venture Capital Association, only 27% of funds had been dissolved after 12 years or less. For example, Founders Fund's second main fund, worth $211 million and dating to 2007, had liquidated only $108 million of securities as of Sept. 30, or about 51% of the fund's initial assets, according to the document. It had distributed just 21% of the fund to investors  —   meaning investors hadn't even come close to getting their investment back. While that fund had multiplied its assets by more than eight (including the value of illiquid securities, as well as realized proceeds and distributions to investors) the net realized gains for that fund group amounted to $85. 8 million, according to the document. In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that Founders Fund's second fund was trying to sell Palantir shares, reflecting a broader desire by venture capitalists to cash in on their startup investments. A subsequent Journal article reported that some investors who had given money to Founders Fund said they had “grown impatient that they aren't receiving bigger cash distributions. ” The confidential document does not capture a more recent success for Founders Fund. In April, drug company AbbVie agreed to buy a Founders Fund portfolio company, the cancer drug developer Stemcentrx, for $5. 8 billion, producing the largest “exit” in Founders Fund's history, according to Bloomberg News. Founders Fund used the confidential document to help raise its sixth fund, worth $1. 3 billion, in March. The information about Palantir comes from a slide showing Founders Fund's investments in the data company over time. The firm said it had invested a total of $164. 5 million in Palantir through six investment rounds and various small purchases of common stock all but $8 million of Founders Fund's stake is in preferred shares. This stake was worth $1. 07 billion as of the end of September (a tally that includes a $44. 7 million distribution to investors from the first fund) the document shows. Palantir raised a total of $880 million in a financing round last year, from at least July to December, public filings show. The round began with the company aiming to raise $500 million. The information in the confidential document, dating to Sept. 30, falls in the middle of the investment period. Separately, Palantir recently said it would buy up to $225 million of its own common stock from current and former employees, part of a broader effort to address unease among staff, BuzzFeed News reported. The price offered by Palantir for common shares was higher than where several mutual fund investors were valuing the company's preferred shares.

"," Netflix's growth in the U. S. has slowed to a   and the company is adding new international users slower than expected. Overall, the company added 1. 7 million new subscribers in the last three months  —   less than the 2. 5 million the company predicted  —   and just 160, 000 of them were in the U. S. That's well below the 700, 000 extra U. S. subscribers that analysts were expecting the company to report, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The company now has just over 83 million subscribers, according to its quarterly earnings letter released on Monday.

While the company has said it would “grandfather” the old prices for up to two years, some people seem to be canceling their plans even before the hike takes effect. “We think some members perceived the news as an impending new price increase rather than the completion of two years of grandfathering. Churn of members who were actually un grandfathered is modest and conforms to our expectations,” the company said in its letter. In adding 160, 000 new U.

S. in the second quarter of 2014 and 900, 000 in the second quarter of 2015. It expects that slower growth to continue into the next quarter, with 300, 000 net new users in the U.

Overall, the company added 1. 7 million new subscribers in the last three months     less than the 2. 5 million the company predicted     and just 160, 000 of them were in the U. S. That's well below the 700, 000 extra U. S. subscribers that analysts were expecting the company to report, according to data collected by Bloomberg.

In February, it acquired Gilt Groupe, which runs the discount site Gilt. com, for $250 million. Consumers clearly are looking for deals, even if they're not always shopping in the right places.

So it's an “anomaly” that Saks Fifth Avenue would offer a steeper discount on the exact same product, in a wider range of sizes, Raghubir said.

176,73613,110162, Will Feds Keep Protecting Transgender Workers In Wake Of Court Ruling?,Buzzfeed News,Dominic Holden,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/will-feds-keep-protecting-transgender-workers-in-wake-of-cou
"," On August 21, a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the federal government from enforcing guidance and rules  —   based on Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972  —   that protect transgender students in public schools. That decision did not go as far as Texas and 11 other states behind the lawsuit wanted. They had requested a preliminary injunction that also would suspend policies and guidance under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that protect transgender workers. But the judge's order didn't mention Title VII or workers  —   just Title IX and schools. That might seem to settle the matter: The government cannot enforce its guidance in schools or in litigation resulting from that school guidance, the thinking goes, but it could enforce its rules when a transgender employee alleges discrimination in a workplace. But now, more than a week since US District Court Judge Reed O'Connor issued his order, there is growing uncertainty about how the federal government will proceed. At the heart of the problem, according to Ezra Young, a staff attorney at the Transgender Legal Defense  Education Fund (TLDEF) is that the language in Judge O'Connor's injunction could be read fairly broadly. “It unclear as to which laws and agencies it attempts to enjoin enforcement of,” Young told BuzzFeed News. “We believe clarification is needed. ” For example, O'Connor writes that the injunction “shall be binding on Defendants”  —   and the defendants include agencies that deal with employment, such as the Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In addition, O'Connor's order bans the agencies from asserting the “guidelines” carry weight in court in cases initiated after his order, but Young said it is unclear if those guidelines concern only policies in schools or also in workplaces. Young said early Tuesday that he expected government lawyers to ask the court for “clarification as to which defendants are enjoined and which issues are covered by injunction  —   whether it is just Title IX or whether it goes further than Title IX. ” On Tuesday evening, the Justice Department did file a file a notice asking for clarification, but only insofar as to ask O'Connor “to make it clear beyond any doubt that they are free to proceed” with a list of cases that the department determined are related to, but distinct from, the Texas litigation. Detailing its view of the limits set by O'Connor in the injunction, Justice Department lawyers then state that they “believe that the cases listed   …     fall outside the scope of these prohibitions”  —   meaning that the department believes it should be free to continue litigating those cases. On the larger question of the injunction itself, the Justice Department added in Tuesday night's filing that it “expect[s] to file a motion seeking relief with respect to the Court's preliminary injunction. ” It did not, however, give any timeline as to when it will do so. BuzzFeed News earlier had asked the Department of Justice and EEOC, which oversees enforcement of civil rights law in workplaces, whether they would continue to investigate complaints from transgender workers and enforce their interpretation of Title VII. The Justice Department did not answer the question, and the question of investigating new potential cases was not addressed in Tuesday's filing. A spokesperson for the EEOC, Kimberly   did respond, but only said that the agency “is currently reviewing the [judge's] order and assessing its implications. ” That evasion is at odds from the EEOC's outspoken positions over the past several years. It first found that Title VII's ban on sex discrimination prohibits transgender discrimination in 2012, then later expanded that specifically to include such things as restroom usage. But Paul Castillo, a lawyer for Lambda Legal, which had filed a brief in the case supporting the transgender protections, told BuzzFeed News that his view of O'Connor's order is that the agencies can still enforce rules for transgender workers. “The judge's order doesn't stop them from investigating and and processing complaints under Title VII,” he said, adding that the EEOC “can continue business as usual. ” The Texas Attorney General's Office, asked about the scope of the judge's order, also said it only directly concerns schools, governed by Title IX. “This order does not address Title VII,” said spokesperson Kayleigh Lovvorn. There could, however, be an effect on workplace cases, she said, because courts consider case law interpreting Title IX when evaluating a case concerning Title VII. “Thus, the injunction will impact Title VII adjudications. ” The EEOC has been at the legal vanguard to argue that existing civil rights law protects transgender people. In the past four years, it has accepted complaints and filed litigation against employers that it found discriminated on the basis of gender identity. And in 2014,   General Eric Holder said the Justice Department would maintain the same position in its litigation. If the EEOC is halting that work for now, the impact could affect cases between two private parties  —   not just those cases that rely on government participation. This is why: Before a worker can sue an employer under federal civil rights law, the agency details, he or she must first file a complaint with the EEOC and obtain a “    ” letter. Asked if the EEOC would continue, in the wake of the Texas court ruling, to accept complaints and issue    letters to workers alleging   discrimination so those workers could pursue lawsuits on their own,   did not comment. Young, the TLDEF attorney, said, “Our understanding is that the EEOC, like the other defendants in the litigation, is seeking clarification on what the injunction means. That is very likely why they are declining to answer questions about the    letter. ”  ",False," On August 21, a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the federal government from enforcing guidance and rules     based on Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972     that protect transgender students in public schools.

","'Read the order:'] A federal judge in Texas has blocked the Obama administration's federal policies protecting transgender students and workers, issuing a nationwide injunction against enforcement of the policies regarding restroom use. U. S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth issued the order sought by Texas and 10 other states on Sunday. The states sued the Obama administration in May over its guidelines regarding accommodating transgender students in restrooms and facilities at public schools. The 11 states had asked O'Connor to suspend Obama's policies  —   largely an interpretation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972  —   in a hearing held on Aug. 12. “Defendants have conspired to turn workplaces and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights,” the states' complaint stated. In his   order, O'Connor ruled that the states had standing to bring their lawsuit because the administration's “Guidelines are clearly designed to target [their] conduct. ” The court found that the Obama administration's actions likely violate the Administrative Procedure Act for failing to follow proper notice and comment procedures under the law because, the court found, the policies are “legislative and substantive. ” Additionally, the court found that, under the text of the law, the Obama administration's interpretation is incorrect  —   a ruling that contradicts an earlier decision from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in a related case challenging a Virginia school district's policies. While the administration argued that the guidance is allowed because the use of the word “sex” in regulations implementing Title IX is ambiguous, O'Connor disagreed. “[T]he Court concludes § 106. 33 is not ambiguous,” he wrote. “It cannot be disputed that the plain meaning of the term sex as used in § 106. 33 when it was enacted by DOE following passage of Title IX meant the biological and anatomical differences between male and female students as determined at their birth. ” Of the administration's guidance purporting to change that “plain meaning,” then, he added: “A definition that confuses instead of clarifies is unpersuasive”  —   citing the judge who dissented from the 4th Circuit's decision for support. In granting the states' request, O'Connor issued a nationwide injunction of the guidance, writing that “while this injunction remains in place, [the Obama administration is] enjoined from initiating, continuing, or concluding any investigation based on [its] interpretation that the definition of sex includes gender identity in Title IX's prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex. ” O'Connor also ordered that the administration not use the guidelines or claim that they “carry weight in any litigation initiated following the date of this Order. ” “The department is disappointed in the court's decision, and we are reviewing our options,” Justice Department press secretary Dena Iverson told BuzzFeed News. Although Iverson would not signal either way, the administration is expected to appeal. Paul Castillo, a   lawyer with that LGBT advocacy group Lambda Legal, told BuzzFeed News he believes an appeal is “widely expected. ”In the short term, Castillo thinks the injunction will prevent federal officials from threatening to withhold federal education funds from schools that ban transgender students that match their gender identity. However, he added, “It will not prevent private attorneys, such as Lambda Legal and the ACLU, from representing transgender students by bringing cases against schools that discriminate against them. ” He said other LGBT groups could file lawsuits as well.

"," We all know the Classic Makeover Montage well. A beautiful actress we're supposed to believe is a homely slob because her hair's a little frizzy is bestowed with a flatiron and some makeup  —   after a parade of product placements, she's the belle of the ball. There is perhaps no feminine transformation as famous as the one in John Hughes' The Breakfast Club, that gold standard of high school movies and launcher of a thousand teen cliches. Ally Sheedy's Allison goes from Hollywood's idea of a gross, greasy basketcase to pretty in pink under the guidance of a queen bee played by (who else) Molly Ringwald. An unattractive weirdo is effectively cured when she becomes beautiful in the eyes of teenage boys. Netflix's   horror series Stranger Things, the breakaway hit of the summer, is a hefty homage to '80s genre films  —   and since repackaging tropes was always going to be part of the plan, a Classic Makeover Montage was inevitable. Directed and written by creators Matt and Ross Duffer, Stranger Things follows the aftermath of a boy named Will Byers' disappearance in 1980s Indiana. His friends  —   a motley crew of uncool, Dungeons  Dragons —  playing middle school boys  —   attempt to find him with the help of an escapee from a government facility, who has been groomed into a telekinetic weapon. The escapee's name and approximate age is Eleven. Played by a very talented Millie Bobby Brown, Eleven is   scrappy, loyal, and brave. Her hair is completely shaved, since the government experimenters who raised her were constantly attaching and reattaching   nodes to her head. Her imminent makeover, therefore, is different than your basic       —   she was raised in a brutal and presumably genderless way by force. But a makeover is a makeover. Will's friend Mike (Finn Wolfhard) in whose basement Eleven has sought refuge, helps her put on his older sister's makeup and clothes so she can take a trip to their school without rousing suspicion. The end result  —   frilly, feminine, pink  —   has Eleven looking like a miniature version of Ally Sheedy, brand new and beautified, emerging from Saturday detention with the Brat Pack. Eleven touches her new blonde wig in front of a mirror in Mike's house. “You look pretty,” Mike tells her. “Pretty?” she asks, not sure whether to believe him. It's a word she'll repeat a few times throughout the series  —   gazing at her reflection, seeing the way Mike looks at her. While she struggles to comprehend other words the boys introduce, “pretty” is one that Eleven understands immediately and intimately. She was robbed of an entire childhood, but having been denied prettiness seems to be one of her short life's greatest sadnesses. Eleven is at home in a long history of young female characters whose ultimate worth is dictated by her romantic appeal to boys  —   someone who must first become desirably feminine before she can fully claim that worthiness at all. That premise is all the more galling in a show where Eleven is a) the hero, and b) prepubescent. Why on earth does she need to be worrying about attracting boys when she's a literal child  —   one preoccupied with saving people in mortal danger, no less? Even though Eleven didn't make the choice to shave her head, Stranger Things presumes that the   is girlhood's default, a natural and obvious preference. To be   pop culture tells us, is to be weird, abnormal, ugly, bad (in another word: queer). Prescribed femininity is therefore a  : If a girl can be pretty, she can be available to men. And in 2016, as in the '80s, a girl is still supposed to be both. Boyish girls remain rather rare in mainstream film and television. When they do show up, their boyishness tends to be a problem to be corrected. Sometimes a tomboy's masculinity is merely temporary, a costume to be put on and taken off  —   like with Andrea, played Alana Austin, in the Disney movie Motocrossed: she dresses up like her twin brother to race as him, inspiring the lesbian awakenings of so many '90s kids. As with Amanda Bynes in She's the Man, Motocrossed's girl ends up safely femme and partnered with a boyfriend by the time the credits roll. In other cases, masculinity in girl characters can be attributed to their sportiness, but the films have to work extra hard to assure that  —   don't worry!  —   even though the girl is tough and strong, she's still pretty and sought after by boys. In 2002's Bend It Like Beckham, Keira Knightley's   and tomboyish Jules, a soccer player, is continually suspected of being a lesbian, particularly by her mom Jules continually denies the accusations, which becomes one of the film's running jokes. Despite an insane amount of chemistry with her best friend and teammate Jess, played by Parminder Nagra, viewers are constantly hit over the head with the apparent fact of Jules' heterosexuality, particularly when both Jules and Jess somewhat inconceivably fall for their male coach. Then there are the   girls who are just one of the boys, a bro among bros. In another John Hughes —  penned '80s film, Some Kind Of Wonderful, Mary Stuart Masterson is Watts, a working class teen tomboy who's BFFs with Eric Stoltz' Keith. Watts helps Keith try to land a popular girl, the way a good wingman does, but in the end Keith realizes that he's actually in love with his best friend  —   which he expresses by giving Watts a pair of earrings originally intended for the girl he'd been pursuing earlier. Watts is thrilled. What    tomboy doesn't covet a pair of expensive, girly earrings? If a girl's masculinity can't be corrected with compulsory femininity, she's a lost cause: the butt of a joke at best, something monstrous at worst. Queerness  —   which could encompass a character's sexuality, or simply be signified by a deviant gender presentation  —   has been demonized throughout horror film history. The monstrous queer has cropped up in everything from   films like Silence Of The Lambs and Monster to ‘80s slasher movies, inciting highbrow and lowbrow terror in near equal measure. Just as queerness in any shape or form is a threat to heteronormativity, a figure like Dracula is a threat when seducing the men and women he preys upon, whom he renders  —   through penetration and the exchange of bodily fluids  —   just as villainous as he is. Eleven in Stranger Things isn't a threat the way a lot of classic horror villains are, but what matters is she sees herself that way. When experimenters force her to push the bounds of her telekinesis, she unwittingly creates a tear in space and time, opening a gate to an alternate dimension (“the Upside Down”) which leads a monster out into the real world. As days pass and Will Byers still hasn't been found, Eleven is wracked with unspeakable guilt. “I'm the monster,” she tells Mike, tears pooling in her eyes. Her monstrosity, she feels, is made visually apparent by her shaved head  —   she's defective, something hideous and unlovable. In one scene, after she's run away from Mike and his friends, worried that she could hurt them or otherwise make matters worse, she leans down over a pond in the woods and screams at her reflection. If only, if only she were normal. If only she were pretty. Stranger Things, which references the work of directors like Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter, borrows ‘80s film aesthetics to marvelous effect  —   but it also borrows absurdly outdated gender politics, which are a lot less fun to watch. Eleven is defined almost exclusively by her relationships with men and boys: the evil doctor she calls “Papa” the group of geeks who go from rejecting her to defending her and, most significantly, with her friend Mike, who, after seeing her properly girlified, gets a crush on her, kisses her, and asks her to a school dance. Even though Mike still likes Eleven without the wig, which she's thankfully abandoned due to impracticality by the end of the season, her makeover allowed him to see her as someone capable of femininity, rather than just another bro. Regardless, why must any sense of her empowerment or validation come from the way a boy sees her? (And, reminder: These kids are in, like, sixth grade. They are babies.) Eleven's heroism  —   and ultimately, her potential martyrdom  —   is overshadowed by her downgrade from   victor to mourned love interest. On the whole, Stranger Things makes sure to scrub all possible traces of queerness from its characters. Bullies pick on Will, his brother, and his friends by calling them queer freaks, but that's largely an empty insult. Mike is safely paired with Eleven, while Will's brother, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) after taking enormously creepy photos of Mike's older sister Nancy as she's undressing in a window, becomes her confidante and friend. Lonely hetero geekdom is romanticized in this world  —   stalking is merely a minor offense, something that very well might be less shameful in the show's diegesis than gayness. Stranger Things champions the nerds and the weirdos, as so much of '80s pop culture did, but the writers temporarily put Eleven in a wig and make most characters seemingly straight as if to assure that their weirdness won't become unruly. Queerness,   (nonwhiteness too, for that matter)  —   in a world with monsters and alternate dimensions, these things are just too alien to make the cut. Not every character in the world needs to be LGBT. (That'd be nice, though.) The issue isn't just that there are no queer characters on so many beloved and critically acclaimed shows  —   the issue is that most characters aren't given the opportunity to be anything other than straight or  . Even female characters on TV who are actually allowed to be   openly queer are overwhelmingly feminine: Emily and her various love interests on Pretty Little Liars Clarke and her various love interests on The 100 basically everyone on The L Word (Shane's the one   exception, and she wears a ton of makeup). Lea DeLaria as Boo on Orange Is The New Black is one of the only true butches on television today. If a female character is going to be into women, she at least has to “look straight” so her queerness isn't too much of an aberration. When characters we're supposed to root for step outside the bounds of heteronormativity, so often they're forcefully shoved back into place. But Eleven is a kid. We don't know her sexual orientation and we don't need to. Yet the Duffer brothers felt compelled to give her a makeover and stick her with a boy. (She might have grown up to be with both boys and girls, of course, or no one at all, but in our culture girls are presumed straight unless proven otherwise even then, they're belittled and disbelieved.) No matter her orientation, Eleven simply doesn't deserve to be reduced to a romantic plotline with anyone. Even though Winona Ryder made a triumphant comeback as Will's mom, even though Natalia Dyer's Nancy can (wow!) shoot a gun pretty well, and even though #WeAreAllBarb, Stranger Things exists squarely in a boy's universe. And according to the laws of pop culture, boys still get to complete their heroic quest and win the girl. Another huge hit of the summer, Paul Feig's Ghostbusters, has been widely celebrated precisely because the female characters aren't winnable. They exist in their own right, as fucking badasses who save the world, instead of prizes for male protagonists' consumption. It's an exciting thing primarily because women deserve to be the heroes of their own stories. But keeping all the female characters unattached also means that Ghostbusters doesn't blanket enforce heteronormativity. Kristen Wiig's Erin gets awkwardly flirty with Chris Hemsworth's Kevin, but Melissa McCarthy as Abby is far more concerned about her friendship with Erin (and catching ghosts) than expressing romantic interest in anyone. Meanwhile, Kate McKinnon's Holtzmann seduces everything that moves (notably, in a way that doesn't simply perform for the male gaze). Ask any lesbian and she'll tell you that McKinnon's character is so obviously queer that they left the Ghostbusters theater even gayer than when they walked in. Both Feig and McKinnon won't confirm Holtzmann's sexuality, likely due to studio pressure, which is maddening in its own way. But at the very least, Holtzmann  —   who is far from the most feminine person in the world, in her neckties and whimsical overalls  —   isn't punished for her masculinity, or saddled up with a random dude. Holtzmann's rise comes one year after another female character was afforded similarly refreshing, and rare, freedoms: Charlize Theron's Furiosa in Mad Max: Fury Road. After Millie Bobby Brown, the actor who plays Eleven, shaved her head for the role, she was worried she'd made a big mistake  —   until the Duffer brothers showed her a picture of Furiosa rocking the same cut. “The resemblance was amazing!” she told IndieWire. “It was the best decision I've ever, ever made. ” The more we see women and girls embracing nontraditional gender presentations, the less vilified those presentations will become. Characters like Furiosa and Holtzmann represent the possibility that a woman could be masculine, or queer, or unattached, or some combination of the three without being forcibly feminized, given a boyfriend, or branded a monster. Stranger Things could have easily allowed Eleven to forge meaningful friendships and kick monster ass without preoccupying her with fears about prettiness. Some tropes of the ‘80 really aren't worth reviving  —   the Classic Makeover Montage is one of them.   ",False," We all know the Classic Makeover Montage well. A beautiful actress we're supposed to believe is a homely slob because her hair's a little frizzy is bestowed with a flatiron and some makeup     after a parade of product placements, she's the belle of the ball. There is perhaps no feminine transformation as famous as the one in John Hughes' The Breakfast Club, that gold standard of high school movies and launcher of a thousand teen cliches. Ally Sheedy's Allison goes from Hollywood's idea of a gross, greasy basketcase to pretty in pink under the guidance of a queen bee played by (who else) Molly Ringwald. An unattractive weirdo is effectively cured when she becomes beautiful in the eyes of teenage boys. Netflix's   horror series Stranger Things, the breakaway hit of the summer, is a hefty homage to '80s genre films     and since repackaging tropes was always going to be part of the plan, a Classic Makeover Montage was inevitable. Directed and written by creators Matt and Ross Duffer, Stranger Things follows the aftermath of a boy named Will Byers' disappearance in 1980s Indiana. His friends     a motley crew of uncool, Dungeons  Dragons   playing middle school boys     attempt to find him with the help of an escapee from a government facility, who has been groomed into a telekinetic weapon. The escapee's name and approximate age is Eleven. Played by a very talented Millie Bobby Brown, Eleven is   scrappy, loyal, and brave. Her hair is completely shaved, since the government experimenters who raised her were constantly attaching and reattaching   nodes to her head. Her imminent makeover, therefore, is different than your basic          she was raised in a brutal and presumably genderless way by force. But a makeover is a makeover. Will's friend Mike (Finn Wolfhard) in whose basement Eleven has sought refuge, helps her put on his older sister's makeup and clothes so she can take a trip to their school without rousing suspicion. The end result     frilly, feminine, pink     has Eleven looking like a miniature version of Ally Sheedy, brand new and beautified, emerging from Saturday detention with the Brat Pack. Eleven touches her new blonde wig in front of a mirror in Mike's house. You look pretty, Mike tells her. Pretty? she asks, not sure whether to believe him. It's a word she'll repeat a few times throughout the series     gazing at her reflection, seeing the way Mike looks at her. While she struggles to comprehend other words the boys introduce, pretty is one that Eleven understands immediately and intimately. She was robbed of an entire childhood, but having been denied prettiness seems to be one of her short life's greatest sadnesses. Eleven is at home in a long history of young female characters whose ultimate worth is dictated by her romantic appeal to boys     someone who must first become desirably feminine before she can fully claim that worthiness at all. That premise is all the more galling in a show where Eleven is a) the hero, and b) prepubescent. Why on earth does she need to be worrying about attracting boys when she's a literal child     one preoccupied with saving people in mortal danger, no less? Even though Eleven didn't make the choice to shave her head, Stranger Things presumes that the   is girlhood's default, a natural and obvious preference. To be   pop culture tells us, is to be weird, abnormal, ugly, bad (in another word: queer). Prescribed femininity is therefore a  : If a girl can be pretty, she can be available to men. And in 2016, as in the '80s, a girl is still supposed to be both. Boyish girls remain rather rare in mainstream film and television. When they do show up, their boyishness tends to be a problem to be corrected. Sometimes a tomboy's masculinity is merely temporary, a costume to be put on and taken off     like with Andrea, played Alana Austin, in the Disney movie Motocrossed: she dresses up like her twin brother to race as him, inspiring the lesbian awakenings of so many '90s kids.

180,73617,110167," Inside Glossier, The Beauty Startup That Just Happens To Sell Makeup",Buzzfeed News,Nitasha Tiku,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/nitashatiku/inside-glossier-the-beauty-startup-that-just-happens-to-sell
"," This summer, I paid $22 to make my face look like a freshly glazed doughnut. For weeks, Glossier, an   beauty startup with a fanatical following, had been hyping a face highlighter called Haloscope by referencing Krispy Kreme's      look (“warm on the inside, a little wet and sculpted on the outside”) in its ad copy. How had I never noticed that Original Glazed has a   glow? The desired effect is less glistening carb than Karlie Kloss on her way to barre class  —   i. e. someone more likely to Snapchat fried food than to eat it  —   but the analogy was endearing nonetheless. Twenty days after Haloscope was released, Quartz, the pearlescent pink shade, sold out. That's nothing compared to the waitlist for Boy Brow, Glossier's eyebrow pomade, which famously climbed up to 10, 000. Before restocking last month, Glossier had 60, 000 names on waitlists for its nine skin care and makeup products, which the company releases in limited collections every few months. In the two years since Glossier launched, it has hired 44 employees (many of whom double as models) and raised $10. 4 million in venture capital financing over a seed and series A round. Revenue, meanwhile, is on track to grow 600% in 2016, and the company expects to grow several hundred percent next year as well. Fashion and beauty blogs now cover the company's font choice, packaging, product launches, and inevitable product sellouts like Apple fanboys awaiting WWDC. More than 267, 000 people follow the brand on Instagram. Its signature   pink has become so iconic that fans use the hashtag #glossierpink when they see the color in the wild: on a surfboard, a San Francisco Victorian, a mural in India, “aura crystals,” a rosy cocktail at a rooftop bar in Chelsea. According to Emily Weiss, Glossier's    founder, most customers come from    and fall into the enviable    age bracket. Glossier has fans in Kloss (whose Instagram selfie sporting a branded sweatshirt got 27, 000 likes) and in Eva Chen, former    of Lucky and current head of fashion partnerships at Instagram (who calls the brand “phenomenal”) and, probably, in the most effortlessly luminous young woman in your office, group text, or Twitter feed. The brand quickly ascended to cult status through a curious alchemy of market research, calculated intimacy, and the ineffable coolness of its founder, figurehead, and often model, Weiss. A magnetic former fashion assistant at W and Vogue, she had a brief but memorable stint on The Hills as an uptight “super intern,” flown in from NY as a foil to Lauren Conrad's West Coast casual work ethic. While she was still at Vogue masthead, Weiss started the beauty and fashion blog Into the Gloss, known for a column called “The Top Shelf,” which features interviews with    It girls, revered magazine editors, future   muses, models, entrepreneurs, and the occasional heiress, some of whom spilled the secrets of their beauty routines while Weiss sat on their bathroom floor. Glossier used the community that formed around the blog to create a dossier (hence the name) of skin care and makeup for consumers to build out their own top shelves. “It was never a pivot,” Weiss told me during a recent visit to her office in lower Manhattan. The move from Into the Gloss to Glossier, she explained, was “a total evolution of the same mission, but with tactile content. ” Sure, but not every blogger's move toward “tactile content” could be so seamless. In order to make her pitch to the masses, Weiss has had to reposition herself not as the super intern who knows the makeup secrets of the stars, but as your best friend or benevolent big sister. In her letter introducing the company, Weiss said she wanted to welcome everyone. “Snobby isn't cool, happy is cool,” she wrote. Part of the thrill of being a Glossier girl is the proximity to Weiss, her   workforce, and her company's hella 'grammable Soho headquarters. She is one of a cohort of aspirational founders of   startups in NY City  —   including her good friends Leandra Medine of Man Repeller and Sophia Amoruso of Nasty Gal. Sitting in a   conference room wearing a pair of vintage white Levi's that she picked up on her honeymoon to Tokyo, she resembles a Nancy Meyers version of a millennial girlboss: beautiful but not too intimidating, appreciably ambitious but almost always smiling, neurotic  —   but in a charming way. After sitting down to our interview, Weiss got up immediately to straighten a rack of postcards behind me. “Sorry,” she said, “it's going to drive me crazy if it's crooked. ” Glossier's office looks like its Instagram account come to life. The white walls are covered in ethereal mood boards in dreamy pastels. Wooden chairs are outfitted in chic fur shrugs.    arched windows look out safely at the cityscape below. The lacquered conference table is long, lean, and  . And on every floor, employees radiate good health and subtle highlighter. This is the kind of office where an administrative coordinator or   engineer can, and does, double as a model for the company's Instagram account, FaceTime tutorials, and Facebook Live videos. On YouTube, Glossier hosts a feature called “Get Ready With Me,” where the person (often a Glossier employee) walks the viewer through their morning routine. On a recent summer day, the office was buoyant over big news: The company had just restocked its lipsticks and concealers, which combined had a waitlist 30, 000   customers long. They celebrated for a few minutes with cupcakes covered in stiff pink frosting with miniature replicas of the sleek Generation G tubes on top, as well as breakfast parfait cups and   breakfast sandwiches. The cupcakes got Instagrammed, but not the sandwiches. Perfect for a Snapchat story, one employee told another as they walked away from the table, fancy cupcakes untouched. To understand what makes Glossier popular, start with its sales pitch. The line promises a barely there,    effect that plays up features instead of masking flaws, though of course this works better when your “flaw” is a cute scar, winsome snaggletooth, or freckles  —   not cystic acne, purple   bags, or a hirsute chin. Words like “imperceptible” and “sheer” pepper the site's ad copy, and aside from its lipsticks, a newer addition, Glossier's products aren't really meant to be noticed at all. “We always err on a light touch versus a heavy touch,” Weiss explained, meaning “there's never going to be some kind of explosion: ‘Oh my god, I've overdone it! There's too much product  —   I have to wipe some off. '” Haloscope definitely can't be overdone, I told Weiss  —   believe me, I'd tried. “It's hard!” she replied, smiling. “It's so subtle. If anything, the criticism would be that our products are too subtle than too intense. But I think that's so important to be able to build. So few of us are makeup artists. We want the products to be universally flattering, to be very intuitive, very easy. ” None of the products require brushes it's all designed to be slapped on in the back of the cab. “Glossier is makeup for the truly lazy” was The Frisky's assessment, but make no mistake  —   laziness in this case means studied effortlessness, not puffy and   six hours deep into a Netflix binge still caked with the remnants of last night's mascara. The look is “trying hard but not trying to look like you're trying hard,” said Munachi Ikedionwu, a blogger and Vanderbilt University premed student. Palm trees and   coconuts are a recurring motif on Glossier's posters and stickers, which come free with every order. Packages arrive in a brown box with that   interior, plastered with slogans like “SKIN FIRST. MAKEUP SECOND. SMILE ALWAYS” and “SKINCARE IS ESSENTIAL. MAKEUP IS A CHOICE. (MAKE GOOD CHOICES). ” Inside it, the makeup itself comes in a bag made of pink bubble wrap that doubles as a clutch so cute the company sells them à la carte, three for $12. Website copy is just arch enough not to sound too 13 Going on 30: “The      in you is freaking out right now,” declares the description for Generation G Boy Brow's implores you to “Brush your teeth, brush your brows, and then maybe brush your hair. ” Packaging channels the hopeful futurism of the '80s (“as opposed to the the whole '90s   thing,” executive editor Annie Kreighbaum said, “which is not so cool for us”). To hype Haloscope, Glossier flooded its Instagram with pics of a shimmering tulle skirt cascading down a runway, a   horse on a beach, and of course, doughnuts. If the references are familiar to you, it feels whimsical as fuck. A teenage daydream, elevated and commoditized. A series of coded signals for a certain kind of girl. “The people seeing Sofia Coppola movies, they're also buying Glossier,” said Natalie Guevara, a    who works in communications for the   startup Genius. “It's very much taking the Coppola aesthetic  —   the dusky pink and supple skin  —   and making it something tangible that you can buy. ” It's a far cry from the heavy colors and oozing lipstick logo for Kylie Cosmetics() or even Milk Makeup, which goes by the slogan “cool girls get ready quick,” and traffics in     products that offer effects like “an iridescent,   sheen” or “  color in one swipe. ” Glossier never explicitly says whether these are the bad makeup choices it warned you against, but its aesthetic is subdued and refined, more Connecticut (where Weiss grew up) than Calabasas. Glossier girls probably keep up with the Kardashians, but they don't want to look like them. The products themselves tend to be   . Glossier's concealer feels impossibly light and looks incredibly natural, even if it settles into fine lines. Milky Jelly is a   treat, but doesn't remove my mascara. I'm not entirely sure Haloscope is visible on me, but when I put the products on in the morning I feel destined for a compliment. Surely all this radiance will turn some heads. At any rate, the Coppola comparison is real: Weiss gave the director one of her lipsticks and then Instagrammed a handwritten   note. Coppola loved the shade Crush. Glossier typically gets lumped in as a startup because it “launched” on Instagram, but that was just a savvy promotion strategy. People had to leave the app to buy the goods, and the company still had to set up a website, buy dynamic online ads, and advertise in the subway just like every other   hopeful. Glossier's real innovation was optimizing for the internet at every step: using the tools of the social web to turn readers into followers and followers into brand evangelists, unpaid product advisers, and, maybe, something like a community, albeit one that buys things from you. “We really want to listen very closely to our audience across all our channels,” Weiss told me. That means talking to customers through FaceTime videos and Instagram comments, and using Into the Gloss's robust commentariat as an updated take on a focus group: The formula for Milky Jelly Cleanser, a nonfoaming, ultralight face wash, came largely out of a post titled “What's Your Dream Cleanser?” in which Weiss encouraged readers to answer that question, “   stories encouraged. ” “We will do our best to compile what you tell us into one helluva Glossier cleanser,” Weiss wrote 382 comments and almost a year later, Milky Jelly was released. Power users are invited to sign up for a special, confidential Slack group. NY —  area ones are invited to the Glossier penthouse for “a night of mystery product testing, pizza, rosé, and g. IRL talk with other members of the Glossier community and CEO and Founder Emily Weiss!” If in 2016 brands are your friend, Glossier wants to be your BFF. (Or at least talk like her.) The nondisclosure agreement doesn't come until later. “Copy plays a huge part,” explained Kreighbaum. It's important to be “personable and   . You can have ‘real girls,' but if you're not being casual with your language, it gets lost. ” Kreighbaum became a social media star in her own right after her lush, unrepentant eyebrows were featured prominently in campaigns for Glossier's Boy Brow product. “Maybe my eyebrows are more famous than I am? I hear they do well on our paid ads,” she told me. She was a beauty blogger before Weiss recruited her through a Twitter DM. “I think they thought I was funny. A lot of beauty writing didn't have as much personality,” said Kreighbaum. “It kind of comes naturally to me to overshare. ” Indeed, there's something intimate and cliquish, almost conspiratorial, about the brand. “You're part of this crowd and you don't want to stray from it too much,” said Claire Carusillo, a    beauty blogger who puts out a charmingly unhinged newsletter called My Second or Third Skin. In other words, even if Balm Dotcom, Glossier's   salve, is essentially   Vaseline, pulling a tube out on the subway still feels good. “When you get really hyped about something, you kind of lie to yourself,” Carusillo told me. “Like, ‘This is the stuff! '” Perhaps tellingly, Glossier sells nine beauty products and four items of merch, including an enamel pin in the shape of the company's signature gothic “G” ($14) and the very sweatshirt Kloss took viral ($60). “Ordinarily, I just buy stuff off of Amazon and the drugstore,” said Guevara, the Coppola fan. “In many ways, Glossier is one of the first brands that I've subscribed to. When Boy Brow runs out, I order more. ” It's all part of the contemporary dance between consumers and   companies, in which the brand is never supposed to look like it's selling something, and people buying it roll their eyes if the artifice grows too lame. “Trying hard to not look like you're trying hard” doesn't just describe the Glossier look, it describes the company's whole corporate ethos, from its chatty, familiar ad copy to the gap teeth on its “real girl” models.   makeup is a perfect complement to   commerce. “It doesn't feel like we're being sold products  —   it's much more like a lifestyle play,” said Chen, comparing Glossier to Supreme, the widely worshipped streetwear apparel company. But where lifestyle purveyors like Supreme try to stay a   secret as long as possible, Weiss has pulled off a feat of branding gymnastics: She's taken   signifiers and made them seem accessible to the masses, and she's created a Glossier girl whose definition is broad enough to include anyone with $12 to spend on a lip balm, but particular enough that it still feels exclusive. Take Glossier's recent Instagram post advertising a   shop in Amagansett. (Spelling out “the Hamptons” might look basic.) Or the company's “soothing face mist,” a   and   water that promises to “hydrate, soothe, and leave you feeling fresh and awake. ” No one needs to spray flower water on their face, but at $18 for a bottle, it's an attainable kind of indulgence. All in all, the Glossier's cheapest item is $12, and the most expensive is $26  —   more than drugstore brands, but less pricey than much of the stuff you'd find at Sephora. Folu Akinkuotu, a    Boston resident who works in business development for an   company, said she became a Glossier customer precisely because because of that calibrated accessibility. It's big departure from Into the Gloss, which featured the kind of people who “buy containers of La Mer cream once a week   …     Cool. That's my rent. ” Glossier, she said, is different. “It's not snapshots from this movie star's bathroom. It's like, ‘Here, this is for you. '” Guevara also found the blog inaccessible, but stressed that the vibe at Glossier's   stores in downtown Manhattan have been very different. At an event in January where Glossier sales clerks were dressed in lab overcoats so chic that attendees asked where they could buy them, Guevara said “there was something about it that was very sort of homey. ” “I would kind of eyeroll at that kind of scene if it was held at Barneys,” she continued. But “there was no shame if you want to come in just to Snapchat or take selfies. ” Kirsten Green, the founder of Forerunner Ventures, one of Glossier's first investors, described Glossier as “democratic in its offering, while still being cool and practical, not making a bunch of promises [but] celebrating who you are. ” And Glossier fans like Chen will tell you about the exquisite specificity of the world that the brand created, but never give details when you ask for  . Kreighbaum said there's no archetype of the Glossier girl: “I think it's more important to us to be your friend. ” At the company's office, Weiss told me that Glossier's goal is “to make women proud of where they're at every day. That can mean you're on your way to getting promoted but you haven't gotten promoted yet and that's okay. Or you know you just broke up and you're sad and crying and that's okay. We want to kind of feel all the feelings, you know what I mean?” In person, Weiss's voice has a sturdier timbre than you might expect from her delicate frame. She's luminous and slight, but authoritative in the breadth of her knowledge about the industry and Glossier's game plan. Her lower jaw juts out when she smiles, which she does often, and she has the warmth and pep of a coach on the sidelines. If she'd asked me to take a knee in front of a mood board, I would have. “Emily Weiss was this sort of figurehead to me,” said Carusillo, who started reading Into the Gloss in college. “She's so beautiful. She seems to have a really gorgeous life. I looked to her for so many years as a     cool girl. ” This spring, Medine was photographed at Paris Fashion Week carrying one of the little pink bubble wrap pouches that Glossier uses to cushion packages during shipping. A month later, Jimmy Choo offered its own version of the bubble wrap bag for $950. In the notoriously hierarchical fashion world, Weiss and her cohort get   seats at shows and walk the occasional red carpet. Buying Glossier products is an entrée into this world, into a fantasy plane where Emily Blunt from The Devil Wears Prada wants to give you the keys to the fashion closet  —   before she started eating carbs again. But there's a reason movies don't center around the cool popular girl who is also nice and helpful: It's hard to make that believable. Weiss' brand of accessible coolness is a fitting mood for our age of nascent   when a teen girl's bible is Rookie, not Seventeen cover girls can also be activists and, for a while at least, a   gazelle like Taylor Swift could position herself as the awkward outcast. The fashion industry scouts talent directly from Instagram these days, and so does Glossier. The result is a rotating cast of ethnically diverse and genetically blessed models whose full lips and youthful glow  —   and, of course, taut frames  —   would give you   whiplash on the street. But that outward emphasis on diversity didn't save Glossier from an uproar in the fall of 2014 when the company released its Perfecting Skin Tint in only three shades (the “dark” was still pretty light). On the message board Get Off My Internets, one commenter wrote that she loved a recent “Top Shelf” feature on Into the Gloss featuring a   woman. “[I]t felt like acknowledgement that black girls get to play in the ‘pretty girls club' too. So the three shades was a slap in the fucking face. ” Weiss and her team tried to assuage ITG readers who brought up the same complaint, explaining that a broader range of skin tints was already in the works. And the company did better than bounce back. Shoppers whose skin doesn't match the beauty industry's definition of “nude” can use Glossier's shade finder tool or watch quick videos on the product pages of Glossier. com showing women with an array of different skin tones demonstrating more shades of the skin tint in natural light. Reflecting the widest array of shoppers is good business  —   after all, exclusivity has a   cap on consumers. The more people who feel like part of the pretty girl club, the more makeup Glossier can sell. In a post for xoVain, beauty editor Tynan Sinks tried to untangle why he has such a personal connection with the brand. “[M]aybe it's because Glossier feels inclusive, like any of us could be a cool Glossier girl,” adding, parenthetically, “all I've ever wanted to be is a cool girl, but the sad truth is I'm just a   bitch. ” Wouldn't you know it, Glossier even has a slogan for that exact state of mind: “Everyone says they're ‘low maintenance.' (It's okay, neither are we. )” Even the line's critics admit that the branding is on point. On Makeup Alley, a secretive message board for aficionados, one commenter wrote: “I don't rly get the glossier hype its like, they took all the most raved about products on intothegloss and just duped them. ” But, the poster added, “in cute packaging. ” The way Weiss tells it, Glossier sprang organically out of Into the Gloss's community, but the company also smartly positioned itself at the nexus of a few big trends. Search for “no makeup tutorial” on YouTube and you'll find almost 2. 6 million videos “natural makeup tutorial” gets 1. 2 million results. Korean beauty, which emphasizes flawless skin above all else, is booming stateside in 2015, South Korea exported more than $2. 6 billion of cosmetics goods, up from $1 billion in 2012, according to the BBC. Glossier was ahead of the curve, but the number of products to help women look like they woke up like this could fill a Sephora. At the same time, Glossier was one of the first in a new wave of beauty brands built to float in a viral soup of YouTube tutorials, “Instagram makeup,” influencers, and beauty bloggers, where skeptical millennials with no brand loyalty can find a   guide or product review on just about anything. Specialty chains like Sephora and Ulta are winning out over department stores, which works in the favor of newer, smaller brands. When Kendall Jenner was named the new face of Estée Lauder in late 2014, the company called the social media sphinx “the ultimate instagirl. ” Macy's, which launched in 1858, is currently worth $4 billion less than Ulta, which isn't even a decade old. “It used to be you needed to have footage inside a big store,” said Karen Grant, beauty analyst for NPD Group, a market research firm. “Now you just need a following. ” When Weiss was out fundraising, investors wanted to compare Glossier to other   brands  —   e. g. “the Warby Parker of x. ” “We got to a point where we had to say no,” Weiss told me. Glossier wasn't selling online in order to offer a price cut or incentives like promotions or subscriptions. “We're using the channel to build a better brand, period. We're using the channel to actually involve the customer in ways she's never been allowed or invited to become involved [in order] to build an incredibly inclusive movement like a better, more modern brand, which is going to become default. ” Subtract the buzzwords, dial down the egalitarian   and Weiss has a fairly novel concept. Armed with all the intimate intel gleaned from so many comment sections and Slack groups, Glossier has carved out a niche for itself in the new lane of   consumer goods that feel luxurious because they're customized to your needs. Weiss likes to use the phrase “redefining luxury” to describe an individualized experience that caters to the customer. “If you go to a Hermès store or something, you hope they remember you from your last  …    ”  —   Weiss struggled to come up with something  —   “$10, 000 purchase? I dunno. ” But websites can do that through cookies. “Luxury today is getting what you want, how you want it, when you want it, getting a very personalized experience,” Weiss continued. Uber started out under the branding of “everyone's private driver”  —   another version of the “what you want, when you want it” line. Silicon Valley investors pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into meal delivery startups for the same reason. If you're looking for a lucrative exit, it's a good time to be in   right now. “The major brands are making an effort to gobble up” smaller companies, said Grant. The market is shifting quickly to adjust to millennial buyers (  creams are out, highlighters and contours are in) YouTube stars, and Korean beauty. Investors have heeded the call. Last winter, Ipsy, a subscription service like Birchbox   by social media mogul Michelle Phan, raised $100 million. In July, Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital acquired a controlling stake in Carver Korea, which makes specialty   cosmetics. And earlier this month, Memebox, an   platform for   products, raised $66 million from tech investors. Memebox deals with Korean manufacturers, who are known for producing   cosmetics with a fast turnaround. Glossier, on the other hand, traffics in a small line of products that are released slowly and sell out quickly. The company experimented with 40 different formulas for Milky Jelly, instead of the more typical three or four, before settling on the same gentle cleansing ingredient found in contact lens solution. Almost a year passed between Weiss's original   post and when the product was available online. That's awfully slow compared to ColourPop, the Los Angeles —  based company behind Kylie Jenner's lipstick line, which uses the fast fashion model to create “on trend products that are amazingly of the moment at record speed. ” The company works with several chemists, but would not disclose their names, saying it was “beauty industry standard to keep that information confidential. ” Glossier was also   about production and would only divulge that it's actively working with six product manufacturers across North America, although needs change depending on new formulas or categories. And Milky Jelly sold out, as almost all of Glossier's products do at some point or another. (“The waitlist thing has been really  …     It makes us so sad when we can't give people what they want. Period,” said Weiss when I repeated the beauty blog rumor that the sellouts were a sales gimmick. Kurt Jetta, founder of the research firm TABS Analytics, referred to the industry's obsession with selling out as engendering “borderline hysteria. ”) But even if Glossier is not the brand to scale affordable luxury in cosmetics, the underlying idea is still an intoxicating proposition for people whose demands outstrip their disposable income. It's an inch closer to the consumer power shift toward buyers that the “thinkfluencers” have been talking about for more than a decade. Just imagine if you could tell Trader Joe's that you really wanted chocolate chips in your cookie butter, but with less fat and more viscosity. Or ask J. Crew to offer more lightweight cardigans and fewer sequined pineapple ruffles. And then the company (kinda) listened! And sold you something (sorta) like that? Consumers want customization everybody wants to be heard. Green, who sits on the board of Bonobos and Dollar Shave Club as well as Glossier, said that her investment thesis relies on this concept. Amazon has already won on price and convenience. And the abundance of choice has pushed   to adapt from the “  format” of the   era. “The way that our lives digitally are evolving, it's almost like we can have a real relationship with people via technology, and the expectation is that you can have that with brands, too. ” There's the friend request again. The morning that I visited Glossier's office, Weiss, Kreighbaum, creative director Helen Steed (who's also filled the same role at Bumble and Bumble and Jawbone) and Adriana Deleo, the company's head of design, were gathered to look at the results of a new photo shoot the pictures were ultimately used to promote the fact that all five shades of its Skin Tint were back in stock. Kreighbaum was wearing a taupe dress that looked like an oversize   hoop earrings, and black sandals with chunky heels and thick crisscrossing straps. On the poster board were photographs of radiant girls, including an Asian woman, an Indian woman, and a black woman posing in plain white tank tops in front of a blue background like angels from American Apparel heaven. The Indian woman, Alisha Bansal, is a student at Barnard who interns at Christie's. Another was a Glossier intern. “They're all real girls. A lot of them we found on Instagram from tagging us in their selfies because they use our products,” said Kreighbaum. (Her trick to scouring Instagram: tagged photos, which give a more realistic idea of what someone looks like.) According to the market research firm L2, “Brands are not yet seeing the same post fatigue on Instagram as they did on Facebook  —   followers are not becoming disengaged with more brand content. ” But that only works if commerce stays hidden and companies post and share like a person. (This is also why every brand on Twitter wants to be your lit pizza bae AF.) If Glossier is your friend, it follows that the brand's social media and ad campaigns would include photos that look like ones your friends would take. Instead of using DSLRs to shoot campaigns, “we're transitioning to shooting stuff more on the iPhone,” because it's more natural, said Kreighbaum. And rather than traditional shots, the company tends to show off new items using Boomerangs and videos, so, in the words of Chen, “it feels like they're communicating with their audience the exact way the audience consumes on Instagram. ” Glossier retouches its photos, but minimally, according to Kreighbaum and Weiss. “If a retoucher did what they would normally do, it would feel so flat,” Kreighbaum said. “I think that's why people take a second look at them, because they're so raw in comparison. ” Kreighbaum said that when they build out a world for campaigns, they try to make sure “nothing is too fantastical. ” Others will “build this set of a bathtub filled with flowers, wind through the hair. ” With Glossier, it's more like, “Oh, our friend has a cool bathroom, let's shoot there. ” She didn't elaborate on how many of Glossier's customers have cool bathrooms themselves. Weiss still gets asked about The Hills, which has now been off the air for a decade. I started following Glossier purely out of fascination with the icy intern who tried to make hero LC look bad. But when I watched it again, I felt worse for Weiss. Her reality TV crime was knowing too much. “It was totally true what they portrayed in terms of me being hardworking,” said Weiss. “But in terms of me being an antagonist, they kind of had their production hat on to create this dynamic. I was just trying to impress my boss. ” Weiss claims to have mellowed out over the years. “It's funny because I was super serious. As a    in work scenarios, I just wanted to do a great job,” she said. “Now I'm just older and I like to operate [differently]. For example, our company couldn't be further from the fashion magazine environment. ” Behind Weiss, the mood boards and trendy young women were visible through the glass conference room wall. She continued: “I think I'm just more chilled, and it probably doesn't hurt that I am the boss. Now I just want to impress my employees. ” This winter, Weiss wrote a post about the many, many things she did to get ready for her wedding. (Jezebel seized on the colonic part.) Isn't that antithetical to the whole “be happy where you are” thing? “I would actually argue that,” she replied, warmly. “It's very easy to say that this is the opposite of Glossier,” Weiss explained however, “Glossier is not saying that everyone should be low maintenance. Glossier is about not shaming however you interpret beauty. Glossier is for the girl on YouTube who has a   beauty routine and leaves the house with a full face of makeup every day because that's how she feels best. And it's for someone who puts on moisturizer and leaves because that's how she feels best. ” How did I end up with a soliloquy on  ? I have no idea, but I found myself nodding along. “Does that make sense?” she asked. “You should do whatever it is that makes you the most happy, and so before a wedding, I mean, yeah,” she said, as though it were only natural. She took it even further. “I love the conversation that that created!” Weiss said. “There are people who said, ‘Wow that is so crazy high maintenance,' and there are people who said, ‘Wow, I did 10 times that! '” “Emily is one of those people whose brain works on a different kind of plane,” said Chen. “You know how hummingbirds fly at a different velocity than other birds? Emily's brain is that way, where she's four to six steps ahead of everything. ” However Weiss's brain is vibrating, it appears to be working. The company doesn't yet ship internationally, but Guevara said she's even encountered it in the Dominican Republic, where she grew up. Friends “arrange for family members in Miami to receive shipments, which is crazy. ” They discovered the brand on Instagram. ●  ",False," This summer, I paid $22 to make my face look like a freshly glazed doughnut. For weeks, Glossier, an   beauty startup with a fanatical following, had been hyping a face highlighter called Haloscope by referencing Krispy Kreme's      look (warm on the inside, a little wet and sculpted on the outside) in its ad copy. How had I never noticed that Original Glazed has a   glow? The desired effect is less glistening carb than Karlie Kloss on her way to barre class     i. e. someone more likely to Snapchat fried food than to eat it     but the analogy was endearing nonetheless. Twenty days after Haloscope was released, Quartz, the pearlescent pink shade, sold out. That's nothing compared to the waitlist for Boy Brow, Glossier's eyebrow pomade, which famously climbed up to 10, 000. Before restocking last month, Glossier had 60, 000 names on waitlists for its nine skin care and makeup products, which the company releases in limited collections every few months. In the two years since Glossier launched, it has hired 44 employees (many of whom double as models) and raised $10. 4 million in venture capital financing over a seed and series A round. Revenue, meanwhile, is on track to grow 600% in 2016, and the company expects to grow several hundred percent next year as well. Fashion and beauty blogs now cover the company's font choice, packaging, product launches, and inevitable product sellouts like Apple fanboys awaiting WWDC. More than 267, 000 people follow the brand on Instagram. Its signature   pink has become so iconic that fans use the hashtag #glossierpink when they see the color in the wild: on a surfboard, a San Francisco Victorian, a mural in India, aura crystals, a rosy cocktail at a rooftop bar in Chelsea. According to Emily Weiss, Glossier's    founder, most customers come from    and fall into the enviable    age bracket. Glossier has fans in Kloss (whose Instagram selfie sporting a branded sweatshirt got 27, 000 likes) and in Eva Chen, former    of Lucky and current head of fashion partnerships at Instagram (who calls the brand phenomenal) and, probably, in the most effortlessly luminous young woman in your office, group text, or Twitter feed. The brand quickly ascended to cult status through a curious alchemy of market research, calculated intimacy, and the ineffable coolness of its founder, figurehead, and often model, Weiss. A magnetic former fashion assistant at W and Vogue, she had a brief but memorable stint on The Hills as an uptight super intern, flown in from NY as a foil to Lauren Conrad's West Coast casual work ethic. While she was still at Vogue masthead, Weiss started the beauty and fashion blog Into the Gloss, known for a column called The Top Shelf, which features interviews with    It girls, revered magazine editors, future   muses, models, entrepreneurs, and the occasional heiress, some of whom spilled the secrets of their beauty routines while Weiss sat on their bathroom floor. Glossier used the community that formed around the blog to create a dossier (hence the name) of skin care and makeup for consumers to build out their own top shelves. It was never a pivot, Weiss told me during a recent visit to her office in lower Manhattan. The move from Into the Gloss to Glossier, she explained, was a total evolution of the same mission, but with tactile content.  Sure, but not every blogger's move toward tactile content could be so seamless. In order to make her pitch to the masses, Weiss has had to reposition herself not as the super intern who knows the makeup secrets of the stars, but as your best friend or benevolent big sister. In her letter introducing the company, Weiss said she wanted to welcome everyone. Snobby isn't cool, happy is cool, she wrote. Part of the thrill of being a Glossier girl is the proximity to Weiss, her   workforce, and her company's hella 'grammable Soho headquarters. She is one of a cohort of aspirational founders of   startups in NY City     including her good friends Leandra Medine of Man Repeller and Sophia Amoruso of Nasty Gal. Sitting in a   conference room wearing a pair of vintage white Levi's that she picked up on her honeymoon to Tokyo, she resembles a Nancy Meyers version of a millennial girlboss: beautiful but not too intimidating, appreciably ambitious but almost always smiling, neurotic     but in a charming way. After sitting down to our interview, Weiss got up immediately to straighten a rack of postcards behind me. Sorry, she said, it's going to drive me crazy if it's crooked.  Glossier's office looks like its Instagram account come to life. The white walls are covered in ethereal mood boards in dreamy pastels. Wooden chairs are outfitted in chic fur shrugs.    arched windows look out safely at the cityscape below. The lacquered conference table is long, lean, and  . And on every floor, employees radiate good health and subtle highlighter. This is the kind of office where an administrative coordinator or   engineer can, and does, double as a model for the company's Instagram account, FaceTime tutorials, and Facebook Live videos. On YouTube, Glossier hosts a feature called Get Ready With Me, where the person (often a Glossier employee) walks the viewer through their morning routine. On a recent summer day, the office was buoyant over big news: The company had just restocked its lipsticks and concealers, which combined had a waitlist 30, 000   customers long. They celebrated for a few minutes with cupcakes covered in stiff pink frosting with miniature replicas of the sleek Generation G tubes on top, as well as breakfast parfait cups and   breakfast sandwiches. The cupcakes got Instagrammed, but not the sandwiches. Perfect for a Snapchat story, one employee told another as they walked away from the table, fancy cupcakes untouched. To understand what makes Glossier popular, start with its sales pitch. The line promises a barely there,    effect that plays up features instead of masking flaws, though of course this works better when your flaw is a cute scar, winsome snaggletooth, or freckles     not cystic acne, purple   bags, or a hirsute chin. Words like imperceptible and sheer pepper the site's ad copy, and aside from its lipsticks, a newer addition, Glossier's products aren't really meant to be noticed at all. We always err on a light touch versus a heavy touch, Weiss explained, meaning there's never going to be some kind of explosion: Oh my god, I've overdone it! There's too much product     I have to wipe some off. ' Haloscope definitely can't be overdone, I told Weiss     believe me, I'd tried. It's hard! she replied, smiling. It's so subtle. If anything, the criticism would be that our products are too subtle than too intense. But I think that's so important to be able to build. So few of us are makeup artists. We want the products to be universally flattering, to be very intuitive, very easy.  None of the products require brushes it's all designed to be slapped on in the back of the cab. Glossier is makeup for the truly lazy was The Frisky's assessment, but make no mistake     laziness in this case means studied effortlessness, not puffy and   six hours deep into a Netflix binge still caked with the remnants of last night's mascara. The look is trying hard but not trying to look like you're trying hard, said Munachi Ikedionwu, a blogger and Vanderbilt University premed student. Palm trees and   coconuts are a recurring motif on Glossier's posters and stickers, which come free with every order. Packages arrive in a brown box with that   interior, plastered with slogans like SKIN FIRST. MAKEUP SECOND. SMILE ALWAYS and SKINCARE IS ESSENTIAL. MAKEUP IS A CHOICE. (MAKE GOOD CHOICES).  Inside it, the makeup itself comes in a bag made of pink bubble wrap that doubles as a clutch so cute the company sells them  la carte, three for $12. Website copy is just arch enough not to sound too 13 Going on 30: The      in you is freaking out right now, declares the description for Generation G Boy Brow's implores you to Brush your teeth, brush your brows, and then maybe brush your hair.  Packaging channels the hopeful futurism of the '80s (as opposed to the the whole '90s   thing, executive editor Annie Kreighbaum said, which is not so cool for us). To hype Haloscope, Glossier flooded its Instagram with pics of a shimmering tulle skirt cascading down a runway, a   horse on a beach, and of course, doughnuts. If the references are familiar to you, it feels whimsical as fuck. A teenage daydream, elevated and commoditized. A series of coded signals for a certain kind of girl. The people seeing Sofia Coppola movies, they're also buying Glossier, said Natalie Guevara, a    who works in communications for the   startup Genius. It's very much taking the Coppola aesthetic     the dusky pink and supple skin     and making it something tangible that you can buy.  It's a far cry from the heavy colors and oozing lipstick logo for Kylie Cosmetics() or even Milk Makeup, which goes by the slogan cool girls get ready quick, and traffics in     products that offer effects like an iridescent,   sheen or   color in one swipe.  Glossier never explicitly says whether these are the bad makeup choices it warned you against, but its aesthetic is subdued and refined, more Connecticut (where Weiss grew up) than Calabasas. Glossier girls probably keep up with the Kardashians, but they don't want to look like them. The products themselves tend to be   . Glossier's concealer feels impossibly light and looks incredibly natural, even if it settles into fine lines. Milky Jelly is a   treat, but doesn't remove my mascara. I'm not entirely sure Haloscope is visible on me, but when I put the products on in the morning I feel destined for a compliment. Surely all this radiance will turn some heads. At any rate, the Coppola comparison is real: Weiss gave the director one of her lipsticks and then Instagrammed a handwritten   note. Coppola loved the shade Crush. Glossier typically gets lumped in as a startup because it launched on Instagram, but that was just a savvy promotion strategy. People had to leave the app to buy the goods, and the company still had to set up a website, buy dynamic online ads, and advertise in the subway just like every other   hopeful. Glossier's real innovation was optimizing for the internet at every step: using the tools of the social web to turn readers into followers and followers into brand evangelists, unpaid product advisers, and, maybe, something like a community, albeit one that buys things from you. We really want to listen very closely to our audience across all our channels, Weiss told me. That means talking to customers through FaceTime videos and Instagram comments, and using Into the Gloss's robust commentariat as an updated take on a focus group: The formula for Milky Jelly Cleanser, a nonfoaming, ultralight face wash, came largely out of a post titled What's Your Dream Cleanser? in which Weiss encouraged readers to answer that question,    stories encouraged.  We will do our best to compile what you tell us into one helluva Glossier cleanser, Weiss wrote 382 comments and almost a year later, Milky Jelly was released. Power users are invited to sign up for a special, confidential Slack group. NY   area ones are invited to the Glossier penthouse for a night of mystery product testing, pizza, ros, and g. IRL talk with other members of the Glossier community and CEO and Founder Emily Weiss! If in 2016 brands are your friend, Glossier wants to be your BFF. (Or at least talk like her.) The nondisclosure agreement doesn't come until later. Copy plays a huge part, explained Kreighbaum. It's important to be personable and   . You can have real girls,' but if you're not being casual with your language, it gets lost.  Kreighbaum became a social media star in her own right after her lush, unrepentant eyebrows were featured prominently in campaigns for Glossier's Boy Brow product. Maybe my eyebrows are more famous than I am? I hear they do well on our paid ads, she told me. She was a beauty blogger before Weiss recruited her through a Twitter DM. I think they thought I was funny. A lot of beauty writing didn't have as much personality, said Kreighbaum. It kind of comes naturally to me to overshare.  Indeed, there's something intimate and cliquish, almost conspiratorial, about the brand. You're part of this crowd and you don't want to stray from it too much, said Claire Carusillo, a    beauty blogger who puts out a charmingly unhinged newsletter called My Second or Third Skin. In other words, even if Balm Dotcom, Glossier's   salve, is essentially   Vaseline, pulling a tube out on the subway still feels good. When you get really hyped about something, you kind of lie to yourself, Carusillo told me. Like, This is the stuff! ' Perhaps tellingly, Glossier sells nine beauty products and four items of merch, including an enamel pin in the shape of the company's signature gothic G ($14) and the very sweatshirt Kloss took viral ($60). Ordinarily, I just buy stuff off of Amazon and the drugstore, said Guevara, the Coppola fan. In many ways, Glossier is one of the first brands that I've subscribed to. When Boy Brow runs out, I order more.  It's all part of the contemporary dance between consumers and   companies, in which the brand is never supposed to look like it's selling something, and people buying it roll their eyes if the artifice grows too lame. Trying hard to not look like you're trying hard doesn't just describe the Glossier look, it describes the company's whole corporate ethos, from its chatty, familiar ad copy to the gap teeth on its real girl models.   makeup is a perfect complement to   commerce. It doesn't feel like we're being sold products     it's much more like a lifestyle play, said Chen, comparing Glossier to Supreme, the widely worshipped streetwear apparel company. But where lifestyle purveyors like Supreme try to stay a   secret as long as possible, Weiss has pulled off a feat of branding gymnastics: She's taken   signifiers and made them seem accessible to the masses, and she's created a Glossier girl whose definition is broad enough to include anyone with $12 to spend on a lip balm, but particular enough that it still feels exclusive. Take Glossier's recent Instagram post advertising a   shop in Amagansett. (Spelling out the Hamptons might look basic.) Or the company's soothing face mist, a   and   water that promises to hydrate, soothe, and leave you feeling fresh and awake.  No one needs to spray flower water on their face, but at $18 for a bottle, it's an attainable kind of indulgence. All in all, the Glossier's cheapest item is $12, and the most expensive is $26     more than drugstore brands, but less pricey than much of the stuff you'd find at Sephora. Folu Akinkuotu, a    Boston resident who works in business development for an   company, said she became a Glossier customer precisely because because of that calibrated accessibility. It's big departure from Into the Gloss, which featured the kind of people who buy containers of La Mer cream once a week        Cool. That's my rent.  Glossier, she said, is different. It's not snapshots from this movie star's bathroom. It's like, Here, this is for you. ' Guevara also found the blog inaccessible, but stressed that the vibe at Glossier's   stores in downtown Manhattan have been very different. At an event in January where Glossier sales clerks were dressed in lab overcoats so chic that attendees asked where they could buy them, Guevara said there was something about it that was very sort of homey.  I would kind of eyeroll at that kind of scene if it was held at Barneys, she continued. But there was no shame if you want to come in just to Snapchat or take selfies.  Kirsten Green, the founder of Forerunner Ventures, one of Glossier's first investors, described Glossier as democratic in its offering, while still being cool and practical, not making a bunch of promises [but] celebrating who you are.  And Glossier fans like Chen will tell you about the exquisite specificity of the world that the brand created, but never give details when you ask for  . Kreighbaum said there's no archetype of the Glossier girl: I think it's more important to us to be your friend.  At the company's office, Weiss told me that Glossier's goal is to make women proud of where they're at every day. That can mean you're on your way to getting promoted but you haven't gotten promoted yet and that's okay. Or you know you just broke up and you're sad and crying and that's okay. We want to kind of feel all the feelings, you know what I mean? In person, Weiss's voice has a sturdier timbre than you might expect from her delicate frame. She's luminous and slight, but authoritative in the breadth of her knowledge about the industry and Glossier's game plan. Her lower jaw juts out when she smiles, which she does often, and she has the warmth and pep of a coach on the sidelines. If she'd asked me to take a knee in front of a mood board, I would have. Emily Weiss was this sort of figurehead to me, said Carusillo, who started reading Into the Gloss in college. She's so beautiful. She seems to have a really gorgeous life. I looked to her for so many years as a     cool girl.  This spring, Medine was photographed at Paris Fashion Week carrying one of the little pink bubble wrap pouches that Glossier uses to cushion packages during shipping. A month later, Jimmy Choo offered its own version of the bubble wrap bag for $950. In the notoriously hierarchical fashion world, Weiss and her cohort get   seats at shows and walk the occasional red carpet. Buying Glossier products is an entre into this world, into a fantasy plane where Emily Blunt from The Devil Wears Prada wants to give you the keys to the fashion closet     before she started eating carbs again. But there's a reason movies don't center around the cool popular girl who is also nice and helpful: It's hard to make that believable. Weiss' brand of accessible coolness is a fitting mood for our age of nascent   when a teen girl's bible is Rookie, not Seventeen cover girls can also be activists and, for a while at least, a   gazelle like Taylor Swift could position herself as the awkward outcast. The fashion industry scouts talent directly from Instagram these days, and so does Glossier. The result is a rotating cast of ethnically diverse and genetically blessed models whose full lips and youthful glow     and, of course, taut frames     would give you   whiplash on the street. But that outward emphasis on diversity didn't save Glossier from an uproar in the fall of 2014 when the company released its Perfecting Skin Tint in only three shades (the dark was still pretty light). On the message board Get Off My Internets, one commenter wrote that she loved a recent Top Shelf feature on Into the Gloss featuring a   woman. [I]t felt like acknowledgement that black girls get to play in the pretty girls club' too. So the three shades was a slap in the fucking face.  Weiss and her team tried to assuage ITG readers who brought up the same complaint, explaining that a broader range of skin tints was already in the works. And the company did better than bounce back. Shoppers whose skin doesn't match the beauty industry's definition of nude can use Glossier's shade finder tool or watch quick videos on the product pages of Glossier. com showing women with an array of different skin tones demonstrating more shades of the skin tint in natural light. Reflecting the widest array of shoppers is good business     after all, exclusivity has a   cap on consumers. The more people who feel like part of the pretty girl club, the more makeup Glossier can sell. In a post for xoVain, beauty editor Tynan Sinks tried to untangle why he has such a personal connection with the brand. [M]aybe it's because Glossier feels inclusive, like any of us could be a cool Glossier girl, adding, parenthetically, all I've ever wanted to be is a cool girl, but the sad truth is I'm just a   bitch.  Wouldn't you know it, Glossier even has a slogan for that exact state of mind: Everyone says they're low maintenance.' (It's okay, neither are we. ) Even the line's critics admit that the branding is on point. On Makeup Alley, a secretive message board for aficionados, one commenter wrote: I don't rly get the glossier hype its like, they took all the most raved about products on intothegloss and just duped them.  But, the poster added, in cute packaging.  The way Weiss tells it, Glossier sprang organically out of Into the Gloss's community, but the company also smartly positioned itself at the nexus of a few big trends. Search for no makeup tutorial on YouTube and you'll find almost 2. 6 million videos natural makeup tutorial gets 1. 2 million results. Korean beauty, which emphasizes flawless skin above all else, is booming stateside in 2015, South Korea exported more than $2. 6 billion of cosmetics goods, up from $1 billion in 2012, according to the BBC. Glossier was ahead of the curve, but the number of products to help women look like they woke up like this could fill a Sephora. At the same time, Glossier was one of the first in a new wave of beauty brands built to float in a viral soup of YouTube tutorials, Instagram makeup, influencers, and beauty bloggers, where skeptical millennials with no brand loyalty can find a   guide or product review on just about anything. Specialty chains like Sephora and Ulta are winning out over department stores, which works in the favor of newer, smaller brands. When Kendall Jenner was named the new face of Este Lauder in late 2014, the company called the social media sphinx the ultimate instagirl.  Macy's, which launched in 1858, is currently worth $4 billion less than Ulta, which isn't even a decade old. It used to be you needed to have footage inside a big store, said Karen Grant, beauty analyst for NPD Group, a market research firm. Now you just need a following.  When Weiss was out fundraising, investors wanted to compare Glossier to other   brands     e. g. the Warby Parker of x.  We got to a point where we had to say no, Weiss told me. Glossier wasn't selling online in order to offer a price cut or incentives like promotions or subscriptions. We're using the channel to build a better brand, period. We're using the channel to actually involve the customer in ways she's never been allowed or invited to become involved [in order] to build an incredibly inclusive movement like a better, more modern brand, which is going to become default.  Subtract the buzzwords, dial down the egalitarian   and Weiss has a fairly novel concept. Armed with all the intimate intel gleaned from so many comment sections and Slack groups, Glossier has carved out a niche for itself in the new lane of   consumer goods that feel luxurious because they're customized to your needs. Weiss likes to use the phrase redefining luxury to describe an individualized experience that caters to the customer. If you go to a Herms store or something, you hope they remember you from your last           Weiss struggled to come up with something     $10, 000 purchase? I dunno.  But websites can do that through cookies. Luxury today is getting what you want, how you want it, when you want it, getting a very personalized experience, Weiss continued. Uber started out under the branding of everyone's private driver     another version of the what you want, when you want it line. Silicon Valley investors pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into meal delivery startups for the same reason. If you're looking for a lucrative exit, it's a good time to be in   right now. The major brands are making an effort to gobble up smaller companies, said Grant. The market is shifting quickly to adjust to millennial buyers (  creams are out, highlighters and contours are in) YouTube stars, and Korean beauty. Investors have heeded the call. Last winter, Ipsy, a subscription service like Birchbox   by social media mogul Michelle Phan, raised $100 million. In July, Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital acquired a controlling stake in Carver Korea, which makes specialty   cosmetics. And earlier this month, Memebox, an   platform for   products, raised $66 million from tech investors. Memebox deals with Korean manufacturers, who are known for producing   cosmetics with a fast turnaround. Glossier, on the other hand, traffics in a small line of products that are released slowly and sell out quickly. The company experimented with 40 different formulas for Milky Jelly, instead of the more typical three or four, before settling on the same gentle cleansing ingredient found in contact lens solution. Almost a year passed between Weiss's original   post and when the product was available online. That's awfully slow compared to ColourPop, the Los Angeles   based company behind Kylie Jenner's lipstick line, which uses the fast fashion model to create on trend products that are amazingly of the moment at record speed.  The company works with several chemists, but would not disclose their names, saying it was beauty industry standard to keep that information confidential.  Glossier was also   about production and would only divulge that it's actively working with six product manufacturers across North America, although needs change depending on new formulas or categories. And Milky Jelly sold out, as almost all of Glossier's products do at some point or another. (The waitlist thing has been really       It makes us so sad when we can't give people what they want. Period, said Weiss when I repeated the beauty blog rumor that the sellouts were a sales gimmick. Kurt Jetta, founder of the research firm TABS Analytics, referred to the industry's obsession with selling out as engendering borderline hysteria. ) But even if Glossier is not the brand to scale affordable luxury in cosmetics, the underlying idea is still an intoxicating proposition for people whose demands outstrip their disposable income. It's an inch closer to the consumer power shift toward buyers that the thinkfluencers have been talking about for more than a decade. Just imagine if you could tell Trader Joe's that you really wanted chocolate chips in your cookie butter, but with less fat and more viscosity. Or ask J. Crew to offer more lightweight cardigans and fewer sequined pineapple ruffles. And then the company (kinda) listened! And sold you something (sorta) like that? Consumers want customization everybody wants to be heard. Green, who sits on the board of Bonobos and Dollar Shave Club as well as Glossier, said that her investment thesis relies on this concept. Amazon has already won on price and convenience. And the abundance of choice has pushed   to adapt from the   format of the   era. The way that our lives digitally are evolving, it's almost like we can have a real relationship with people via technology, and the expectation is that you can have that with brands, too.  There's the friend request again. The morning that I visited Glossier's office, Weiss, Kreighbaum, creative director Helen Steed (who's also filled the same role at Bumble and Bumble and Jawbone) and Adriana Deleo, the company's head of design, were gathered to look at the results of a new photo shoot the pictures were ultimately used to promote the fact that all five shades of its Skin Tint were back in stock. Kreighbaum was wearing a taupe dress that looked like an oversize   hoop earrings, and black sandals with chunky heels and thick crisscrossing straps. On the poster board were photographs of radiant girls, including an Asian woman, an Indian woman, and a black woman posing in plain white tank tops in front of a blue background like angels from American Apparel heaven. The Indian woman, Alisha Bansal, is a student at Barnard who interns at Christie's. Another was a Glossier intern. They're all real girls. A lot of them we found on Instagram from tagging us in their selfies because they use our products, said Kreighbaum. (Her trick to scouring Instagram: tagged photos, which give a more realistic idea of what someone looks like.) According to the market research firm L2, Brands are not yet seeing the same post fatigue on Instagram as they did on Facebook     followers are not becoming disengaged with more brand content.  But that only works if commerce stays hidden and companies post and share like a person. (This is also why every brand on Twitter wants to be your lit pizza bae AF.) If Glossier is your friend, it follows that the brand's social media and ad campaigns would include photos that look like ones your friends would take. Instead of using DSLRs to shoot campaigns, we're transitioning to shooting stuff more on the iPhone, because it's more natural, said Kreighbaum. And rather than traditional shots, the company tends to show off new items using Boomerangs and videos, so, in the words of Chen, it feels like they're communicating with their audience the exact way the audience consumes on Instagram.  Glossier retouches its photos, but minimally, according to Kreighbaum and Weiss. If a retoucher did what they would normally do, it would feel so flat, Kreighbaum said. I think that's why people take a second look at them, because they're so raw in comparison.  Kreighbaum said that when they build out a world for campaigns, they try to make sure nothing is too fantastical.  Others will build this set of a bathtub filled with flowers, wind through the hair.  With Glossier, it's more like, Oh, our friend has a cool bathroom, let's shoot there.  She didn't elaborate on how many of Glossier's customers have cool bathrooms themselves. Weiss still gets asked about The Hills, which has now been off the air for a decade. I started following Glossier purely out of fascination with the icy intern who tried to make hero LC look bad. But when I watched it again, I felt worse for Weiss. Her reality TV crime was knowing too much. It was totally true what they portrayed in terms of me being hardworking, said Weiss. But in terms of me being an antagonist, they kind of had their production hat on to create this dynamic. I was just trying to impress my boss.  Weiss claims to have mellowed out over the years. It's funny because I was super serious. As a    in work scenarios, I just wanted to do a great job, she said. Now I'm just older and I like to operate [differently]. For example, our company couldn't be further from the fashion magazine environment.  Behind Weiss, the mood boards and trendy young women were visible through the glass conference room wall. She continued: I think I'm just more chilled, and it probably doesn't hurt that I am the boss. Now I just want to impress my employees.  This winter, Weiss wrote a post about the many, many things she did to get ready for her wedding. (Jezebel seized on the colonic part.) Isn't that antithetical to the whole be happy where you are thing? I would actually argue that, she replied, warmly. It's very easy to say that this is the opposite of Glossier, Weiss explained however, Glossier is not saying that everyone should be low maintenance. Glossier is about not shaming however you interpret beauty. Glossier is for the girl on YouTube who has a   beauty routine and leaves the house with a full face of makeup every day because that's how she feels best. And it's for someone who puts on moisturizer and leaves because that's how she feels best.  How did I end up with a soliloquy on  ? I have no idea, but I found myself nodding along. Does that make sense? she asked. You should do whatever it is that makes you the most happy, and so before a wedding, I mean, yeah, she said, as though it were only natural. She took it even further. I love the conversation that that created! Weiss said. There are people who said, Wow that is so crazy high maintenance,' and there are people who said, Wow, I did 10 times that! ' Emily is one of those people whose brain works on a different kind of plane, said Chen. You know how hummingbirds fly at a different velocity than other birds? Emily's brain is that way, where she's four to six steps ahead of everything.  However Weiss's brain is vibrating, it appears to be working. The company doesn't yet ship internationally, but Guevara said she's even encountered it in the Dominican Republic, where she grew up. Friends arrange for family members in Miami to receive shipments, which is crazy.  They discovered the brand on Instagram.   "
181,73618,110169, Facebook Must Either Innovate Or Admit Defeat At The Hands Of Fake News Hoaxsters,Buzzfeed News,Craig Silverman,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-facebook-fell-into-a-fake-news-trap-of-its-own-making
"," It's taken nearly two years, but this week clearly showed how Facebook's approach to battling fake news has failed. Only a fews days after the company laid off the human editors who managed its Trending Topics and related news articles, a false story about Fox News host Megyn Kelly became a top Trending Topic on the platform for nearly 24 hours. Facebook's algorithm saw the story was being widely shared and talked about so it added it to the trending sidebar, thereby promoting the false story to potentially millions more people. It's not a surprise that a false story was trending in the first place. A research project I conducted in 2014 found that false rumors and hoaxes attract more engagement on Facebook than the related debunkings. This is particularly true when it comes to fake news items, which are hoaxes published by websites that look like real news sites but are created to fool people. The data I found showed that fake news could drive massive numbers of likes, shares, and comments on Facebook, while any attempts at debunking it would receive a fraction of the engagement. (Remember that Facebook is now the biggest driver of traffic to news websites.) For example, this October 2014 hoax claiming the Earth will experience six days of darkness had racked up nearly 900, 000 likes, shares and comments on Facebook. The combined Facebook interactions of seven different debunkings from places such as Snopes and the Huffington Post amounted to a little more than 136, 000. Nearly two years later, fake news sites continue to flourish on Facebook. Just look at the two Canadian teenagers I found who are making thousands of dollars just from hoaxes about Justin Trudeau. Or this coordinated effort to seed fake articles about terrorist attacks in Facebook groups in order to drive people to malicious websites. Fake news sites are now also joined by a new breed of   websites and Facebook pages that generate huge engagement on Facebook with content that's often false or deeply misleading. One of these sites, EndingTheFed. com, published the false Megyn Kelly article that Facebook made a Trending Topic. This is all happening close to two years since Facebook announced it would enable people to flag content in their News Feed that was false or deliberately misleading. The goal was to blunt the impact of fake news. It failed. Then, yesterday in Italy, a student asked Mark Zuckerberg if Facebook sees itself as an editor when it comes to news on its platform. “No, we are a tech company, not a media company,” he said. These three things  —   reliance on users to flag fake news, firing Trending Topic editors in favor of an algorithm, and Zuckerberg's insistence that Facebook is not a media company  —   together show how Facebook has been caught in a fake news trap of its own making. The company is faced with a choice to either innovate or admit defeat at the hands of fake news hoaxsters and   click farmers. Here's why: Facebook insists it's not a media company, which means it does not want editors making calls about what is and isn't news, or choosing which sources to highlight. So goodbye, human editors. People at Facebook have also told me they do not want to blacklist even the worst of the fake news websites, since that in their view is akin to editorial oversight and censorship. (The company is probably even more wary of blacklists after its Trending Topics editors were accused of suppressing conservative websites.) Meanwhile, Facebook is fine with users flagging fake content, but there's no evidence people are doing this to any useful degree  —   and in fact this feature can easily be used as a weapon to silence people. All of this means Facebook's only option  —   and clear preference  —   is to develop an algorithm that uses signals gathered on its platform to determine which topics should be labeled Trending, and which articles within those topics should be highlighted. This needs to happen while also making sure the algorithm identifies and eliminates fake, false, or defamatory topics and stories. The flaw with this current approach is Facebook itself. The algorithm has a huge reliance on signals such as the likes, shares, comments, and reading time that a posted article gets  —   and when it comes to news, Facebook is incredibly biased. The false story about Kelly is a perfect example. Ending the Fed publishes highly partisan content that is often totally false or misleading. But it's precisely because of how partisan it is, and because of the way it writes headlines and packages its content for Facebook, that it gets huge engagement on the platform. False content often gives off great signals on Facebook. John Herrman wrote about the rise of these   political websites and Facebook pages for the NY Times Magazine. They all take advantage of the fact that people are more likely to positively engage with and share information that aligns with their beliefs. Echoing what the    kid running a profitable fake news operation told me, these sites tell people what they want to hear. Or, more accurately, they aggressively and divisively cater to existing beliefs and keep people in a filter bubble, often thanks to information that is false or incredibly misleading. This kind of content quite literally makes people feel good when they read it because it reinforces what they believe. And so they like it, and share it, and email it to friends, and post enthusiastic comments about it on Facebook. Then their friends with the same beliefs do the same. Any Facebook algorithm looking for news stories with strong engagement signals is going to surface these stories, and they are going to look great. The algorithm might check how many other sites have published a story about the same thing  —   multiple sources, right!  —   and it will find lots of other articles, because   sites and fake news sites constantly republish (or steal) each other's content. There's a good chance the copycat stories may be doing well on Facebook, too. That's how total bullshit gets to the top of Trending Topics, courtesy of an algorithm. And why it will probably happen again and again. Facebook's   approach inevitably falls victim to the biases of the platform, which themselves are a reflection of our own human biases. It's ironic that one solution is to apply more humans to the problem, but the Trending Topic editors had previously proven fairly effective at keeping fake stories off the sidebar. At this point, it's possible that Facebook may decide Trending Topics isn't worth the effort and controversy and will kill the product. There is, however, one alternative positive scenario I could see unfolding as a result of Facebook's doubling down on the Trending Topic algorithm. If the company is truly committed to offering a quality Trending Topic (and News Feed) experience, then its only option is to make massive strides in the detection and analysis of the factual qualities of news articles. Developing what would likely be the world's first algorithm to do this job with accuracy and consistency will require significant engineering resources. But it's what's necessary to actually stop Facebook from being the world's biggest platform for false and fake news  —   and to get there without editors. Right now Facebook has no editors, a flawed algorithm, and a weak product. The past two years have seen Facebook articulate what it will and won't do when it comes to fake news. The question now is whether it actually cares enough to make its approach work.  ",False," It's taken nearly two years, but this week clearly showed how Facebook's approach to battling fake news has failed. Only a fews days after the company laid off the human editors who managed its Trending Topics and related news articles, a false story about Fox News host Megyn Kelly became a top Trending Topic on the platform for nearly 24 hours. Facebook's algorithm saw the story was being widely shared and talked about so it added it to the trending sidebar, thereby promoting the false story to potentially millions more people. It's not a surprise that a false story was trending in the first place. A research project I conducted in 2014 found that false rumors and hoaxes attract more engagement on Facebook than the related debunkings. This is particularly true when it comes to fake news items, which are hoaxes published by websites that look like real news sites but are created to fool people. The data I found showed that fake news could drive massive numbers of likes, shares, and comments on Facebook, while any attempts at debunking it would receive a fraction of the engagement. (Remember that Facebook is now the biggest driver of traffic to news websites.) For example, this October 2014 hoax claiming the Earth will experience six days of darkness had racked up nearly 900, 000 likes, shares and comments on Facebook. The combined Facebook interactions of seven different debunkings from places such as Snopes and the Huffington Post amounted to a little more than 136, 000. Nearly two years later, fake news sites continue to flourish on Facebook. Just look at the two Canadian teenagers I found who are making thousands of dollars just from hoaxes about Justin Trudeau. Or this coordinated effort to seed fake articles about terrorist attacks in Facebook groups in order to drive people to malicious websites. Fake news sites are now also joined by a new breed of   websites and Facebook pages that generate huge engagement on Facebook with content that's often false or deeply misleading. One of these sites, EndingTheFed. com, published the false Megyn Kelly article that Facebook made a Trending Topic. This is all happening close to two years since Facebook announced it would enable people to flag content in their News Feed that was false or deliberately misleading. The goal was to blunt the impact of fake news. It failed. Then, yesterday in Italy, a student asked Mark Zuckerberg if Facebook sees itself as an editor when it comes to news on its platform. No, we are a tech company, not a media company, he said. These three things     reliance on users to flag fake news, firing Trending Topic editors in favor of an algorithm, and Zuckerberg's insistence that Facebook is not a media company     together show how Facebook has been caught in a fake news trap of its own making. The company is faced with a choice to either innovate or admit defeat at the hands of fake news hoaxsters and   click farmers. Here's why: Facebook insists it's not a media company, which means it does not want editors making calls about what is and isn't news, or choosing which sources to highlight. So goodbye, human editors. People at Facebook have also told me they do not want to blacklist even the worst of the fake news websites, since that in their view is akin to editorial oversight and censorship. (The company is probably even more wary of blacklists after its Trending Topics editors were accused of suppressing conservative websites.) Meanwhile, Facebook is fine with users flagging fake content, but there's no evidence people are doing this to any useful degree     and in fact this feature can easily be used as a weapon to silence people. All of this means Facebook's only option     and clear preference     is to develop an algorithm that uses signals gathered on its platform to determine which topics should be labeled Trending, and which articles within those topics should be highlighted. This needs to happen while also making sure the algorithm identifies and eliminates fake, false, or defamatory topics and stories. The flaw with this current approach is Facebook itself. The algorithm has a huge reliance on signals such as the likes, shares, comments, and reading time that a posted article gets     and when it comes to news, Facebook is incredibly biased. The false story about Kelly is a perfect example. Ending the Fed publishes highly partisan content that is often totally false or misleading. But it's precisely because of how partisan it is, and because of the way it writes headlines and packages its content for Facebook, that it gets huge engagement on the platform. False content often gives off great signals on Facebook. John Herrman wrote about the rise of these   political websites and Facebook pages for the NY Times Magazine. They all take advantage of the fact that people are more likely to positively engage with and share information that aligns with their beliefs. Echoing what the    kid running a profitable fake news operation told me, these sites tell people what they want to hear. Or, more accurately, they aggressively and divisively cater to existing beliefs and keep people in a filter bubble, often thanks to information that is false or incredibly misleading. This kind of content quite literally makes people feel good when they read it because it reinforces what they believe. And so they like it, and share it, and email it to friends, and post enthusiastic comments about it on Facebook. Then their friends with the same beliefs do the same. Any Facebook algorithm looking for news stories with strong engagement signals is going to surface these stories, and they are going to look great. The algorithm might check how many other sites have published a story about the same thing     multiple sources, right!     and it will find lots of other articles, because   sites and fake news sites constantly republish (or steal) each other's content. There's a good chance the copycat stories may be doing well on Facebook, too. That's how total bullshit gets to the top of Trending Topics, courtesy of an algorithm. And why it will probably happen again and again. Facebook's   approach inevitably falls victim to the biases of the platform, which themselves are a reflection of our own human biases. It's ironic that one solution is to apply more humans to the problem, but the Trending Topic editors had previously proven fairly effective at keeping fake stories off the sidebar.

","'For example, try to post about your car windows being smashed, and you'll be prompted with this message:' 'Try to describe someone with just a racial characteristic, and you'll see this prompt, asking you to be more descriptive:'] Nextdoor, a   social network for neighbors that has more than 10 million registered users, is rolling out a new tool today that the company says has reduced incidents of racial profiling on its network by 75% during tests. In recent years, so many people have used Nextdoor to report things like black men driving cars or hispanic women knocking on doors as suspicious or even criminal that the site has become known as a hub for racial profiling. The new tool, an algorithmic form for reporting crime and safety issues, has been in beta for an   portion of Nextdoor's 108, 000 neighborhood groups since May. This feature, which automatically identifies racially coded terms and prevents users from posting without supplemental descriptors, goes live for all users today. “The impact of being racially profiled in general is terrible,” CEO Nirav Tolia told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday. “It runs counter to the mission of Nextdoor. It's something we feel morally obligated to take seriously. ” Racial profiling became an issue for Nextdoor in 2015, when a number of news outlets reported on the frequency of posts about crime or suspicious behavior that mentioned an individual's race, but little or nothing related to actual criminal activity. In many cases, these posts would refer to people of color doing things such as talking on the phone or walking a dog. Tolia said it wasn't the bad press, but the work of civic groups in Oakland that brought the issue to his attention. Nextdoor touts its collaborations with police departments, city governments, and other public agencies. Last fall, Oakland Vice Mayor Annie Campbell Washington encouraged Oakland city departments to stop using the app to communicate with citizens until Nextdoor addressed the issue of racial profiling. By October, Tolia's team was holding working groups with advocacy groups and city officials, and together they came up with a solution. The idea, which Tolia credits to members of a group called Neighbors for Racial Justice, was to change the way crime and safety issues are reported on Nextdoor. Instead of a blank text box and subject line, it was suggested that Nextdoor design a form that more closely resembles a police report or 911 dispatcher questionnaire. By explicitly requesting details about height, clothing, and age, they would discourage people filing reports from focusing exclusively on the race or ethnicity of the subject. Nextdoor features a wide variety of post categories  —   Classifieds, Events, etc.  —   but it's the Crime and Safety section where people tend to focus on race to the exclusion of other salient details. As of today, Nextdoor neighbors posting a “crime” or “suspicious behavior” to the site will be warned against allowing an individual's race to color their interpretation of events. And if their post focuses too much on the race or ethnicity of the subject, they'll be prevented from publishing it. “When race is invoked, we create a higher bar,” Tolia explained. Nextdoor claims this new   system has, so far, reduced instances of racial profiling by 75%. It's also decreased considerably the number of notes about crime and safety. During testing, the number of crime and safety issue reports abandoned before being published rose by 50%. “It's a fairly significant dropoff,” said Tolia, “but we believe that, for Nextdoor, quality is more important than quantity. ” Vice Mayor Washington said she's “thrilled” with the results Nextdoor has achieved. “I don't think a lot of technology companies would have taken the steps they did, and made significant changes to their platform,” she said. When tech companies come under fire for failing to take race issues seriously  —   Snapchat, Twitter, and Airbnb are examples  —   critics often assert that, were minorities better represented on the staffs of those companies, the same mistakes might not have been made. But Tolia, who himself identifies as a person of color, said that while he's working actively to diversify Nextdoor's staff, when it comes to racial profiling, “we believe we get the best information from our members, and in this case, our advisers. ” But not all of Nextdoor's advisers on the racial profiling project are satisfied with how the process turned out. Two founding members of Neighbors for Racial Justice, Audrey Williams and Shikira Porter, said Nextdoor left them out of the development process after a flurry of early interest. Porter told BuzzFeed News that she continues to see instances of racial profiling in her Nextdoor neighborhood despite the rollout of the form. Nextdoor confirmed that the company has not met with Neighbors for Racial Justice since the test pilot began in April, but said it was made aware of only two instances of racial profiling that had slipped through its algorithms in the last few months. “We've been doing the work of consultants for them, and they've been taking it as free,   volunteer advice from the community,”said Williams, who works in digital marketing. “And we've been happy to give it, because it makes our lives better. But over time, it began to feel a bit like exploitation. ” Nextdoor will hold a conference call for local stakeholders on Wednesday, but neither Williams nor Porter will be able to attend. Porter said it “didn't feel right” to have Neighbors for Racial Justice attached to a project they felt the organization hadn't been given a chance to sign off on. “We appreciate working with [Neighbors for Racial Justice] to create these improvements,” said Tolia in a   email. “We are encouraged by the progress, but know there is still more work to do. ” However, it's clear that the contributions of Neighbors for Racial Justice and other local organizations to Nextdoor's efforts were integral to the design and execution of the final product. Some of the copy Nextdoor ended up using in the form  —   such as, “Ask yourself, ‘Is what I saw actually suspicious, if I take race or ethnicity out of the question? '”  —   came at the suggestion of Neighbors for Racial Justice. The new racial profiling form isn't the only change Nextdoor has made in service of tempering racial profiling on its platform. Last November, the company introduced a checkbox that allows users to flag posts for racial profiling. More recently, it's trained the group of   customer service representatives that reviews such posts in conflict resolution and “cultural humility” with an eye towards helping users understand why their posts were flagged, and how racial profiling negatively impacts whole communities. It's unusual for a tech company to take such an active role in policing its users, or to make an investment in educating them about social and cultural issues. In addition to relying on community members, Nextdoor also hired consultants to help, among other things, define what racial profiling outside of a police setting even is. Debo Adegbile, a civil rights attorney with the NAACP who was nominated for US assistant attorney general by Obama, and Grande Lum, a race relations expert with the Department of Justice, both worked as advisers to Nextdoor. Because the new form makes it less likely that users will post to Nextdoor, Tolia said there's a “business cost to doing this. ” But given the way Airbnb, Twitter, and other tech companies have struggled with issues of race in recent months, it's easy to see Tolia's decision to meet the racial profiling problem   not just as morality, but also as good business sense. “Let's not be fooled,” said Audrey Williams of Neighbors for Racial Justice. “It's a win for us, and it's a win for them. ”  ",False,"'For example, try to post about your car windows being smashed, and you'll be prompted with this message:' 'Try to describe someone with just a racial characteristic, and you'll see this prompt, asking you to be more descriptive:'] Nextdoor, a   social network for neighbors that has more than 10 million registered users, is rolling out a new tool today that the company says has reduced incidents of racial profiling on its network by 75% during tests.

183,73620,110172, These Two Dads Almost Lost Their Son In A Bizarre Surrogacy Case,Buzzfeed News,Tamar Lewin,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/tamarlewin/wisconsin-surrogacy-case
"," Jay Timmons and Rick Olson, a married gay couple from Virginia, didn't think they'd have any trouble becoming the legal parents of the baby boy their surrogate, a Wisconsin woman, delivered for them last year. They had gotten the frozen embryo that became their son as a gift from straight friends whose in vitro fertilization created more embryos than they could use. They had chosen a Wisconsin surrogate specifically because the state's Supreme Court had upheld surrogacy, and other   couples had had smooth sailing there. And by just about any measure, the two intended fathers were prime parent material: They both had good jobs, they had been together for 25 years, and they were already raising two daughters from previous surrogacies. But their careful plans went awry the month before their son, Jacob, was born, when their effort to be named his legal parents landed before a conservative judge who saw surrogacy as a form of human trafficking. Over the next 11 months, the couple's bizarre legal battle cost more than $400, 000 and kept them in constant terror of losing their son. “We didn't have one night's peace,'' Timmons, 54, a conservative Christian and president of the National Association of Manufacturers, told BuzzFeed News. “We'd wake up absolutely panicked, around 2 in the morning, and talk about the fact that we didn't know what was going to happen. ” The couple took out second and third mortgages to cover the legal fees, and Olson, 49, quit his job as a federal lobbyist for Capital One to manage the proceedings. Over the last couple of years, a handful of   surrogacy lawsuits have cropped up in U. S. courts. In California, a surrogate named Melissa Cook refused a man's wishes to abort one of the triplets she was carrying for him. And in a Pennsylvania, The View   Sherri Shepherd tried, unsuccessfully, to pull out of a contract with a pregnant surrogate after splitting up with her husband. But the Wisconsin case is likely unprecedented, legal experts say, in that the surrogate, her husband, and the intended parents were all happy with their arrangement. Only the judge was not. The case was a “judicial hijacking,” Melissa Brisman, a surrogacy lawyer in New Jersey, told BuzzFeed News. “We're at a time when a lot of people are still very committed to the idea that family values means straight married couples who have sex are the only ones who should have babies. ” In June the couple won the case, thanks in large part to the judge's abrupt resignation. Although the proceedings had played out in closed court, once it was over, supporters of Timmons and Olson provided copies of court transcripts, briefs, and filings to BuzzFeed News. And although the case is certainly an anomaly among the thousands of surrogacy arrangements made in the US every year, it underscores how, in certain areas of the country, surrogacy has become a flashpoint for cultural debates about   marriage, reproductive rights, and the booming fertility industry. Dane County Circuit Court Judge Jim Troupis, appointed by Gov Scott Walker last year, opened his March opinion with the statement, “Human trafficking comes in many forms. ” And although he went on to describe the two dads as a “spectacular set of parents'' who would raise the child “in a nurturing environment with unmatched financial resources,'' he made it clear that he was bothered by the fact that the couple had paid a woman to carry a baby who was not related to them. “The fundamental fact remains that another couple has provided the child as a gift to the petitioners, and the child has no genetic relationship to the petitioners,'' Troupis wrote. “In order to bring the child into world, the petitioners have paid a significant amount of money. Without those payments there would be no child. '' Surrogacy is unquestionably expensive: Even before they ran into trouble and began accruing bills from a dozen different lawyers, the Virginia men paid $35, 000 to their surrogate and another $12, 500 to the Wisconsin agency that arranged their contract. Some people see these arrangements as selling babies, or exploiting poor women's bodies. But others, including many feminists, say women should be able to use their bodies as they please. There is no federal law on the subject, and state laws vary enormously. California, for example, where Timmons and Olson hired the surrogates who delivered their two daughters, is the center of the nation's surrogacy industry, thanks to a friendly state law. But most states don't have any surrogacy laws on the books. Some simply refuse to enforce surrogacy contracts. Others, including Virginia, don't allow surrogacy unless at least one of the intended parents has a genetic connection to the baby. NY and Washington allow only unpaid, or “altruistic” surrogacy, and Michigan has criminal penalties for all types. “We're not getting any closer to a national consensus on the subject,'' Naomi Cahn, a family law professor at the George Washington University Law School, told BuzzFeed News. “And it's not just a split between red states banning it and blue states supporting it. ” Despite the legal limbo, because of the rise of in vitro fertilization  —   now responsible for nearly 2% of US births  —   and the legalization of   marriage, demand is also rising for surrogates. And, partly to avoid legal snags, these women are generally “gestational surrogates,” meaning that they carry embryos that are not genetically related to them. According to the CDC, there were 3, 432 gestational surrogates in 2013, up from 727 in 1999. Timmons and Olson say they were not thinking much about adding to their family until their friends asked if they wanted their two leftover frozen embryos (only one of which survived). The California surrogacy agency that had helped the two men get their daughters was no longer in business. So they researched the various state laws and chose Wisconsin because it allowed   marriage and had a state Supreme Court ruling upholding surrogacy contracts where they are in the best interests of the child. The Wisconsin proceedings started smoothly. Their agency, Pink and Blue Surrogacy and Fertility of Waterloo, found them a surrogate. And before Jacob was born, Judge Sarah O'Brien, who was filling in to cover a vacancy on the county court, issued an interim order giving them parental rights, which would become permanent once the baby was born and had a birth certificate. Jacob was born Aug. 17, 2015, but by that time, the case had been transferred to Judge Troupis, who had recently been appointed to the court. He nixed Judge O'Brien's order, and appointed an independent lawyer to represent Jacob's interests in the proceedings. Although the case was in Dane County, the liberal stronghold that contains Madison, Judge Troupis appointed as the child's legal guardian Mark Knutson, a lawyer 70 miles away whose radio broadcast, The Word on The Law, aims to reconcile God's word with the law. Knutson, in turn, brought in another lawyer from his firm, Erik Krueger, who had worked with Liberty Counsel, a group that defends public officials like Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to   couples. Timmons and Olson were for the most part allowed to keep Jacob at their home in Virginia, although at one point, Timmons had to stay in Wisconsin with Jacob while Olson and the girls returned to Virginia for the start of the school year. Rather than following the first judge's lead, and formalizing the couple's parentage rights on Jacob's birth certificate, Knutson insisted on   legal proceedings. Instead of conducting informal interviews with Timmons, Olson, the surrogate, her husband, and officials from the surrogacy agency, Knutson required them all to testify at formal depositions. And while many surrogacy cases in Wisconsin do not involve an independent legal guardian, and those that do usually have fees of less than $1, 500, Knutson's bills topped $100, 000  —   to be paid by Timmons and Olson. In November, Knutson filed a   report to Judge Troupis, calling for more court oversight of surrogacy cases and arguing that   a gestational surrogacy contract made by two men with no genetic connection to the child would open the way to a dangerous expansion of the concept of parenthood. Such surrogacy contracts, his report said, broker pregnancy, commodify children, and meet the needs of wealthy intended parents at the expense of the children involved. And, he warned, they stretch the boundaries of parenthood beyond all recognition, almost to the point of creating a world, like the one in Plato's Republic, in which all children would be raised communally, with no special connection to their parents. “Plato's assertion that ‘no child should know its parent' once anathema to American jurisprudence, is not so different from paying for parental rights in this case,” Knutson wrote. In his March decision, Judge Troupis seemed to rely on many of Knutson's arguments. He terminated the surrogate's maternal rights and gave the Virginia men only temporary custody, technically leaving Jacob an orphan. Knutson declined to comment for BuzzFeed News, and Judge Troupis could not be reached through his law office. As news of the case spread, LGBT rights advocates were horrified. “This case is an indication of the work that's left to be done,'' said Emily   director of public policy at the Family Equality Council, an advocacy group that supported Timmons and Olson. “There's a sense in the gay community and among parents at large that now that we have marriage equality, all the issues are resolved, and   couples will be treated like everyone else, but that's not yet true. '' The Troupis decision left Timmons and Olson at a crossroads: They could continue to appeal in Wisconsin, or take a different route, pursuing an adoption in their home state of Virginia. While they weighed these options from their home in Virginia  —   while caring for Jacob and their young daughters  —   they had a lucky break: Judge Troupis resigned May 2, to try, unsuccessfully, for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Timmons and Olson had already moved to reopen and reconsider Judge Troupis's ruling, but with the judge's resignation, their case was transferred to yet another judge, Peter Anderson, who overturned Judge Troupis's “faulty'' opinion, which he criticized for using language that was “unduly harsh and kind of weird. '' Since their victory, Timmons and Olson have spent the summer fighting Knutson's huge legal bills, and going public with their story to try to prevent similar actions by rogue judges elsewhere. “Our biggest concern is that you had a judge ignoring the law, ignoring precedent, with intention to take Jacob away, or to torture us, based on his personal opinion,'' Timmons said. “We're using our voices to try to make sure this never happens to another family. ” 			Judge Troupis appointed as the child's legal guardian Mark Knutson, who in turn brought in another lawyer from his firm, Erik Krueger. An earlier version of this story swapped the two men's first names.			   ",False," Jay Timmons and Rick Olson, a married gay couple from Virginia, didn't think they'd have any trouble becoming the legal parents of the baby boy their surrogate, a Wisconsin woman, delivered for them last year.

They had chosen a Wisconsin surrogate specifically because the state's Supreme Court had upheld surrogacy, and other   couples had had smooth sailing there. And by just about any measure, the two intended fathers were prime parent material: They both had good jobs, they had been together for 25 years, and they were already raising two daughters from previous surrogacies. But their careful plans went awry the month before their son, Jacob, was born, when their effort to be named his legal parents landed before a conservative judge who saw surrogacy as a form of human trafficking. Over the next 11 months, the couple's bizarre legal battle cost more than $400, 000 and kept them in constant terror of losing their son. We didn't have one night's peace,'' Timmons, 54, a conservative Christian and president of the National Association of Manufacturers, told BuzzFeed News. We'd wake up absolutely panicked, around 2 in the morning, and talk about the fact that we didn't know what was going to happen.  The couple took out second and third mortgages to cover the legal fees, and Olson, 49, quit his job as a federal lobbyist for Capital One to manage the proceedings. Over the last couple of years, a handful of   surrogacy lawsuits have cropped up in U. S. courts. In California, a surrogate named Melissa Cook refused a man's wishes to abort one of the triplets she was carrying for him. And in a Pennsylvania, The View   Sherri Shepherd tried, unsuccessfully, to pull out of a contract with a pregnant surrogate after splitting up with her husband. But the Wisconsin case is likely unprecedented, legal experts say, in that the surrogate, her husband, and the intended parents were all happy with their arrangement. Only the judge was not. The case was a judicial hijacking, Melissa Brisman, a surrogacy lawyer in New Jersey, told BuzzFeed News. We're at a time when a lot of people are still very committed to the idea that family values means straight married couples who have sex are the only ones who should have babies.  In June the couple won the case, thanks in large part to the judge's abrupt resignation. Although the proceedings had played out in closed court, once it was over, supporters of Timmons and Olson provided copies of court transcripts, briefs, and filings to BuzzFeed News. And although the case is certainly an anomaly among the thousands of surrogacy arrangements made in the US every year, it underscores how, in certain areas of the country, surrogacy has become a flashpoint for cultural debates about   marriage, reproductive rights, and the booming fertility industry. Dane County Circuit Court Judge Jim Troupis, appointed by Gov Scott Walker last year, opened his March opinion with the statement, Human trafficking comes in many forms.  And although he went on to describe the two dads as a spectacular set of parents'' who would raise the child in a nurturing environment with unmatched financial resources,'' he made it clear that he was bothered by the fact that the couple had paid a woman to carry a baby who was not related to them. The fundamental fact remains that another couple has provided the child as a gift to the petitioners, and the child has no genetic relationship to the petitioners,'' Troupis wrote. In order to bring the child into world, the petitioners have paid a significant amount of money. Without those payments there would be no child. '' Surrogacy is unquestionably expensive: Even before they ran into trouble and began accruing bills from a dozen different lawyers, the Virginia men paid $35, 000 to their surrogate and another $12, 500 to the Wisconsin agency that arranged their contract. Some people see these arrangements as selling babies, or exploiting poor women's bodies. But others, including many feminists, say women should be able to use their bodies as they please. There is no federal law on the subject, and state laws vary enormously. California, for example, where Timmons and Olson hired the surrogates who delivered their two daughters, is the center of the nation's surrogacy industry, thanks to a friendly state law. But most states don't have any surrogacy laws on the books. Some simply refuse to enforce surrogacy contracts. Others, including Virginia, don't allow surrogacy unless at least one of the intended parents has a genetic connection to the baby. NY and Washington allow only unpaid, or altruistic surrogacy, and Michigan has criminal penalties for all types. We're not getting any closer to a national consensus on the subject,'' Naomi Cahn, a family law professor at the George Washington University Law School, told BuzzFeed News. And it's not just a split between red states banning it and blue states supporting it.  Despite the legal limbo, because of the rise of in vitro fertilization     now responsible for nearly 2% of US births     and the legalization of   marriage, demand is also rising for surrogates. And, partly to avoid legal snags, these women are generally gestational surrogates, meaning that they carry embryos that are not genetically related to them. According to the CDC, there were 3, 432 gestational surrogates in 2013, up from 727 in 1999. Timmons and Olson say they were not thinking much about adding to their family until their friends asked if they wanted their two leftover frozen embryos (only one of which survived). The California surrogacy agency that had helped the two men get their daughters was no longer in business. So they researched the various state laws and chose Wisconsin because it allowed   marriage and had a state Supreme Court ruling upholding surrogacy contracts where they are in the best interests of the child. The Wisconsin proceedings started smoothly. Their agency, Pink and Blue Surrogacy and Fertility of Waterloo, found them a surrogate. And before Jacob was born, Judge Sarah O'Brien, who was filling in to cover a vacancy on the county court, issued an interim order giving them parental rights, which would become permanent once the baby was born and had a birth certificate. Jacob was born Aug. 17, 2015, but by that time, the case had been transferred to Judge Troupis, who had recently been appointed to the court. He nixed Judge O'Brien's order, and appointed an independent lawyer to represent Jacob's interests in the proceedings. Although the case was in Dane County, the liberal stronghold that contains Madison, Judge Troupis appointed as the child's legal guardian Mark Knutson, a lawyer 70 miles away whose radio broadcast, The Word on The Law, aims to reconcile God's word with the law. Knutson, in turn, brought in another lawyer from his firm, Erik Krueger, who had worked with Liberty Counsel, a group that defends public officials like Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to   couples. Timmons and Olson were for the most part allowed to keep Jacob at their home in Virginia, although at one point, Timmons had to stay in Wisconsin with Jacob while Olson and the girls returned to Virginia for the start of the school year. Rather than following the first judge's lead, and formalizing the couple's parentage rights on Jacob's birth certificate, Knutson insisted on   legal proceedings. Instead of conducting informal interviews with Timmons, Olson, the surrogate, her husband, and officials from the surrogacy agency, Knutson required them all to testify at formal depositions. And while many surrogacy cases in Wisconsin do not involve an independent legal guardian, and those that do usually have fees of less than $1, 500, Knutson's bills topped $100, 000     to be paid by Timmons and Olson. In November, Knutson filed a   report to Judge Troupis, calling for more court oversight of surrogacy cases and arguing that   a gestational surrogacy contract made by two men with no genetic connection to the child would open the way to a dangerous expansion of the concept of parenthood. Such surrogacy contracts, his report said, broker pregnancy, commodify children, and meet the needs of wealthy intended parents at the expense of the children involved. And, he warned, they stretch the boundaries of parenthood beyond all recognition, almost to the point of creating a world, like the one in Plato's Republic, in which all children would be raised communally, with no special connection to their parents. Plato's assertion that no child should know its parent' once anathema to American jurisprudence, is not so different from paying for parental rights in this case, Knutson wrote. In his March decision, Judge Troupis seemed to rely on many of Knutson's arguments. He terminated the surrogate's maternal rights and gave the Virginia men only temporary custody, technically leaving Jacob an orphan. Knutson declined to comment for BuzzFeed News, and Judge Troupis could not be reached through his law office. As news of the case spread, LGBT rights advocates were horrified. This case is an indication of the work that's left to be done,'' said Emily   director of public policy at the Family Equality Council, an advocacy group that supported Timmons and Olson. There's a sense in the gay community and among parents at large that now that we have marriage equality, all the issues are resolved, and   couples will be treated like everyone else, but that's not yet true. '' The Troupis decision left Timmons and Olson at a crossroads: They could continue to appeal in Wisconsin, or take a different route, pursuing an adoption in their home state of Virginia. While they weighed these options from their home in Virginia     while caring for Jacob and their young daughters     they had a lucky break: Judge Troupis resigned May 2, to try, unsuccessfully, for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Timmons and Olson had already moved to reopen and reconsider Judge Troupis's ruling, but with the judge's resignation, their case was transferred to yet another judge, Peter Anderson, who overturned Judge Troupis's faulty'' opinion, which he criticized for using language that was unduly harsh and kind of weird. '' Since their victory, Timmons and Olson have spent the summer fighting Knutson's huge legal bills, and going public with their story to try to prevent similar actions by rogue judges elsewhere. Our biggest concern is that you had a judge ignoring the law, ignoring precedent, with intention to take Jacob away, or to torture us, based on his personal opinion,'' Timmons said. We're using our voices to try to make sure this never happens to another family.  			Judge Troupis appointed as the child's legal guardian Mark Knutson, who in turn brought in another lawyer from his firm, Erik Krueger. An earlier version of this story swapped the two men's first names.			   "
184,73621,110175, This Woman's IUD Was Stuck For Two Weeks Because Her Catholic Hospital Refused To Take It Out,Buzzfeed News,Azeen Ghorayshi,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/catholic-hospital-sued-over-iud
"," The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed two lawsuits against the Catholic Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago for refusing a bleeding woman critical medical care to remove her birth control device. The case is only the latest in a series of suits by the ACLU against Catholic hospital networks, which often deny reproductive care based on a set of religious rules that all of their doctors are required to follow. The rules, called the Ethical and Religious Directives, are set by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. In addition to banning abortions under most circumstances, even when the mother's life is in danger, the ERDs prohibit doctors from offering or discussing birth control options, certain prenatal tests, or sterilizations. “We're really concerned that the Directives are substituting the views of religious leaders for the needs of patients,” Jenna Prochaska, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Illinois, told BuzzFeed News. Mercy Hospital did not respond to requests for comment from BuzzFeed News. The woman at the center of the new suits,   old Melanie Jones, had fallen down on a wet bathroom floor, causing her copper intrauterine device (IUD) to get dislodged from her uterus. When she got to Mercy, she was in severe pain and bleeding heavily. According to the complaints, the doctor who saw her confirmed that the IUD was partially expelled and needed to be removed. On June 30 the ACLU filed two suits, one with the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights, and another with the Illinois Department of Human Rights. According to the complaints, the doctor refused to remove the device because Mercy's “Catholic initiative” prevented her from providing any care relating to the contraceptive device. Because the copper IUD is    —   and therefore is only used for pregnancy prevention and doesn't have secondary uses like easing cramping or heavy periods  —   the doctor said her “hands were tied,” the suit states. Jones was turned away and told to find a different hospital that offered secular care. “I walked away from the doctor's office feeling shocked and stigmatized,” Jones said in a statement released by the ACLU. “Hospitals and doctors' offices should be places for healing and not judgment. ” Jones then contacted her insurance provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, which began the process of switching her to another provider. It took two weeks before she had the IUD removed. Her new doctor told her that she may have suffered cervical or uterine lacerations and possibly an infection, so did not immediately replace the device. The policies at Catholic hospitals affect many people. One in six hospital beds in the US is part of a Catholic institution. In Illinois, that number is closer to one in three. “Depending on where you're at in the state, there could be women who are geographically prevented from seeing secular providers, or can only see Catholic health care providers because of their insurance providers,” Prochaska said. Catholic hospitals have been expanding since the 1990s, but have picked up significantly in the last 10 years as more small clinics merge with large Catholic networks. “The Affordable Care Act has really brought in this new dimension where there's a lot of incentive to collaborate,” said Lori Freedman, an assistant professor of medical sociology at the University of California San Francisco who studies religious restrictions on reproductive care. “While they were already growing and merging and attaching the Directives to new hospitals, now we're seeing them attaching the Directives to clinics and other smaller institutions. ” As part of her research, Freedman has anonymously interviewed dozens of doctors who work within Catholic hospitals to understand how they balance providing quality medical care while also operating under the ERDs. Some doctors, she found, see the ERDs as just another kind of red tape. “But some of the doctors saw the Directives as very offensive and very upsetting. The feeling of having your hands tied was very common,” she said. But in Jones's case, she added, the ERDs may not have actually tied the doctor's hands, as there is no explicit rule against removing a birth control device. So the doctor's decision may have come from a general fear around ERDs, she said, rather than an edict from the bishops. “There's so many points in which the Directives have to be interpreted in practice,” she said. “I haven't heard a story like this before. ” In the last four years, the ACLU has filed at least nine lawsuits against Catholic hospital networks for denying women reproductive care. In 2011, a pregnant woman named Tamesha Means had her water break at 18 weeks. After she was rushed to her local Catholic hospital in Michigan, doctors refused to complete the standard procedure in such cases, which would have included terminating the pregnancy to protect the mother's life. Instead, they sent her home with painkillers. The next day, Means miscarried. The ACLU tried to sue the US Conference of Catholic Bishops on Means's behalf, but the suit was dismissed this June because the judge claimed he could not rule on church doctrine. He suggested that Means file an ordinary malpractice claim. (The decision is currently under appeal.) In Jones's case, like several others the ACLU has filed in the last few years, the organization has avoided the bishops and taken a different legal strategy: arguing that these hospitals are discriminating against female patients based on their sex. “Because Melanie is a woman who is trying to prevent pregnancy, she was told they would not care for her,” Prochaska said. “They could have provided the care, but they refused to for that reason  —   and they told her it was for that reason. ”  ",False," The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed two lawsuits against the Catholic Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago for refusing a bleeding woman critical medical care to remove her birth control device.

185,73622,110176, Doctors Are Upset About A Huge Change In Organ Donation Rules,Buzzfeed News,Nidhi Subbaraman,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160901012027/https://www.buzzfeed.com/nidhisubbaraman/liver-transplant-list-change
"," About 7, 000 Americans every year receive a liver transplant  —   and with it, a new lease on life. But another 1, 500 on the waitlist die before they are matched with a donor. Now the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) the agency that decides which patients receive donor organs, is planning to change the way livers are distributed across the country. The current rule, which says that livers go to patients relatively close to where the donor died, has come under fire because it means that the chances of getting an organ can depend more on where you live than how sick you are. The new rule, if approved, would instead allow regions with a high proportion of organ donors, relative to their local waiting list, to send livers to regions with a lower proportion of donors  —   even if that means a   plane ride. The architects of the new model estimate that transportation costs could grow from $269 million per year to $345 million, and that an average transplant would cost $4, 700 more, but argue that the overall spending on transplant care would fall as more people became healthy faster. UNOS declined to comment on the cost, but said the method could save 52 additional lives every year. It would be the biggest revision to liver allocation rules since 2002. But transplant surgeons are in uproar over the proposal, which was released for public comment earlier this month. Critics say the new scheme will be expensive to implement and the logistics of   transport will nullify any small benefits for patients. Some question the very principle of redistributing available organs, and say it would be better to focus on recruiting more donors. “There's a relatively wide split in the liver community,” James Trotter, medical director of liver transplants at Baylor Scott  White Health, who opposes UNOS's proposal, told BuzzFeed News. “My personal belief is that it won't have a substantive impact on improving overall outcomes in liver transplant candidates. ” Organs are costly to transport over long distances and livers are only viable for up to 12 hours. So UNOS's allocation policy so far has favored local transfers within 11 designated “districts” in the continental US. Once a liver becomes available in a given district, a transplant recipient is chosen based on their “MELD” score  —   an aggregation of factors that indicates how likely they are to die in the next three months. The higher the score, the closer the patient is to death  —   or to the next liver that becomes available in their district. But this system creates a problem. “You do have to get much sicker in one part of the country than another to get a liver,” Ryutaro Hirose, professor in clinical surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, who chairs the UNOS Liver and Intestine Committee, told BuzzFeed News. Take Louisiana, for example, which has a relatively large pool of available organs compared with other states. Half the transplants performed there are on people with scores under 30  —   patients who are sick, but may be able to work from home, for example. But in southern California, most transplant recipients are in the ICU. “If we could instantaneously transport a liver from one area of the country to the other with a magical transporter, that would be the most fair system  —   but we don't have that and that's not practical,” Hirose said. The committee's new proposal, he said, sought to create something that would most closely resemble a single national list. UNOS's new system would erase some district borders, to create eight regions instead of 11. As a result, areas with more donors would supply zones in which there are more patients with higher MELD scores. (A similar geographic disparity happens with other types of organ donations. This spring, UNOS's Thoracic Committee suggested allowing sicker heart patients to qualify for donor hearts from farther away. That proposal also incited fierce debate.) Hirose said that depending on the public response to the new plan, the committee could consider another revision, and another session of public comment, before the proposal is put into effect. But critics like Trotter expect that the proposal will pass despite the laundry list of objections, among them the contention that the mathematics underlying the   relied on limited data. “My biggest worry is that this is not really going to change the problem  —   it's a little bit of a BandAid,” Daniela Ladner, associate professor of surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, told BuzzFeed News. Ladner and her colleague Sanjay Mehrotra, a professor of engineering at Northwestern, have built an alternative distribution plan, one that they argue will save 85 lives every year  —   33 more than the UNOS's proposal promises. Also, the proposal that UNOS backs will not adapt easily to changing factors  —   such as more donors one year and fewer the next. They say UNOS is rushing to implement a suboptimal system while ignoring a potentially more effective solution. The Northwestern model, which is currently under review at a   journal, favors   distribution of organs that would allow transplant center and offices that already have relationships with their neighbors to draw on those ties. Instead of drawing hard borders, the Northwestern model would optimize matches across the entire country based on severity of illness and the distance to the donor liver. The UNOS proposal, for example, divides Tennessee in half, forcing offices in each side of the state to work with partners who are farther away. Mehrotra and Trotter point to this example as proof that the benefits of the model will not be worth the ensuing chaos. Another criticism is that the UNOS Committee did not invite the academic community or industry experts to propose alternative distribution models. Rather, the group settled on a new scheme first, then asked the transplant community for comment. Private shipping companies, for example, may have had good solutions, Trotter said. “What if you went to Federal Express and said, ‘How would you solve this problem? You're a    company whose entire business is focused on moving products around in the most rapid and efficient manner possible  —   what do you think? '”Richard Gilroy, medical director of liver transplantation at Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City, Utah, is among those who oppose the idea of moving organs  . Gilroy has studied donor trends in the US and was part of the UNOS Liver Committee until earlier this year, but does not support the new proposal. A more effective, less chaotic, and potentially less costly solution, he said, could be to just recruit more donors in regions that are struggling with waiting lists. For example, Philadelphia has among the highest rates of organ donation in the country, whereas NY has nearly the lowest. “That difference shouldn't exist over 94 miles,” he said, and is likely due to differences in the way the two cities handle donor recruitment. This is not the first time transplant surgeons have spoken up. At a meeting last year, where UNOS presented the current proposal, a majority of the audience  —   surgeons and transplant professionals  —   opposed it in an informal vote. “After that it was like, why don't you burn it and start from scratch?” Timothy Schmitt, director of transplants at the University of Kansas Hospital, who opposed the motion then, told BuzzFeed News. If the new rule goes into effect, he expects the University of Kansas Hospital will perform fewer transplants over the next five years. In response, doctors are likely to simply inflate their patients' MELD scores to compensate. With the new proposal, he said, “we'd have more complexity, more costs, and more death. ” 			James Trotter is the medical director of liver transplants at Baylor Scott  White Health, not Baylor Health Care System.

Rather, the group settled on a new scheme first, then asked the transplant community for comment. Private shipping companies, for example, may have had good solutions, Trotter said. What if you went to Federal Express and said, How would you solve this problem? You're a    company whose entire business is focused on moving products around in the most rapid and efficient manner possible     what do you think? 'Richard Gilroy, medical director of liver transplantation at Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City, Utah, is among those who oppose the idea of moving organs  . Gilroy has studied donor trends in the US and was part of the UNOS Liver Committee until earlier this year, but does not support the new proposal. A more effective, less chaotic, and potentially less costly solution, he said, could be to just recruit more donors in regions that are struggling with waiting lists. For example, Philadelphia has among the highest rates of organ donation in the country, whereas NY has nearly the lowest. That difference shouldn't exist over 94 miles, he said, and is likely due to differences in the way the two cities handle donor recruitment. This is not the first time transplant surgeons have spoken up. At a meeting last year, where UNOS presented the current proposal, a majority of the audience     surgeons and transplant professionals     opposed it in an informal vote. After that it was like, why don't you burn it and start from scratch? Timothy Schmitt, director of transplants at the University of Kansas Hospital, who opposed the motion then, told BuzzFeed News. If the new rule goes into effect, he expects the University of Kansas Hospital will perform fewer transplants over the next five years. In response, doctors are likely to simply inflate their patients' MELD scores to compensate. With the new proposal, he said, we'd have more complexity, more costs, and more death.

188,79792,120630,The Menace of Air Conditioning,National Review,Varad Mehta,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439581/air-conditioning-ban-puritan-sumptuary-laws
","Something strange has happened to air conditioning of late. It has become one of America's chief sources of hot air. For the last decade, each summer as temperatures rise, so does a tempest of dismay at Americans' affection for artificially cooled air. The latest gust of disapproval was vented by the Washington Post's Karen Heller, the title of whose rambling, incoherent column against Willis Carrier's gift captured well the attitude of a small but vociferous cabal: “I don't need air conditioning, and neither do you. ” Heller offers various reasons for her dislike, some serious (lower electric bills) some not (it ruins film noir). None, however, is her real motivation. For underneath it all lurks a strong suspicion that air conditioning is somehow wrong, unnatural an affront to an order of things that does not exist but could and should  —   and would but for AC. Heller isn't explicit, but her meaning is clear enough: Without air conditioning, life would be better. There are two ways to get people to give up goods society doesn't want them to have: making them more expensive and banning them. The records of both can charitably be described as mixed. Nevertheless, the Left has been clear that it is open to both approaches to reduce the presence of these “bads. ” The Left does have historical precedent on its side. For most of history, luxury items were subject not only to moral and social but also legal sanction. For most. But not all, and there's the rub. For the Left's solution to the perceived ills of air conditioning etc. is to revive sumptuary laws  —   a solution that, to be viable, requires turning the consumption of luxury goods back into a social problem, something it hasn't been considered for 250 years. A History LessonThe moral stigma that once attached to the idea of luxury has been effaced from the West's cultural memory. (Look at some advertising if you don't believe me.) Yet until recently, most societies regulated the purchase of luxury goods. They did so via sumptuary laws, as laws restricting personal expenditure are known. Sumptuary laws don't outlaw the sale of certain goods rather, they outlaw their purchase by certain people. The goods that can't be purchased are “luxuries,” and the people who aren't allowed to buy them are the poor. Sumptuary laws, write the scholars Maxine Berg and Elizabeth Eger, “confine the consumption of specific commodities to the elites,” thus “enforc[ing] rigid status structures. ” Different societies defined luxury differently, but whatever it was, they all thought it was something the poor shouldn't have. Mandeville aimed to provoke, and he succeeded. His book became one of the most notorious of the century. Yet he also succeeded in provoking a revolution in the social standing of luxury, a success perhaps best exemplified by a people that experienced a different kind of revolution. In 1780, Samuel Adams hoped the USA would be a “Christian Sparta. ” Seven years later John Stevens Jr. writing as “Americanus,” would have none of it: “Away with this Spartan virtue and black broth we'll have none of them. ” The stigma against luxury went with them. Two centuries later our body politic remains immune to it. Every so often, however, someone is tempted to test its resistance in the hope that it has worn down. The lifestyle cops are the latest to try. They don't frame their case against air conditioning and the rest in terms of luxury they can't, thanks to Mandeville and his successors. Yet even if the word luxury were nowhere to be seen (in fact, it is not entirely absent) substantively they are identical. The present antagonism toward air conditioning, cars, meat, and having children is animated by assumptions similar to those that inspired the traditional hostility to luxury. What the historian Henry C. Clark says of “luxury” in the 18th century is no less true of air conditioning (etc.) today. Both presented ideal vehicles for “rethinking the boundaries between private morality, social obligation and public interest. ” Now as then, guardians stand ready to patrol those boundaries. Which is to say that once again the rich have arrogated to themselves the duty of telling the poor what they may and may not have. Some Like It HotKaren Heller's screed was but the latest entry in a genre that has become as much a summer staple as   movies  —   the cri de compresseur. From William Saletan's 2006 critique of “the deluded world of air conditioning” to Kate Murphy's 2015 lament of the “deep freeze” offices experience every summer, the genre shares a belief that air conditioning is wasteful, indulgent, misguided, and even immoral. In 2012, two participants in a NY Times forum prompted by a Times report that AC use was exploding in the Third World answered the question “Should   go global, or be rationed away?” in terms that could have been borrowed from an     tract. Stan Cox advocated limiting air conditioning (“a luxury we can't afford”) on the grounds that we must distinguish “between absolute necessities like food or water and manufactured necessities like a houseful of refrigerated air. And making such decisions could help us recover some of the resilience our own culture has lost in the age of  . ” Rajendra Shende, former head of the U. N.'s ozone program, said air conditioning, iPads, fatty foods, and cars are not “rights” but “are luxuries, and they often make us soft. ” Literally soft, perhaps, as some investigators have found a link between air conditioning and obesity. Luxury makes society soft. Air conditioning is a luxury. QED. Mandeville must have been spinning in his grave. Of all the contributions to the literature, perhaps none is more characteristic than Leon Neyfakh's 2013 portrait of the idyllic life Americans might enjoy if we “decided we could no longer afford our addiction” to AC. People would wake up earlier, take naps in the afternoon, and “ride bikes and scooters everywhere. ” “Porch culture,” with its “  card games and flowing iced tea,” would make a comeback. They'd even sleep on their porches, as they did in the good ol' days. Some of the accommodations that would be necessary to get by with less air conditioning (  attire at work) can be effected with little difficulty. But others are not as feasible. “We can also build houses to offer extra protection against the heat,” avers Neyfakh, “using principles ignored by most modern architects. ” That's fine for someone building a new house, but what about those who aren't? And where would residents of urban   find porches to sip iced tea and sleep at night on? (There is at least a modest tension between the Left's disdain for air conditioning and its valorization of cities, which are generally hotter than their environs.) Like many critics of AC, Neyfakh proceeds from the conviction that it deprives us of a better world. Without it, he concludes, “we might discover we've been missing out on a way of life that actually feels quite natural. ” Neyfakh exemplifies the attitude of those who, according to Daniel Engber, their most percipient critic, have “come to see the air conditioner as a   for everything that's wrong with the country and the world. ” “The case against cooling,” he wrote in 2012, “stands on a foundation of   ideas and intuitions” about global warming, health, “moral laxity, and some ambiguous notion of what it means to live in harmony with the natural world. And running through them all is the strange and puritanical politics of human comfort. ” Like most puritanism, this version too is hypocritical. Indoor heating is just as artificial as air conditioning and expends as many resources, but no one is clamoring for the abolition of central heating. This double standard infuriates Engber. Heating has made the transition from luxury to necessity. The comfort police, however, refuse entry to AC. Neyfakh concedes that in limited circumstances it is necessary, but like Heller he believes that for the most part we can get by without it. If that's so, it's not really necessary. What is not necessary is superfluous, and what is superfluous can be dispensed with. Except air conditioning is a necessity in the modern world. Many of our most crucial systems would not function without it, not least the servers that make the Internet possible. There is also the small matter that lack of air conditioning literally sickens and kills people: by the hundreds and the thousands. If something that prevents people from dying is a necessity, then   would seem to fit the bill. Europeans remain unconvinced. The argument is an even harder sell to those who scorn air conditioning as a symbol of American extravagance and decadence. Returning to the fray last year, Engber again castigated the selective outrage that condemns AC but excuses heating, calling it “provincialism in the guise of  . To inveigh against the air conditioner is to claim that someone else's discomfort isn't worth the same as yours. It pretends that feeling hot and feeling cold are in different moral categories. ” The principle that goods and consumers occupied different moral categories is what once justified sumptuary legislation. Engber's indignation against this “naked ideology and posture” is entirely appropriate. What irks him most is how facile the stance against AC is. It endures without any factual support for a simple reason: It has become a way for “cosmopolitans to claim their bona fides, and to place themselves in opposition to irresponsible, American excess. ” For all the hot air it generates, on the scale of social malfeasance, air conditioning remains a minor nuisance. When it comes to supposed excess, nothing provokes the consumption cops like Americans' diets. Here they are much more open about their desire to impose sumptuary laws (though never by that name) to curtail availability of two foods they want to see much less of on Americans' tables: meat and sugar. Share article on FacebookshareTweet  Let Them Drink WaterThe news that in 2015 U. S. meat consumption rose at the highest rate in four decades was greeted with   and consternation on the left. ThinkProgress grieved that “America Cannot Kick Its Meat Addiction. ” Vox, mouthpiece of   censoriousness, was more verbose but equally  : “Americans should eat less meat, but they're eating more and more. ” There may be good reasons to alter how we consume meat, such as health and animal welfare. Yet the hectoring tone of many   diatribes leads to the suspicion that the goal is not moderation but elimination. What else is one to conclude when they sport titles like “Meat is horrible” and have URLs that declare “meat is destroying the planet”? Since many progressives take it for granted that the production and consumption of meat is an environmental calamity, exiling meat from our kitchens seems the only certain cure for the maladies it causes. Sharply reducing meat intake would reduce one's carbon footprint in half by adopting veganism, according to Vox's Brad Plumer. The consequences of not doing so are proclaimed by the minatory title of a 2015 New Republic story by Rebecca Leber: “This Is What Your Hot Dog and Burger Are Doing to the Planet. ” They are, in so many words, killing it. Or, rather, you are. So stop being a planet murderer, Leber admonishes us, and eat a veggie burger instead. The   campaign savors of a moral panic. And where one finds a moral panic, efforts to impose behavioral modification, whether voluntary or otherwise, can't be far behind. Two English academics, Caroline Wood and Wayne Martindale, contend that citizens of wealthy countries must “reduce their meat consumption and embrace other sources of protein. ” As there are numerous alternative sources of protein (Wood and Martindale stump for pulses) meat cannot be considered a necessity. And what is not a necessity is a luxury. Wood and Martindale say so flatly: “Meat is a luxury item. ” (Perhaps surprisingly, Mandeville agreed. He thought meat was one luxury everyone should go without, as he believed killing another creature for food was immoral.) If you can't ban a luxury, you tax it. A few proposals to tax meat have been floated, but they have not gotten much traction in the USA. There is also doubt about their efficacy. Which is just as well, given concerns that vegan diets can be harmful to children. Meat won't be treated like tobacco anytime soon. Sugar, however, is already heading down that path, and the food police won't be satisfied until it experiences the same ostracism from polite society. Progressives, paternalists, and other assorted busybodies have been pushing for a “soda tax” on   beverages for years. As Nanny Bloomberg could tell you, except in Berkeley, all attempts to implement such a tax went down in flames. Until, that is, this past spring, when Philadelphia became the first major city to pass one. When it was still being debated, Philadelphia's proposed soda tax became an issue in the Democratic presidential race. While Clinton backed it, Bernie Sanders opposed it on what seemed to be impeccably progressive grounds. It was, he said, a “regressive grocery tax that would disproportionately affect   and   Americans. ” For once, the Vermont senator found himself to the right of a cleavage on the left, as many progressives believe such a tax affirms rather than violates progressive values. Writing in Mother Jones, Anna Lappé depicted soda taxes as an eminently progressive idea whose revenues can be used to fund an array of progressive initiatives. The funding for new and expanded programs more than justifies the tax, as does the goal of reducing sugar consumption. If it falls disproportionately on the poor, so what? “It's not like this tax is for something people have to buy,” sniffed Lappé. Whatever they're drinking in Berkeley, it's not soda. Progressives were euphoric at news of a study showing that Berkeley's tax apparently put a significant dent in soda consumption. The fact that none blanched at the likelihood that the results would “confirm that a soda tax will encourage   consumers to choose different beverages” shows that progressives are willing to tolerate taxes that hit the poor if they facilitate progressive goals. As one researcher told Vox, “the big picture is that, thus far, particularly among   populations, the   beverage taxes do work  —   they do reduce consumption of sugary beverages. ” The results of the Berkeley study were released only a few days after the news that Americans were eating more meat. If the Berkeley findings are replicated in Philadelphia, don't be surprised if progressives start pushing for a meat tax. Such a tax would impact the poor most. But we've just seen that progressives have little compunction about squeezing the poor's pocketbooks. Indeed, that seems to be the point. There's an old adage that holds that if you want less of something, tax it. Progressives want less meat and sugar in our diets, and they're willing to tax them out of it. The cost will always hit the poor first and most: The less they can afford, the less they'll buy. It's for their own good, after all. For not the first time, progressives have become evangels of temperance. No doubt they would scoff at the comparison. Not without reason: Abstemiousness and   are hardly virtues one associates with the Left. Yet   is what it preaches when it comes to meat and sugar. Taxing alcohol because demon rum encourages ungodliness and undermines the moral fabric of society is something no   progressive would now support. But taxing   drinks to strike a blow against “Big Soda” and its baleful effects on society's health is something no   progressive can now oppose. A constitutional amendment against Mountain Dew is not on the horizon if progressives get their way, it won't be necessary. Carless WhisperFor all their agitation about Americans' consumption habits, nothing wounds the pride of our   Catos like Americans' continued refusal to give up their cars. Earlier this year a   writer, Edward Humes, decried the “absurd primacy of the automobile in American life. ” Enumerating a litany of harms it purportedly causes, from wasting money and fuel to the havoc it yearly wreaks on life and limb, he pronounced that “in almost every way imaginable, the car, as it is deployed and used today, is insane. ” A reflexive recourse to cars may be legitimately questioned, but the continual befuddlement expressed at Americans' unyielding embrace of   transport often reeks of condescension. The hoi polloi simply refuse to heed their superiors' wisdom, a refusal often couched as ignorance and denial. Why do Americans keep driving? Because, for one thing, low gas taxes relieve them of the burden of bearing the true “social cost” of their cars. Eric Jaffe's sketch of a world in which gas prices are more representative of “the true cost of driving” bears a striking resemblance to Karen Heller and Leon Neyfakh's   utopia: Fewer loved ones killed in car crashes. Healthier pregnancies and babies. More time spent with family and friends. Better access to jobs, and perhaps as productivity increased, higher wages. More livable developments and, with them, slimmer waistlines. Cleaner and quieter air. The sorts of things we can't fit in our purses or wallets, but which cost us dearly just the same. Progressives have a name for this utopia: Europe. One common charge leveled at our infatuation with cars is that the Interstate highway system ruined America's cities. Curiously, though, just as “we're finally getting sick of cars ruining our cities,” many writers with urbanist inclinations have begun arguing that cars may well be their salvation. Hence the recent profusion of articles extolling the virtues of autonomous cars and their potential benefits for cities. In one scenario, “taxibots” will “transform cities in extraordinary ways” by allowing city planners to   urban infrastructure to be more adaptive to shifting needs.   cars could be great for cities, but only if the social and political will exists to transform how Americans use cars. That transformation, unsurprisingly, ends with Americans' giving up their own cars. In one version of this future, by 2030 all cars on the road are  . Eliminating private car ownership is a requirement for the “heaven” prophesied by urban futurists to be realized. In this “alternative universe” where traditional cars are retired, the space once devoted to roads could be reclaimed for “trees, bike lanes, sidewalks, play spaces, bike parking, café expansion, community gardens, or even swimming pools. ” Yes, we would have to surrender our cars (and our autonomy, as not only cars but trips themselves would have to be shared) but the price would be worth it. Progressives, it turns out, love cars  —   as long as no one is driving them. The problem with this vision is its very  . All these articles talk about how great driverless cars will be for cities, as though somehow people will stop living in Idaho, Wyoming, and Nebraska, or the rural parts of states along the   corridor. Most people, when they think of a city, imagine one like NY, all density and skyscrapers. But many of America's   large cities (such as Phoenix, Austin, and Charlotte) have a decidedly suburban character.

Yet our cities, increasingly   are less a promise than a warning of what happens when children are regarded as a luxury. A city with no children is a harbinger not of a better future but of none at all. Children are the ultimate luxury. In many ways, they are the costliest good someone can have. Any luxury good may be subject to sumptuary laws, yet to treat another human being this way, even on the pretext of a supposed duty to prevent environmental cataclysm, is to violate a principle that exists on an altogether more fundamental level of moral obligation: the principle that no human being shall be treated merely as a means to an end. Is the future itself a luxury? For the sumptuarians, especially those motivated by environmental concerns, the answer is almost assuredly yes. But Rieder (and those of like mind) would perhaps counter that it's not that we can no longer afford the future, but that the future can no longer afford us. Once more, luxury finds itself at the treacherous crossroads where private morality, social obligation, and public interest come together. Luxury for Me, but Not for TheeThroughout history, one generation's luxury has been the next generation's necessity. What is novel about the goods discussed in this essay is that in their case, some advocates hope to reverse the process and turn this generation's necessities into the next one's luxuries. (Nor are the more ambitious likely to rest content restricting only these.) Some find that a laudable goal. Personally, I can't help but think that a world without children and road trips would be a poorer world than the one it succeeded. Even today, few of humanity's greatest advances would meet Mandeville's definition. Are antibiotics a luxury? Humanity survived for eons without them. But who now would give them up because they are not strictly necessary? What about broadband Internet? The federal government certainly thinks it's a necessity, as it is subsidizing access for the poor, thus sparing them from suffering the same deprivation all mankind did until 20 years ago. Examples could be adduced indefinitely. By now it should be clear that there are no definitions of luxury or necessity that can definitively describe even a single commodity, for even a single commodity will meet both definitions depending on who is applying them. And who is most likely not to have air conditioning, or to bear the brunt of consumption taxes? The poor. If an affluent,   white woman telling someone he doesn't need air conditioning isn't white privilege, there's no such thing. We don't think of it that way, so thoroughly has the matter been scoured from the Western imagination, but what one scholar termed the “  of luxury” is a cornerstone of modernity. The demise of sumptuary laws and the prejudice against luxury was a great victory for human liberty. The resurrection of either would be profoundly, deplorably retrograde. The rich have complained about how the poor spend money for as long as there has been money. For most of history, this was an illiberal posture. Now it seems to be gaining currency on the left. Sumptuary laws are oppressive. They exist solely to reinforce social hierarchies that is, to keep the haves up and the   down. They were already reactionary in the 18th century. They would be even more so today.,",False,"Something strange has happened to air conditioning of late. It has become one of America's chief sources of hot air. For the last decade, each summer as temperatures rise, so does a tempest of dismay at Americans' affection for artificially cooled air. The latest gust of disapproval was vented by the Washington Post's Karen Heller, the title of whose rambling, incoherent column against Willis Carrier's gift captured well the attitude of a small but vociferous cabal: I don't need air conditioning, and neither do you.  Heller offers various reasons for her dislike, some serious (lower electric bills) some not (it ruins film noir). None, however, is her real motivation. For underneath it all lurks a strong suspicion that air conditioning is somehow wrong, unnatural an affront to an order of things that does not exist but could and should     and would but for AC. Heller isn't explicit, but her meaning is clear enough: Without air conditioning, life would be better. There are two ways to get people to give up goods society doesn't want them to have: making them more expensive and banning them. The records of both can charitably be described as mixed. Nevertheless, the Left has been clear that it is open to both approaches to reduce the presence of these bads.  The Left does have historical precedent on its side. For most of history, luxury items were subject not only to moral and social but also legal sanction. For most. But not all, and there's the rub. For the Left's solution to the perceived ills of air conditioning etc. is to revive sumptuary laws     a solution that, to be viable, requires turning the consumption of luxury goods back into a social problem, something it hasn't been considered for 250 years. A History LessonThe moral stigma that once attached to the idea of luxury has been effaced from the West's cultural memory. (Look at some advertising if you don't believe me.) Yet until recently, most societies regulated the purchase of luxury goods. They did so via sumptuary laws, as laws restricting personal expenditure are known. Sumptuary laws don't outlaw the sale of certain goods rather, they outlaw their purchase by certain people. The goods that can't be purchased are luxuries, and the people who aren't allowed to buy them are the poor. Sumptuary laws, write the scholars Maxine Berg and Elizabeth Eger, confine the consumption of specific commodities to the elites, thus enforc[ing] rigid status structures.  Different societies defined luxury differently, but whatever it was, they all thought it was something the poor shouldn't have. Mandeville aimed to provoke, and he succeeded. His book became one of the most notorious of the century. Yet he also succeeded in provoking a revolution in the social standing of luxury, a success perhaps best exemplified by a people that experienced a different kind of revolution. In 1780, Samuel Adams hoped the USA would be a Christian Sparta.  Seven years later John Stevens Jr. writing as Americanus, would have none of it: Away with this Spartan virtue and black broth we'll have none of them.  The stigma against luxury went with them. Two centuries later our body politic remains immune to it. Every so often, however, someone is tempted to test its resistance in the hope that it has worn down. The lifestyle cops are the latest to try. They don't frame their case against air conditioning and the rest in terms of luxury they can't, thanks to Mandeville and his successors. Yet even if the word luxury were nowhere to be seen (in fact, it is not entirely absent) substantively they are identical. The present antagonism toward air conditioning, cars, meat, and having children is animated by assumptions similar to those that inspired the traditional hostility to luxury. What the historian Henry C. Clark says of luxury in the 18th century is no less true of air conditioning (etc.) today. Both presented ideal vehicles for rethinking the boundaries between private morality, social obligation and public interest.  Now as then, guardians stand ready to patrol those boundaries. Which is to say that once again the rich have arrogated to themselves the duty of telling the poor what they may and may not have. Some Like It HotKaren Heller's screed was but the latest entry in a genre that has become as much a summer staple as   movies     the cri de compresseur. From William Saletan's 2006 critique of the deluded world of air conditioning to Kate Murphy's 2015 lament of the deep freeze offices experience every summer, the genre shares a belief that air conditioning is wasteful, indulgent, misguided, and even immoral. In 2012, two participants in a NY Times forum prompted by a Times report that AC use was exploding in the Third World answered the question Should   go global, or be rationed away? in terms that could have been borrowed from an     tract. Stan Cox advocated limiting air conditioning (a luxury we can't afford) on the grounds that we must distinguish between absolute necessities like food or water and manufactured necessities like a houseful of refrigerated air. And making such decisions could help us recover some of the resilience our own culture has lost in the age of  .  Rajendra Shende, former head of the U. N.'s ozone program, said air conditioning, iPads, fatty foods, and cars are not rights but are luxuries, and they often make us soft.  Literally soft, perhaps, as some investigators have found a link between air conditioning and obesity. Luxury makes society soft. Air conditioning is a luxury. QED. Mandeville must have been spinning in his grave. Of all the contributions to the literature, perhaps none is more characteristic than Leon Neyfakh's 2013 portrait of the idyllic life Americans might enjoy if we decided we could no longer afford our addiction to AC. People would wake up earlier, take naps in the afternoon, and ride bikes and scooters everywhere.  Porch culture, with its   card games and flowing iced tea, would make a comeback. They'd even sleep on their porches, as they did in the good ol' days. Some of the accommodations that would be necessary to get by with less air conditioning (  attire at work) can be effected with little difficulty. But others are not as feasible. We can also build houses to offer extra protection against the heat, avers Neyfakh, using principles ignored by most modern architects.  That's fine for someone building a new house, but what about those who aren't? And where would residents of urban   find porches to sip iced tea and sleep at night on? (There is at least a modest tension between the Left's disdain for air conditioning and its valorization of cities, which are generally hotter than their environs.) Like many critics of AC, Neyfakh proceeds from the conviction that it deprives us of a better world. Without it, he concludes, we might discover we've been missing out on a way of life that actually feels quite natural.  Neyfakh exemplifies the attitude of those who, according to Daniel Engber, their most percipient critic, have come to see the air conditioner as a   for everything that's wrong with the country and the world.  The case against cooling, he wrote in 2012, stands on a foundation of   ideas and intuitions about global warming, health, moral laxity, and some ambiguous notion of what it means to live in harmony with the natural world. And running through them all is the strange and puritanical politics of human comfort.  Like most puritanism, this version too is hypocritical. Indoor heating is just as artificial as air conditioning and expends as many resources, but no one is clamoring for the abolition of central heating. This double standard infuriates Engber. Heating has made the transition from luxury to necessity. The comfort police, however, refuse entry to AC. Neyfakh concedes that in limited circumstances it is necessary, but like Heller he believes that for the most part we can get by without it. If that's so, it's not really necessary. What is not necessary is superfluous, and what is superfluous can be dispensed with. Except air conditioning is a necessity in the modern world. Many of our most crucial systems would not function without it, not least the servers that make the Internet possible. There is also the small matter that lack of air conditioning literally sickens and kills people: by the hundreds and the thousands. If something that prevents people from dying is a necessity, then   would seem to fit the bill. Europeans remain unconvinced. The argument is an even harder sell to those who scorn air conditioning as a symbol of American extravagance and decadence. Returning to the fray last year, Engber again castigated the selective outrage that condemns AC but excuses heating, calling it provincialism in the guise of  . To inveigh against the air conditioner is to claim that someone else's discomfort isn't worth the same as yours. It pretends that feeling hot and feeling cold are in different moral categories.  The principle that goods and consumers occupied different moral categories is what once justified sumptuary legislation. Engber's indignation against this naked ideology and posture is entirely appropriate. What irks him most is how facile the stance against AC is. It endures without any factual support for a simple reason: It has become a way for cosmopolitans to claim their bona fides, and to place themselves in opposition to irresponsible, American excess.  For all the hot air it generates, on the scale of social malfeasance, air conditioning remains a minor nuisance. When it comes to supposed excess, nothing provokes the consumption cops like Americans' diets. Here they are much more open about their desire to impose sumptuary laws (though never by that name) to curtail availability of two foods they want to see much less of on Americans' tables: meat and sugar. Share article on FacebookshareTweet  Let Them Drink WaterThe news that in 2015 U. S. meat consumption rose at the highest rate in four decades was greeted with   and consternation on the left. ThinkProgress grieved that America Cannot Kick Its Meat Addiction.  Vox, mouthpiece of   censoriousness, was more verbose but equally  : Americans should eat less meat, but they're eating more and more.  There may be good reasons to alter how we consume meat, such as health and animal welfare. Yet the hectoring tone of many   diatribes leads to the suspicion that the goal is not moderation but elimination. What else is one to conclude when they sport titles like Meat is horrible and have URLs that declare meat is destroying the planet? Since many progressives take it for granted that the production and consumption of meat is an environmental calamity, exiling meat from our kitchens seems the only certain cure for the maladies it causes. Sharply reducing meat intake would reduce one's carbon footprint in half by adopting veganism, according to Vox's Brad Plumer. The consequences of not doing so are proclaimed by the minatory title of a 2015 New Republic story by Rebecca Leber: This Is What Your Hot Dog and Burger Are Doing to the Planet.  They are, in so many words, killing it. Or, rather, you are. So stop being a planet murderer, Leber admonishes us, and eat a veggie burger instead. The   campaign savors of a moral panic. And where one finds a moral panic, efforts to impose behavioral modification, whether voluntary or otherwise, can't be far behind. Two English academics, Caroline Wood and Wayne Martindale, contend that citizens of wealthy countries must reduce their meat consumption and embrace other sources of protein.  As there are numerous alternative sources of protein (Wood and Martindale stump for pulses) meat cannot be considered a necessity. And what is not a necessity is a luxury. Wood and Martindale say so flatly: Meat is a luxury item.  (Perhaps surprisingly, Mandeville agreed. He thought meat was one luxury everyone should go without, as he believed killing another creature for food was immoral.) If you can't ban a luxury, you tax it. A few proposals to tax meat have been floated, but they have not gotten much traction in the USA. There is also doubt about their efficacy. Which is just as well, given concerns that vegan diets can be harmful to children. Meat won't be treated like tobacco anytime soon. Sugar, however, is already heading down that path, and the food police won't be satisfied until it experiences the same ostracism from polite society. Progressives, paternalists, and other assorted busybodies have been pushing for a soda tax on   beverages for years. As Nanny Bloomberg could tell you, except in Berkeley, all attempts to implement such a tax went down in flames. Until, that is, this past spring, when Philadelphia became the first major city to pass one. When it was still being debated, Philadelphia's proposed soda tax became an issue in the Democratic presidential race. While Clinton backed it, Bernie Sanders opposed it on what seemed to be impeccably progressive grounds. It was, he said, a regressive grocery tax that would disproportionately affect   and   Americans.  For once, the Vermont senator found himself to the right of a cleavage on the left, as many progressives believe such a tax affirms rather than violates progressive values. Writing in Mother Jones, Anna Lapp depicted soda taxes as an eminently progressive idea whose revenues can be used to fund an array of progressive initiatives. The funding for new and expanded programs more than justifies the tax, as does the goal of reducing sugar consumption. If it falls disproportionately on the poor, so what? It's not like this tax is for something people have to buy, sniffed Lapp. Whatever they're drinking in Berkeley, it's not soda. Progressives were euphoric at news of a study showing that Berkeley's tax apparently put a significant dent in soda consumption. The fact that none blanched at the likelihood that the results would confirm that a soda tax will encourage   consumers to choose different beverages shows that progressives are willing to tolerate taxes that hit the poor if they facilitate progressive goals. As one researcher told Vox, the big picture is that, thus far, particularly among   populations, the   beverage taxes do work     they do reduce consumption of sugary beverages.  The results of the Berkeley study were released only a few days after the news that Americans were eating more meat. If the Berkeley findings are replicated in Philadelphia, don't be surprised if progressives start pushing for a meat tax. Such a tax would impact the poor most. But we've just seen that progressives have little compunction about squeezing the poor's pocketbooks. Indeed, that seems to be the point. There's an old adage that holds that if you want less of something, tax it. Progressives want less meat and sugar in our diets, and they're willing to tax them out of it. The cost will always hit the poor first and most: The less they can afford, the less they'll buy. It's for their own good, after all. For not the first time, progressives have become evangels of temperance. No doubt they would scoff at the comparison. Not without reason: Abstemiousness and   are hardly virtues one associates with the Left. Yet   is what it preaches when it comes to meat and sugar. Taxing alcohol because demon rum encourages ungodliness and undermines the moral fabric of society is something no   progressive would now support. But taxing   drinks to strike a blow against Big Soda and its baleful effects on society's health is something no   progressive can now oppose. A constitutional amendment against Mountain Dew is not on the horizon if progressives get their way, it won't be necessary. Carless WhisperFor all their agitation about Americans' consumption habits, nothing wounds the pride of our   Catos like Americans' continued refusal to give up their cars. Earlier this year a   writer, Edward Humes, decried the absurd primacy of the automobile in American life.  Enumerating a litany of harms it purportedly causes, from wasting money and fuel to the havoc it yearly wreaks on life and limb, he pronounced that in almost every way imaginable, the car, as it is deployed and used today, is insane.  A reflexive recourse to cars may be legitimately questioned, but the continual befuddlement expressed at Americans' unyielding embrace of   transport often reeks of condescension. The hoi polloi simply refuse to heed their superiors' wisdom, a refusal often couched as ignorance and denial. Why do Americans keep driving? Because, for one thing, low gas taxes relieve them of the burden of bearing the true social cost of their cars. Eric Jaffe's sketch of a world in which gas prices are more representative of the true cost of driving bears a striking resemblance to Karen Heller and Leon Neyfakh's   utopia: Fewer loved ones killed in car crashes. Healthier pregnancies and babies. More time spent with family and friends. Better access to jobs, and perhaps as productivity increased, higher wages. More livable developments and, with them, slimmer waistlines. Cleaner and quieter air. The sorts of things we can't fit in our purses or wallets, but which cost us dearly just the same. Progressives have a name for this utopia: Europe. One common charge leveled at our infatuation with cars is that the Interstate highway system ruined America's cities. Curiously, though, just as we're finally getting sick of cars ruining our cities, many writers with urbanist inclinations have begun arguing that cars may well be their salvation. Hence the recent profusion of articles extolling the virtues of autonomous cars and their potential benefits for cities. In one scenario, taxibots will transform cities in extraordinary ways by allowing city planners to   urban infrastructure to be more adaptive to shifting needs.   cars could be great for cities, but only if the social and political will exists to transform how Americans use cars. That transformation, unsurprisingly, ends with Americans' giving up their own cars. In one version of this future, by 2030 all cars on the road are  . Eliminating private car ownership is a requirement for the heaven prophesied by urban futurists to be realized. In this alternative universe where traditional cars are retired, the space once devoted to roads could be reclaimed for trees, bike lanes, sidewalks, play spaces, bike parking, caf expansion, community gardens, or even swimming pools.  Yes, we would have to surrender our cars (and our autonomy, as not only cars but trips themselves would have to be shared) but the price would be worth it. Progressives, it turns out, love cars     as long as no one is driving them. The problem with this vision is its very  . All these articles talk about how great driverless cars will be for cities, as though somehow people will stop living in Idaho, Wyoming, and Nebraska, or the rural parts of states along the   corridor. Most people, when they think of a city, imagine one like NY, all density and skyscrapers. But many of America's   large cities (such as Phoenix, Austin, and Charlotte) have a decidedly suburban character. This poses a potentially fatal challenge to the vision of an urban revolution propelled by the adoption of   vehicles, for it is possible that instead of dampening Americans' enthusiasm for sprawl, SDVs, thanks to the efficiencies they introduce, will accelerate it. As the Wall Street Journal's Christopher Mims put it: It is a kind of wishful thinking, an act of technological determinism, to think that   cars will override Americans' longstanding preference for wide open spaces.  That our glorious   future may not belong to cities but instead prolong progressives' suburban nightmare would be a delicious irony. Delicious like a Big Mac, Coke, and fries. (One imagines, should they become the norm, a new genre of dystopian thriller in which it is a crime to reprogram your   car to drive to a speakeasy McDonald's.) However autonomous vehicles play out, cars in one form or another would remain a necessity. But personal ownership could well become a luxury. And we know what happens to luxuries.

189,79793,120631,Trump's Immigration Speech Made Good Sense Sound Like Extremism,National Review,David French,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439610/donald-trump-immigration-speech-smart-message-bad-delivery-wrong-messenger
","Last night, Trump outlined the core of a sensible, responsible immigration policy . . . and then promptly obscured that policy in an avalanche of    rhetoric, inane flourishes, and extravagant promises. He threw raw steaks at an audience hungry for red meat, and in so doing squandered a chance to persuade. Let's break this down into the basics. At its core, Trump's   plan turns on a few simple and sound concepts: It is the responsibility of the American president to secure the liberty and prosperity of the American people for the sake of national security, economic stability, and cultural cohesion, a nation must be able to control its borders and regulate who enters the country and those who enter the country must be people who will contribute to the health and vitality of the national community. Moreover, when speaking of the wave of refugees streaming from jihadist conflict zones in the Middle East, Trump rightly attacked the misconception that the “humane” response is to open our borders to migrants despite knowing that our jihadist enemy is attempting to infiltrate their ranks. In the aftermath of the Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein seemed poised to slaughter the Kurds, the USA established functional safe zones that allowed our Kurdish allies to survive and even thrive in place. We can and should do the same for Middle Eastern refugees today. Unfortunately, Trump's immigration views, even if sensibly expressed, are outside the mainstream of American public opinion. That wasn't a problem in the Republican primary, where he appealed to a plurality that was apparently longing for a celebrity voice to confront the establishment on immigration (and virtually everything else). But it's a problem now. A big problem. (We can't just “supervise” the safe zones, we have to create them, and that means a greater,   more dangerous commitment in the Middle East. Who's the globalist now?) The man takes a sound idea  —   for example,   the Cold War practice of ensuring that immigrants don't “advocate or publish ‘the economic, international, and governmental doctrines'” of the precise ideology we're fighting  —   and turns it into an “ideological certification” that exactly no one (outside his circle of true believers) trusts him to create, much less to enforce fairly and legally. And he does it all with a tone that causes those who feel genuine and justifiable compassion for illegal immigrants peacefully working and raising families in this country to recoil at his obvious disdain. He does not communicate in the language of a leader making hard choices after balancing all the competing interests, but rather in the language of a man who's punishing people he doesn't like. There is a powerful and, yes, compassionate argument for an immigration policy that is built around border security and domestic law enforcement. A president's greatest priority is his citizens, and when there is powerful evidence that current immigration policy is harming the economic   and security of American families, there is an obligation to act.

","Earlier this month, Senator Mike Lee (R. Utah) and I sent a letter to StateSecretary John Kerry, Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew, and Attorney General Loretta Lynch on the subject of the Obama administration's $400 million cash payment to the Islamic Republic of Iran, which occurred on January 16, 2016  —   the day the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action officially went into effect, and the day four Americans unjustly detained by the Iranian regime were finally released. As the State Department has now admitted, this money was “leverage”  —   in other words, a ransom  —   to secure the release of those four Americans from the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. It is appalling that this administration paid a ransom to Iran. Our hostages should have been released unconditionally as a sign of good faith before, not after, any negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. Agreeing to this ransom sets a terrible precedent that if the Iranian regime wants more American cash, all they have to do is scoop up more of our citizens  —   as the Iranians have already begun to do. But as irresponsible and dangerous as the ransom payment was, it is not the only problem. The American people also need to know whether the payment violated U. S. sanctions on Iran for its worldwide support of terrorism. These sanctions remain in effect despite the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which, the administration has assured us, deals only with Iran's nuclear program. The federal regulations that implement the   sanctions generally prohibit transferring money to Iran, even if the money is converted into foreign currencies and routed through other countries, as was the case here. A private citizen, in other words, could go to prison for what the administration did. The knowledge that a series of payments totaling $1. 31 billion followed the $400 million cash payment only raises more questions  —   suggesting, as it does, that the administration is differentiating between the $400 million, which is the amount the government of the Shah of Iran paid in the original arms deal, and the $1. 3 billion, which is the interest the Islamic Republic claims on that money and would have to come from American taxpayers. Did the administration wire $1. 31 billion from the Judgment Fund to Iran? If so, then why did the administration make the $400 million payment in cash? Why did it convert the cash to foreign currency? And why did it ship the cash in an unmarked cargo plane? If the payment was legal, presumably the administration would have just transferred the money. These extraordinary measures suggest they were simply trying to avoid detection. None of this adds up, and we need to know if the Obama administration was trying to cover up criminal conduct. While Congress should draw attention to the administration's    scheme, the bottom line must not only be whether the Obama administration paid a ransom (it did) but whether the various payments to Iran were legal in the first place. If the Obama administration continues to refuse to answer the questions that will let Congress get to the bottom of these highly unusual transactions, Congress will have no choice but to compel the answers it needs.

","Rachel Dolezal, the white lady who got busted pretending to be a black lady, has somehow managed to get herself invited to be a feature at a rally for natural black hair.

Well, according to The Daily Beast, Brantley invited Dolezal simply because she had seen pictures of some of Dolezal's   work on television (yes, Rachel Dolezal now works braiding hair) and actually didn't know anything about Dolezal's history when she invited her. “I couldn't believe it,” Brantley told The Daily Beast in a phone interview. “People threatened to boycott me. ” “They are calling me a sellout and saying that I am ‘Massa's girl' or some mess like that,” she continued. “I just stopped looking and blocked everybody. ” The craziest thing of all, however, is that Brantley  —   despite now knowing everything about Dolezal's past  —   said she is still going to feature Dolezal at her rally. Dolezal, by the way, told The Daily Beast that she just doesn't understand why there's all this hubbub about her appearance. “It's a justice issue and I've been a social justice activist for years,” she said. “It's really that simple. ” More Race   Percent of Black Boys in California Fail State Reading StandardsUnsayable Truths about a Failing High SchoolBlack and Muslim Women Are Invisible to the Feminist MovementNo, though. It's really not. Why? Because you're not just a “social justice activist,” you're a “social justice activist” who made your career as a “social justice activist” by pretending to be black. You were even, as The Daily Beast recalls, suspected of sending a package full of racial threats to your own mailbox at the NAACP  —   a mailbox to which only USPS workers (who have since been cleared) and you had the key. So, no, it's really not just “that simple. ” Your past as a fake black person really does complicate things when it comes to you being featured in a prominent position at a “natural” blackness event. Now, this kind of behavior from Dolezal isn't all that surprising. After all, we're talking about a lady who, when asked if she was black, responded with, “I don't understand the question. ” But what is surprising is that people are continuing to fall for her garbage  —   even after it's been proven that “garbage” is exactly what it is.

You were even, as The Daily Beast recalls, suspected of sending a package full of racial threats to your own mailbox at the NAACP     a mailbox to which only USPS workers (who have since been cleared) and you had the key. So, no, it's really not just that simple.  Your past as a fake black person really does complicate things when it comes to you being featured in a prominent position at a natural blackness event. Now, this kind of behavior from Dolezal isn't all that surprising. After all, we're talking about a lady who, when asked if she was black, responded with, I don't understand the question.  But what is surprising is that people are continuing to fall for her garbage     even after it's been proven that garbage is exactly what it is. I mean, how does she do it? Really, it's almost impressive. Or, it would be . . . if only it weren't so sick.,"

","Twenty years ago last week, Congress passed legislation overhauling the nation's cash welfare system. In a new paper, “Poverty after Welfare Reform,” I attempt to discern how hardship has changed among children since August 22, 1996, when President Clinton signed into law the legislation that created the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program. The report argues that, contrary to the claims of an influential book by Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer, practically no children live in families getting by on $2 a day per person. It concludes that “deep child poverty”  —   living under half the official poverty line  —   is probably no higher than it was before welfare reform. The study argues that both $   and deep poverty are measured very badly, making it difficult to draw conclusions from them about hardship trends. In contrast, child poverty (deep or shallow) unambiguously fell after 1996 and is lower than ever before. The paper is descriptive by design. Rather than making the claim that welfare reform caused child poverty to fall, I simply argue that it did fall (or was more or less unchanged among the poorest of the poor). However, I do believe that welfare reform actually reduced child poverty. This case is poorly understood by the critics of reform, who tend to distort it in predictable ways. Here I want to begin to lay out why conservatives believe that welfare reform benefited poor children, by clarifying what we do and don't mean by that. In a second piece, I will get to the facts that have convinced me that welfare reform reduced poverty. Well, sure, if you set up the debate to be about whether welfare reform was the only factor behind declining poverty or suggest that its goal was to completely eliminate poverty, that's a debate you have a pretty good chance of winning. I'll gladly agree with Weissmann that “TANF may have had some positive effects on the headline poverty rate, but it didn't   work miracles. ” If you think your opponent is arguing for miracles, it is likely that you are misinterpreting their claims. Other critics of reform seem to believe that claiming that welfare reform was beneficial amounts to saying that it achieved the single largest reduction of child poverty possible. Now that would be some achievement  —   successfully enacting the one set of policy details (and getting the Department of Health and Human Services to implement the one set of rules and regulations) that minimized child poverty to the largest extent possible. That's a pretty high bar, though, isn't it? The real question of interest is not whether welfare reform was the only cause of declining child poverty, nor whether it was the best conceivable way to reduce child poverty. The important question is whether welfare reform reduced child poverty or not  —   are children better off today than they would be if we had not passed welfare reform? That is a difficult question to answer because none of us knows what the counterfactual would have been in the absence of reform. It would be silly for me to claim to have an airtight case. Nor does anyone who argues that welfare reform did more harm than good. But critics of reform should at least recognize the case as it actually exists rather than parrying an argument that no one is making. For example, Weissmann uses his critique as an opportunity to troll me by suggesting (falsely) that what I conclude is that   and Medicaid expansions prevented welfare reform's actual damage from being realized. That suggestion betrays a real lack of imagination about what would have happened absent welfare reform (in addition to misreading the evidence I present, but that's for the next essay). RELATED: Welfare Reform: Two Decades of Success, The old cash welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) was broadly unpopular because it violated   American values around reciprocity (expectations in return for help) and personal responsibility. Americans have historically been willing to help the poor, but only if they are willing to help themselves. AFDC discouraged work, marriage, savings, and independence. Any expansions to the safety net that occurred after 1996 took place in a context in which we had eliminated the old system in favor of one that was more consistent with widely shared values. To some extent, Americans (and legislators) became more generous after welfare reform because of welfare reform. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Under the old system, it is highly unlikely that Congress would have expanded the safety net as it did in response to the Great Recession, because most single mothers would have been able to rejoin the welfare rolls. Meanwhile, many fewer single mothers would have benefited from joining the workforce because under AFDC many would have remained on the rolls. (As I'll discuss in the next essay, rising employment was much more important for reducing poverty than Weissmann and other critics believe.) The technical way of stating this argument is that subsequent expansions of the safety net (like the increase in work among single mothers) were “endogenous”  —   we cannot assume they would have occurred absent welfare reform. It is also interesting to ask whether some other   policy would have reduced child poverty more than the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) did, regardless of whether or not that's what would have happened. But we don't know how any other   proposal would have affected child poverty. That some other theoretical plan might have done better is not a damaging criticism of PRWORA. RELATED: Ending Welfare as We Know It, Too many liberals are far too confident that the reforms they advocate would have been better than PRWORA and would be better than continuing current policy, because they tend to not seriously consider unintended consequences. Reforms that make receipt of welfare relatively more attractive will tend to draw more families onto the rolls and thereby run the risk of preventing them from benefiting from the advantages of employment. Or it will discourage planned and responsible childbearing by reducing its costs. Relatedly, many critics of reform are too dismissive of paternalistic   policy. “Don't people know what's best for themselves?” ask liberals and libertarians who assume that if work pays, people will naturally work. There is much to be said for this view, undoubtedly, but even if most people know what's best for them most of the time, some do not at least some of the time. Furthermore, policy shouldn't necessarily strive to give people what they think is best for themselves in a world where wants are potentially unlimited and someone else is paying. Some people value leisure more than work at the margin, and in that case we have to ask whether working taxpayers are obliged to support the leisure of those who could work but do what's best for themselves by not working. The same may be said of people whose childbearing decisions are what's best for them none of us is entitled to do what's best for ourselves and expect others to bear the costs. These particular ways of evaluating the success of welfare reforms are, in a sense, moral rather than economic. But conservatives hold these normative views, in part, out of the belief that work and responsible childbearing may benefit children economically even if they do not make parents happier in the short run. For that matter, they may make society better off economically in the long run by promoting economic growth. In the end, the conservative resistance to weakening the tough provisions in the 1996 law stems from the belief that  —   regardless of whether there might have been a better way  —   welfare reform improved the lives of the poor when compared with the old system. We get very nervous about departing from a model that a lot of evidence suggests was better than the status quo. Of what does that evidence consist?

","Fifteen years ago last month, President George W. Bush announced his policy on federal funding for    research, a policy that would shape the political conflict between the   movement and the scientific community for the rest of his administration. (For an overview of the debates that ensued, interested readers will enjoy this comprehensive report issued in 2012 by the Witherspoon Council on Ethics and the Integrity of Science.) Bush's plan for   research was an elegant compromise  —   he would permit the federal government to fund research on   lines (that is, cultures of embryonic stem cells that can be grown indefinitely and shipped to researchers around the world) that had already been derived from human embryos (21 lines in total) but he would not fund research on new   lines. This policy would allow the government to support the burgeoning field of   research without creating an incentive for scientists to destroy human embryos. An appropriations rider known as the   amendment has prohibited the federal government from funding research in which human embryos are created or destroyed, so government cannot fund the creation of embryonic stem cells, though research using those stem cells has been considered acceptable. Despite the overturning of Bush's policy, he has been vindicated to some extent by developments in   research. In 2006, a promising alternative to embryonic stem cells (  induced pluripotent stem cells, which are derived from adult skin cells and do not require the destruction of embryos) was developed, in part owing to vigorous support from the Bush administration. RELATED: Embryonic Stem Cell Hype  —   Was Hype, However, while the future is not as bleak as it might have been, the underlying moral problems raised by research on human embryonic stem cells remain unresolved. Although human cloning, for instance, became less vigorously pursued after the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells in 2006, American scientists in 2013 created embryonic stem cells by destroying human embryos for the first time their feat was replicated by other American scientists in 2014. Cloning to create stem cells (which is to say, creating cloned human embryos for the express purpose of destroying them) remains legal in much of the USA and, in California and NY, is even supported by   agencies. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Most of the   controversy in the first decade of this century concerned the source of stem cells, but advances in   research now mean that troubling uses of stem cells, regardless of whether they are derived from embryos or not, are now being proposed by scientists. Adding human stem cells to animal embryos to generate chimeras (lab animals that contain human cells, tissues, and organs) is an emerging area of research that the National Institutes of Health is now considering supporting. Scientists are also working on ways to manufacture human sex cells (sperm and egg cells) from stem cells, which could dramatically transform the nature of human reproduction. There are likewise a number of areas of embryo research that will continue to result in the destruction of large numbers of human embryos. Though there is little data available on the kinds of embryo research being conducted in the USA, in the United Kingdom only about one in four   research projects involve the creation of stem cells. Recent developments in   technology may soon allow doctors to modify human embryos to prevent genetic disease. This raises the   specter of “designer babies,” though in fact, for the foreseeable future, the genetic modification of human embryos is likely to be confined to research  —   meaning that scientists will genetically modify human embryos, but to prevent the birth of any “designer babies” they will scrupulously destroy any of the human embryos they experiment on. Perhaps more important than any form of embryo research, however, are the practices of the in vitro fertilization industry itself. Most   research uses embryos that are “left over” from IVF clinics. IVF doctors will create many more embryos than they transfer to the woman's uterus, freezing the rest for future attempts. If a pregnancy is established before all the embryos are transferred, the parents are faced with the decision of what to do with the remaining embryos. Some are donated to other couples trying to have a child, some are donated to researchers, many are discarded, and others are simply kept frozen as parents struggle with the decision. The availability of these frozen human beings is what makes most embryo research possible. (More rarely, scientists create embryos expressly for research, as they do when they attempt to create cloned human embryos.) Though the   debate was often posed as a conflict between the demands of science and the demands of ethics, scientists could argue that they were only asking to be held to the same ethical standards as are IVF doctors, who regularly kill human embryos with little justification. Dealing with the underlying moral problems raised by   research means reforming the way IVF is practiced  —   reducing the number of excess embryos that are created so that thousands of human embryos will not be left in freezers to be either discarded or experimented on by scientists. Such reforms will not be easy, but it is a political project that deserves more attention from the   community. Though there are still many ways in which the treatment of the unborn in the USA can be improved, we can at least be thankful that, because of wise decisions like Bush's   policy, the situation of the unborn is not deteriorating as quickly as it might otherwise have.",False,"Fifteen years ago last month, President George W.

(For an overview of the debates that ensued, interested readers will enjoy this comprehensive report issued in 2012 by the Witherspoon Council on Ethics and the Integrity of Science.) Bush's plan for   research was an elegant compromise     he would permit the federal government to fund research on   lines (that is, cultures of embryonic stem cells that can be grown indefinitely and shipped to researchers around the world) that had already been derived from human embryos (21 lines in total) but he would not fund research on new   lines. This policy would allow the government to support the burgeoning field of   research without creating an incentive for scientists to destroy human embryos. An appropriations rider known as the   amendment has prohibited the federal government from funding research in which human embryos are created or destroyed, so government cannot fund the creation of embryonic stem cells, though research using those stem cells has been considered acceptable. Despite the overturning of Bush's policy, he has been vindicated to some extent by developments in   research. In 2006, a promising alternative to embryonic stem cells (  induced pluripotent stem cells, which are derived from adult skin cells and do not require the destruction of embryos) was developed, in part owing to vigorous support from the Bush administration. RELATED: Embryonic Stem Cell Hype     Was Hype, However, while the future is not as bleak as it might have been, the underlying moral problems raised by research on human embryonic stem cells remain unresolved. Although human cloning, for instance, became less vigorously pursued after the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells in 2006, American scientists in 2013 created embryonic stem cells by destroying human embryos for the first time their feat was replicated by other American scientists in 2014. Cloning to create stem cells (which is to say, creating cloned human embryos for the express purpose of destroying them) remains legal in much of the USA and, in California and NY, is even supported by   agencies. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Most of the   controversy in the first decade of this century concerned the source of stem cells, but advances in   research now mean that troubling uses of stem cells, regardless of whether they are derived from embryos or not, are now being proposed by scientists. Adding human stem cells to animal embryos to generate chimeras (lab animals that contain human cells, tissues, and organs) is an emerging area of research that the National Institutes of Health is now considering supporting. Scientists are also working on ways to manufacture human sex cells (sperm and egg cells) from stem cells, which could dramatically transform the nature of human reproduction. There are likewise a number of areas of embryo research that will continue to result in the destruction of large numbers of human embryos. Though there is little data available on the kinds of embryo research being conducted in the USA, in the United Kingdom only about one in four   research projects involve the creation of stem cells. Recent developments in   technology may soon allow doctors to modify human embryos to prevent genetic disease. This raises the   specter of designer babies, though in fact, for the foreseeable future, the genetic modification of human embryos is likely to be confined to research     meaning that scientists will genetically modify human embryos, but to prevent the birth of any designer babies they will scrupulously destroy any of the human embryos they experiment on. Perhaps more important than any form of embryo research, however, are the practices of the in vitro fertilization industry itself. Most   research uses embryos that are left over from IVF clinics. IVF doctors will create many more embryos than they transfer to the woman's uterus, freezing the rest for future attempts. If a pregnancy is established before all the embryos are transferred, the parents are faced with the decision of what to do with the remaining embryos. Some are donated to other couples trying to have a child, some are donated to researchers, many are discarded, and others are simply kept frozen as parents struggle with the decision. The availability of these frozen human beings is what makes most embryo research possible. (More rarely, scientists create embryos expressly for research, as they do when they attempt to create cloned human embryos.) Though the   debate was often posed as a conflict between the demands of science and the demands of ethics, scientists could argue that they were only asking to be held to the same ethical standards as are IVF doctors, who regularly kill human embryos with little justification. Dealing with the underlying moral problems raised by   research means reforming the way IVF is practiced     reducing the number of excess embryos that are created so that thousands of human embryos will not be left in freezers to be either discarded or experimented on by scientists. Such reforms will not be easy, but it is a political project that deserves more attention from the   community. Though there are still many ways in which the treatment of the unborn in the USA can be improved, we can at least be thankful that, because of wise decisions like Bush's   policy, the situation of the unborn is not deteriorating as quickly as it might otherwise have."

","Brazil started a new chapter of its history this Wednesday, as the Senate voted to permanently remove socialist president Dilma Rousseff from office. And the Left lost more than that: It also no longer controls the narrative.   of the 81 senators supported the removal of Dilma, who had been suspended in May. Vice President Michel Temer, a centrist who succeeded to the presidency upon Rousseff's suspension, will stay in office until January 2019. The result surprised no one, since Dilma's approval rate had fallen below double digits in the last months. Were they right, it would have been the slowest and most peaceful coup ever. Not one shot was fired. There are no political prisoners. Dilma and her lawyers spent dozens of hours in Congress making the case for her absolution. She is still living in the presidential palace, and can stay there for 30 more days if she wants. The Supreme Court, in which 8 of the 11 judges were appointed by Dilma's Workers' Party, saw no reason to stop the proceedings. In fact, following the Brazilian constitution, the final phase of the trial in the Senate was presided over by the president of the Supreme Court, who was appointed by Dilma's mentor and predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. RELATED: Brazil Has Had Enough, The coup narrative, echoed by part of the Left in Europe and America (the list includes Bernie Sanders) is not new. What is new is that this kind of discourse, embodied by Dilma and her image as an old   guerrilla who fought the dictatorship in the 1970s to bring “democracy” to Brazil, doesn't work anymore. Dilma's impeachment is not a story of political persecution. The fragmented Brazilian Congress started the impeachment trial reluctantly, only after public demonstrations repeatedly brought millions of people into the streets. In São Paulo alone, 1. 4 million people protested for Dilma's removal on March 13. The whole impeachment trial took nine months and passed through one vote on the floor of the House and three votes on the floor of the Senate. In all of them, the required   majority was surpassed. So benevolent (and corporatist) were the senators that, right after removing Dilma Rousseff from office, they even found a way to soften the punishment and allow her to be eligible to hold public office again. Despite its periods of instability, Brazil's political history has a long tradition of accommodation, with both good and bad consequences. On the one hand, it has resulted in a high level of tolerance for corruption and inefficiency. On the other, it has avoided the bloodbaths and civil wars that affected many of its neighbors. Even in the 21 years of the military dictatorship, for example, the regime killed 424 people, including armed guerrillas in combat. In comparison, Chile's dictatorship executed 40, 000 people in 17 years. Argentina's left 30, 000 dead in eight years. Both countries have only a fraction of Brazil's huge population. The fact that Brazilians aren't inclined to sudden ruptures also means several corrupt politicians will take part in the new administration. What changes, then, with the impeachment? Many things. First, the “classic” corrupt politician who cares only about his Swiss bank account is still less harmful than the one that uses dirty money to subvert public institutions, as the Workers' Party tried to do. Second, the socialist agenda that attacked economic freedom and pushed for abortion on demand and radical LGBT policies will be stopped, at least for a while.

The $62 million Falcon 9 rocket blew up on its launchpad in Cape Canaveral, Fla. just after 9 a. m. during a test for a planned Saturday  . No one was reported injured in the blast, which occurred near NASA's Kennedy Space Center. But the epic fail sent Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg into a funk during his tour of Kenya, where he was touting his plan to use the     satellite to provide Internet service across   Africa. Facebook had planned to partner with the French satellite operator Eutelsat Communications for the project, part of the   Internet. org program. “I'm deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX's launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent,”  . “Fortunately, we have developed other technologies like Aquila that will connect people as well,” he added, referring to a   drone that Facebook plans to use to beam Internet access into remote areas. “We remain committed to our mission of connecting everyone, and we will keep working until everyone has the opportunities this satellite would have provided. ” The blast dealt a major blow to SpaceX, which was facing a backlog of more than $10 billion worth of launch orders after an accident last year. It's also a setback for NASA, which depended on the private company for missions to the International Space Station. Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who founded SpaceX in 2002 with the goal of slashing launch costs to make travel to Mars affordable, said the cause of the accident was not yet known. “Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation.

The destruction of the rocket and its payload could not have come at a worse time for Musk, who wants to merge automaker Tesla with energy company SolarCity, where he is chairman, amid a serious cash crunch. He lost about $390 million in shares as the stocks of two companies plummeted after the explosion, CNBC reported. Musk also faces a government probe of a fatal crash involving a Tesla Model S in Florida in which the driver used the vehicle's controversial Autopilot feature. SpaceX had been due to launch its 29th Falcon 9 early Saturday, carrying the satellite owned by Israel's Space Communication. The rocket exploded as operators were preparing to test fire its nine main engines, with the craft remaining on the pad, the Florida Today news site reported. Falcon 9s are used to ferry supplies to the International Space Station for NASA, so the blast represented a major setback for the agency's plans for cargo hauls and, ultimately, astronaut flights.

202,90410,135213,Letting terrorists off the hook for killing Americans,NY Post,Seth Lipsky,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://nypost.com/2016/09/01/letting-terrorists-off-the-hook-for-killing-americans/,"It looks like there's a new red line in the Middle East. It has been laid down by the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals, which just let the Palestinian Authority off the hook for killing Americans. It's a stunning decision that may be the beginning of the end of a   effort to use civil law to hold accountable those responsible for the murder of Americans abroad. What a bitter pill for surviving families who turned to the courts when our presidents refused to act. What fodder, too, for our presidential campaign, in which the kind of federal judges we want is one of the issues. The three judges who just ruled for the Palestinians were appointed by Bill Clinton and Obama. The case involves an effort by 11 American families who, after losing loved ones in terror attacks in Israel, sued the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority. They won big last year in federal district court in Brooklyn. This particular case involved several different attacks. The most famous of the group was the 2002 bombing of a cafeteria at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. That attack killed nine and wounded around 100 others. Five American students were among the dead. Not only did a jury find that the Palestinians had done the deeds but they awarded $218. 5 million in damages. Under the law, known as the   Act, the damages were automatically tripled, to $655. 5 million. The appeals judges threw all that out on the grounds that the district court never should have asserted its jurisdiction over the case in the first place. It instructed the lower court to dismiss the claims. It's not my purpose here to get into the fine points of federal law on which the judges ruled in this case. I've been warning for years of the disappointments that are going to accrue if we leave the war to civil court. That began in the 1990s, when a Brandeis coed from New Jersey, Alisa Flatow, was slain in Israel in a bus bombing backed by Iran. Her heroic father, Stephen Flatow, eventually won a legal judgment of $247 million. The Clinton administration actually fetched up in court to oppose Flatow's efforts to collect on the judgment. It feared that the court would upset diplomatic immunity. It bought out the Flatow claim for six cents on the dollar, yet now we're shipping billions to Iran. This latest case involves attacks by Palestinians against Americans and which the Palestinian Authority praised and the perpetrators of which it rewarded financially. Yet America has launched no military strikes against the Palestinian regime, or even against Hamas, which claimed credit for murdering the Americans. Instead, it hectors Israel against “disproportionate” responses to terror and tries to get it to be more forthcoming in negotiations. No wonder the families tried civil law. The   Act, under which they sought justice, provides that any American national injured by international terrorism  —   or his estate or heirs  —   can sue. When they won in lower court, though, Obama had his deputy secretary of state file a declaration in court warning against getting too tough. It's a classic example of the administration's thinking. Team Obama insisted that it supports “just compensation” for families of those the Palestinian terrorists killed or injured. It's just that the administration has “significant concerns” about the “harms that could arise. ” It was worried that the Palestinian Authority's ability to operate as a government might become “severely compromised. ” Even, it seems, if Congress didn't share that worry when it passed the   Act. How much, if at all, the administration's declaration swayed the appeals court is hard to gauge. In the end, the judges said that “no matter how horrendous” the attacks on the Americans, the lower court had gone beyond the limits allowed by the Constitution. So 14 years after the Americans were killed or injured, the survivors and their loved ones are out of luck. One of their lawyers, Kent Yalowitz, called it a “cruel decision,” noting that the very terrorists who prompted the   law have now avoided responsibility. The Palestinian Arabs are gloating. Reuters is quoting their regime's finance minister, Shukri Bishara, as calling the Second Circuit's decision “a big blow to anyone who attempts to blackmail us. ” “We have drawn a red line under it,” Bishara added, just to bring the matter full circle. It's an ironical turn of phrase, given how Obama and Clinton seem to feel about red lines.",False,"It looks like there's a new red line in the Middle East. It has been laid down by the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals, which just let the Palestinian Authority off the hook for killing Americans. It's a stunning decision that may be the beginning of the end of a   effort to use civil law to hold accountable those responsible for the murder of Americans abroad. What a bitter pill for surviving families who turned to the courts when our presidents refused to act. What fodder, too, for our presidential campaign, in which the kind of federal judges we want is one of the issues. The three judges who just ruled for the Palestinians were appointed by Bill Clinton and Obama. The case involves an effort by 11 American families who, after losing loved ones in terror attacks in Israel, sued the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority. They won big last year in federal district court in Brooklyn. This particular case involved several different attacks. The most famous of the group was the 2002 bombing of a cafeteria at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. That attack killed nine and wounded around 100 others. Five American students were among the dead. Not only did a jury find that the Palestinians had done the deeds but they awarded $218. 5 million in damages. Under the law, known as the   Act, the damages were automatically tripled, to $655. 5 million. The appeals judges threw all that out on the grounds that the district court never should have asserted its jurisdiction over the case in the first place. It instructed the lower court to dismiss the claims. It's not my purpose here to get into the fine points of federal law on which the judges ruled in this case.

The five city unions that help run the pension funds  —   including the United Federation of Teachers  —   signed off on the Stringer letter. “The EpiPen debacle appears to be the costly consequence of weak board oversight of management decisions that prioritize   profit at the expense of   value creation,” Stringer said in the   leader to Dougas Leech, chair of Mylan's nominating and governance committees.

If you're really resistant to trying it, that means you don't have a lot of flexibility mentally, emotionally and undoubtedly physically, explained Chrisler, and that won't work for being with a woman.

The billionaire investor's son, Brett Icahn, is angling for management responsibilities in order to stay on at his father's publicly traded firm, The Post has learned. In addition to overseeing a new pool of money, Brett, 37, wants some say at Icahn Enterprises before his    father is ready to retire. “Carl will be around another 20 years,” said Russell Glass, who was president of Icahn Associates before leaving to form RDG Capital Management. Brett and investment partner David Schechter, who manage the firm's Sargon portfolio, are advising the firm while they work to finalize the terms of a new deal, sources said. Their latest agreement expired on July 31. The partners are poised to get a huge payday come September, when each will collect a windfall of more than $250 million, thanks to lucrative investments in Apple and Netflix, among others. Icahn gave the partners $3 billion to manage in 2012, and agreed to give them an amount equal to 7. 5 percent of the profits over a 4 percent “hurdle” rate of return. The two have more than doubled the Sargon portfolio's value  —   to roughly $7 billion as of Dec. 31, 2015. Brett stood to reap $256 million as of that date, according to the firm's regulatory filings. Ditto for Schechter. Although the elder Icahn and his son declined to comment, they are making progress toward a new deal. “Brett and Carl are continuing to look at ideas and are also negotiating,” a source said. Neither is in a rush to invest, feeling the stock market is overheated. “Current market valuations do not provide an opportune time to embark on large new investments,” Brett and Schechter said in an August statement. The partners mulled starting their own hedge fund a couple of years ago but dropped the idea. As it stands, Brett has no stake in Icahn Enterprises, sources said. Neither Brett nor Schechter has a seat on the firm's   board. The president and chief executive of Icahn Enterprises, Keith Cozza, is 37 years old  —   the same age as Brett. Brett is older than his father was when the elder Icahn started his hedge fund. The     investor formed Icahn & Co. in 1968. RDG's Glass, who worked in an office next to Brett, believes the younger Icahn is ready for the top job. “He's probably got 30 years of work experience condensed in 15 years,” Glass said. “There was more scrutiny on him [than] anyone else at the firm. ” Brett is described by several people who have worked with him as more introverted than his    father. “They [Brett and Schechter] sit and read   all day long,” said a source.",False,"Carl Icahn may hand over some control to get his financially successful offspring to stick closer to home.

218,94804,140362,Inside the hospital room where TNT's Craig Sager bravely battles cancer,NY Post,Associated Press,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://nypost.com/2016/09/01/tnts-craig-sager-continues-to-battle-cancer-with-another-bone-marrow-transplant/,"HOUSTON  —   The chemotherapy has diminished Craig Sager's   chestnut hair to a few unruly strands, and on this day of hope, a simple green   and blue shorts adorn the man known by millions for his ostentatious wardrobe and easy rapport with the NBA's elite. He methodically extended a long, skinny arm to an IV pole holding the stem cells he is counting on to save his life. There was silence as he cradled the tube, watching the crimson liquid drip, drip, drip in a perfect cadence into the cannula feeding it into his   body. TNT's most beloved basketball broadcaster received a rare third bone marrow transplant on Wednesday as an aggressive form of leukemia continues to take its toll. The    Sager has battled acute myeloid leukemia since 2014, and announced in March that he was no longer in remission. Sager knows the odds are against him. Yet he is unfazed. “I like to gamble,” he told the Associated Press. “I like to bet on horses, I like to bet on dogs, I like to bet on a lot of things. I've bet on a lot of things with a lot higher odds than this. ” Two other times Sager has received a bone marrow transplant with stem cells, and in both instances it put him into remission for several months. His son, Craig Sager II, was the donor then. This time, the anonymous    donor was considered a perfect match. Sager has been hospitalized for a month and has another   stay ahead. He hasn't thought a lot about the random man whose bone marrow could change everything for him. But when he learned of his age, he expressed a possibly only   concern. “My only thing was I was afraid that when he signed up to be the donor, he may have been in some drunk fraternity house, trying to impress his date,” Sager said with a smile. “And they call him up the next day and say: ‘Want to come down to the hospital?' and he's like: ‘What? '” His fears turned out to be unfounded. “He came through,” Sager said. It is the latest of close to 100 procedures Sager has endured in his   fight and it was performed at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Sager began the transplant at about 11:30 a. m. Central time and it wasn't complete until more than 10 hours later. Dr. Muzaffar Qazilbash, Sager's stem cell transplantation physician, researched thousands of such transplants at MD Anderson over the last 15 years to illustrate just how uncommon Sager's procedure was. “It's less than 1 percent of the total number of transplants,” Qazilbash said. “It's very rare to have three transplants. ” Sager, who has worked for TNT for more than three decades, calls himself coachable and said he's open to trying anything doctors believe might help. “I've had every chemo in the alphabet, most of them more than once,” he said. “Some of them that aren't even in the alphabet, they're just numbers  —   clinical trials. But I bet if you added all those up, it would have to be like   or  . I've had 23 bone marrow aspirations. Having one isn't fun and I've had 23. So that's been tough. ” Despite the rigors of treatment and how they can ravage his body, he's never thought about giving up. In fact, he gets angry when he meets other patients who say they've grown weary of fighting. “Man, life is too beautiful, too wonderful, there's just too many things,” he said. “It's not just you. It's your family and kids and all. Fight. Fight until the end. Fight as hard as you can. ” With his radiant smile and   persona, it takes time to peel back the layers of positivity and catch a glimpse of how hard that fight can be. “His attitude is (that) nobody wants to hear it,” said Stacy Sager, his wife,   caregiver and No. 1 fan. “And so it makes you reflect on yourself and the things that you say when you're complaining about little things in life and trivial things and it just puts things in perspective. ” But there are times, often as night creeps into early morning, when it all becomes too much. No medication can help. ‘Fight. Fight until the end. Fight as hard as you can.' “I've never had any of those days where I've actually said ‘Why me,' or ‘I can't do it,'” he said. “But I'll have some dark nights where I'll be here by myself and maybe getting some medicine that's making me jump around like a rabbit. And I'm in pain and I've got chills and I've got fever and I've got everything mixed into one and I'm throwing up and have diarrhea   …     and I'll just say: ‘Stacy, I need you. I need you.' “And she'll come to me and just hold me and it just makes it better,” he said. A few days before his transplant, Stacy came down with a bad cold and doctors sent her home, fearful she'd transmit her illness to her husband. Hall of Famer and TNT colleague Charles Barkley heard she couldn't be there for a couple of days and hopped on a plane from Phoenix. The problem was that Sir Charles had hip replacement surgery less than a month ago and wasn't cleared to travel. He said his doctor was livid when he learned Barkley had defied orders and flown halfway across the country. Barkley informed the doctor that it was an emergency  —   though it was hard to know who was there for whom. “Craig Sager is one of the most interesting people I've ever met,” Barkley said. “We go to see Sager to cheer him up and by the time you leave you're like, ‘Is anything wrong with him?' He has the most positive attitude   …     when you go to try and cheer him up, his attitude is so upbeat he cheers you up. ” Sager has found inspiration in a little girl who lost her fight with cancer before her ninth birthday. He befriended Lacey Holsworth and her family while working on a story about her illness and remained friends with her parents after she died in April 2014. Holsworth had cheered on the Michigan State basketball team and  . Last weekend, her parents visited Sager in his Houston hospital room. They left him with a more tangible reminder of her bravery. “They brought me little Lacey's boots that she used to always wear to games and a picture of her wearing them,” Sager said, clutching the   cheetah footwear accessorized with laces made from silk ribbons. “That little girl was so amazing. Fought for all of those years, was always positive, always cheerful, always brought other people's spirits up. So if I'm laying here feeling bad, I just think about Lacey and it puts everything in perspective. ” Sager is also bolstered by his drive to be back on the sideline for the NBA season. He doesn't expect to have recovered from Wednesday's transplant in time for the season opener on Oct. 25, but aims to return by early November for more of the gentle sparring with the likes of Spurs coach Gregg Popovich . It would be a victory not just for him, but for all the people his fight has inspired. “It means that you're surviving and you're winning,” he said. “That you're knocking down obstacles and clearing hurdles that are put in front of you and you're doing them with flying colors. ” On Wednesday, five colorful balloons were tied to one side of his hospital bed. Several had birthday greetings and two said: “Happy birthday, it's your big day. ” Festive, yes. But Sager was born in June. “When you get stem cells, they say it's your new birthday,” Stacy explained. “So this is his fourth birthday. ” Sager tried to downplay the pageantry surrounding the event, saying it wasn't “a big deal. ” That earned a sweet, yet stern, admonishment from his beloved wife. “It is a big deal,” she said. “It's giving you life. ”",False,"HOUSTON     The chemotherapy has diminished Craig Sager's   chestnut hair to a few unruly strands, and on this day of hope, a simple green   and blue shorts adorn the man known by millions for his ostentatious wardrobe and easy rapport with the NBA's elite.

219,94906,140496,Neil Walker's shutdown misery: ‘Was hurting team and myself',NY Post,Zach Braziller,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://nypost.com/2016/09/01/neil-walkers-shutdown-misery-was-hurting-team-and-myself/,"Another one bites the dust. After receiving second and third opinions on the herniated disc in his lower back that was hitting a nerve, Neil Walker announced Thursday he will be undergoing   surgery, joining David Wright, Lucas Duda, Matt Harvey, Zack Wheeler and Juan Lagares as Mets likely out for the season. Walker said the operation, known as microdiscectomy surgery, will include a   recovery time and has a high success rate. Manager Terry Collins    —   hours after general manager Sandy Alderson told reporters Walker could play through the injury and described it as “routine”  —   and the team's second baseman made it official a day later before the Mets went for a   sweep over the Marlins at Citi Field. Walker last played in a game on Saturday. If he had continued to play through the pain, Walker estimated he would've been at 60 percent, and the condition was worsening, not improving. “It was a very difficult decision,” said Walker, a free    who expressed hope of a possible return with the Mets. “There were a lot of factors that involved: the way the team was playing, the way I felt. I did everything I could. Twice, I played a couple of days, tried to give myself a couple days off, and the biggest issue was it was hitting a nerve. I still can't feel my toe, and that's caused kind of a chain reaction. “The more I tried to push through it, the more I realized I was hurting the team and myself. I had to be honest with what was going on here. I want nothing more than to be on the field. It's very disappointing in my eyes. ” Walker was told by doctors playing through the injury would only make it worse. He had numbness in his toe, and after playing in a few games, his legs would get weak. He felt fine swinging, but sliding, diving and running would weaken his body. Walker was undecided about the surgery before meeting Wednesday with the third doctor. That doctor felt strongly he should go ahead with the surgery, instead of putting his future at risk, and further hurting his back and legs. Mets doctors hadn't been as forceful about him getting the procedure done immediately. The initial plan was for him to play through the injury, as Alderson and Collins had said in recent days after a recent MRI exam showed the herniated disc. But after meeting with all three doctors, it was clear to him surgery was the right move. “At this time of year, with the possibility of breaking up double plays, diving for balls, trying to score from first, I just didn't think it was the right thing for me to do, to do to the team,” Walker said. “Playing one day, taking a couple of days off, or playing two days in a row, taking a day off, as much as I was willing to do that, after taking to the doctors, they felt like that was not a good thing to do. ” Walker experienced a similar issue in 2012 with the Pirates, but didn't go through with surgery then, getting an epidural shot instead. He was 25 at the time, not 30, as he is now, another reason to go ahead with the procedure. Walker was enjoying a strong first season with the Mets after coming over from the Pirates in exchange for Jon Niese in an offseason trade. Replacing Daniel Murphy at second base, Walker was hitting . 282 with a   . 476 slugging percentage and . 823 OPS. He hit 23 home runs, equaling a career high. Collins plans to use Kelly Johnson and Wilmer Flores at second base in place of Walker. “‘Walk' gave it his best effort, but unfortunately we got to move on,” Collins said. “With [Asdrubal Cabrera] back, with [Yoenis Cespedes] back, and certainly with the way [Wilmer Flores] is swinging, there's a feeling of, ‘Hey, we're OK.'

It skirts the edge of absurdity, as anything like this must, but manages to keep clear, and it includes a big flourish in the manner of early films by M Night Shyamalan, which adroitly finesses the narrative issue of what exactly to do with a movie about aliens showing up on Earth. I have been agnostic about this kind of movie recently, after the overwrought disappointments of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar and Jeff Nichols's Midnight Special. But Villeneuve's Arrival is both heartfelt and very entertaining. As is now expected with this kind of film, the protagonist is a flustered, bewildered civilian with special expertise, brusquely pressed into service by the military, which has got the spacecraft surrounded in the short term. Amy Adams is Dr Louise Banks, a professor of comparative linguistics with nothing and no one in her life but her work. But as it happens, Dr Banks was once seconded as a military adviser to translate a video of insurgents speaking Farsi. So when a dozen giant spaceships land in 12 different locations on Earth (including Devon  —   sadly there no scenes there) each looking like a bisected rugby ball standing on end, a bunch of army guys led by Col Weber (Forest Whitaker) show up on Louise's doorstep, demanding she come with them to help translate what the aliens are saying. Why, you ask, did they not approach Noam Chomsky, with his understanding of “deep structure” in language? Perhaps Prof Chomsky did not care to help America's   complex. At any rate, Louise's liaison is the flirtatious Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) a military scientist who, in a stereotypical and fallacious way, equates his masculinity with science and affects to despise what he sees as the softer discipline of linguistics. Michael Stuhlbarg plays Halpern, the glowering CIA chief. But unbeknown to them, there is a secret tragedy in Louise's life: a lost child, dead of cancer in her late teens. Her attempts to communicate with the aliens cause painful but illuminating echoes in her mind. If a lion could speak, said Wittgenstein, we would not understand him. Does the same go for aliens? Spielberg solved this issue elegantly in Close Encounters of the Third Kind by making the form of communication a   musical phrase, ending questioningly on the dominant. Villeneuve's solution is more literal. The aliens have a code which  —   a little preposterously  —   Louise finds herself more or less able to crack, with the crowdsourced expertise of the other 11   teams around the globe. But it is her human intuition, vulnerability and spontaneity that finally enable her to reach out to the visitors.  Inevitably, these “contact” moments are where the film's real impact and atmosphere have to be. And Villeneuve doesn't disappoint in sequences of eerie and claustrophobic strangeness  —   though I concede the film is most effective before the physical form of the aliens is revealed. There are also touches of comedy: Ian and Louise decide, for convenience's sake, to nickname two aliens Abbott and Costello  —   maybe in homage to the linguistic misunderstanding in the duo's famous routine about a baseball team's positions. By coolly switching focus to political intrigue and betrayal within the human ranks, Villeneuve keeps a grip on his story and creates ballast for its departure into the realms of the visionary and supernatural. And he also prepares us for the film's sense that language itself, freed of our usual sense of its linear form, might be more important than anyone thought. (I wonder if Villeneuve has seen the 2010 documentary Into Eternity, by Danish   Michael Madsen, about attempts to devise a new universal language to label underground repositories of nuclear waste  —   labels whose warnings have to be understood by future humans whose language has evolved away from what we know now.)

Arrival is a big, risky, showy movie which jumps up on its   highwire and disdains a net. And yes, there are moments of silliness when it wobbles a little, but it provides you with spectacle and fervent romance."
227,103400,151832,'No amnesty': Trump vows to deport millions during 'first hour in office',Guardian,Rory Carroll,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech,"Trump has vowed anew to deport millions of undocumented people and to build a wall on the border with Mexico, defying expectations that he would soften his stance on immigration. The Republican presidential candidate doubled down on his hardline stance in a speech on Wednesday night which delighted core supporters and dismayed his few remaining Latino allies who had expected a tack towards moderation. Speaking hours after a lightning visit to Mexico, Trump told a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, he was sticking with his plan for a “deportation force” to intercept illegal border crossers and hunt down criminal “illegal aliens” already in the US. “We are going to take our country back,” he said, repeating a mantra from the primary campaign. Speaking largely from a teleprompter, he also reiterated his vow to make Mexico pay for a   wall which, he said, would bristle with sensors, towers and guards. “We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall, 100%. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it. ” Trailing Clinton in the polls with just 69 days to the election, Trump and campaign aides had recently fuelled expectations of a “softening” of immigration policy, prompting speculation about a  . Instead the speech, which his campaign billed as a major policy address, represented an abrupt reversion to an aggressive tone just hours after an unfamiliar conciliatory timbre in Mexico City, where Trump met President Enrique Peña Nieto. The Republicans nominee roused the crowd in Phoenix with grisly details about murders committed by undocumented immigrants. He brought on stage “angel moms” whose children were killed. He spoke of cancelling an Obama administration programme that gives work permits to about 800, 000 young immigrants who came to the US as children  —   a stance likely to slam shut any chance of Latino outreach. Anybody who entered the US illegally would be subject to deportation and there should be detainers for immigrants who committed any crime, not just felonies, he said. “There will be no amnesty. ” Trump also promised ideological tests for   visa applicants, a “sunset” on visa laws requiring Congress to rewrite them every few years and a ban on taxpayer funding for cities that don't deport undocumented immigrants. The rhetoric trampled over the hopes of Trump's dwindling band of conservative Latino supporters. “This is how I feel: disappointed and misled,” tweeted Alfonso Aguilar, head of Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles. Jacob Monty, a member of Trump's National Hispanic advisory council, resigned, Politico reported. The rightwing columnist Ann Coulter, in contrast, exulted. “Wow. This doesn't sound like “softening. ” GO, TRUMP! !!” she tweeted. Trump did however imply most of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants would remain untouched while his putative administration focused on deporting 2 million with alleged criminal records. “We will begin moving them out, day one. My first hour in office, those people are gone. ” The ambiguity over the fate of   undocumented immigrants marked a tacit retreat from Trump's earlier vows to swiftly deport all 11 million people. The lack of clarity allowed supporters and critics to fill in the blanks with their own wishes and anxieties. Trump's policy could in theory yet resemble that of Obama, who has deported millions, and Republicans rivals such as Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, whom Trump accused of supporting de facto amnesty. The speech capped a whirlwind day of political theatre in which Trump, after a year of denigrating Mexican immigrants as rapists, murderers and drug dealers, met President Peña Nieto in Mexico City, triggering a backlash from Mexicans who denounced the NY businessman as a tyrant, and worse. Trump emerged from the private meeting at Los Pinos, the presidential residence, heaping praise on Mexican immigrants. “They are amazing people, amazing people . .. Mexicans are just beyond reproach. Spectacular, spectacular and hardworking people. ” He said the   meeting with Peña Nieto was “substantive” and “excellent” but did not touch on his pledge to force Mexico to pay for the wall. “We're saving that discussion for a later date. ” Mexico's president however said he did broach the topic and told Trump Mexico would not pay. In a late evening television interview, an   Peña Nieto said: “His policy stances could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing. “That risk, that threat, must be confronted. I told him that is not the way to build a mutually beneficial relationship for both nations. ”  Clinton's campaign, sidelined by another day of Trump drama, seized on the discrepancy: “It turns out Trump didn't just choke, he got beat in the room and lied about it. ” The unexpected visit  —   Trump's first meeting with a head of state since he became a candidate  —   yielded presidential optics in the form of a podium and marble backdrop in an international setting. Speaking beneath a Mexican flag the casino   reality TV star sounded restrained and diplomatic. That evaporated when he bounded onto the podium in Phoenix, 200 miles north of the border, and seemed energised by the crowd, even though the cavernous convention centre was  . “There is only one core issue in the immigration debate and that is the wellbeing of the American people. Nothing even comes a close second. Our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens. ” The audience cheered and chanted “USA”. Maricopa county sheriff Joe Arpaio, a controversial hunter of suspected undocumented people, NY's former mayor Rudy Giuliani and Trump's running mate, Indiana governor Pence, warmed up the crowd before Trump arrived.  Supporters hailed his   foray as evidence he could negotiate with foreign leaders and secure US interests. George Buchanan, 71, a retired flooring installer, said it also showed courage. “It's dangerous. You've got those Mexican people over there, drug lords. The drug lords don't want him to build the wall. ” Some in the crowd sensed that behind the brash reiteration of mass deportations Trump was in fact edging towards a more moderate, viable, policy. “I think he's loosening up, becoming more realistic,” said Nancy Lewis, 56, a retired law enforcer. “And I'm OK with that. I have Hispanic friends. ” Michelle Des Marais, 78, appeared willing to forgive Trump if he did end up retreating. “It's a hard fight but at least he's trying. ”",False,"Trump has vowed anew to deport millions of undocumented people and to build a wall on the border with Mexico, defying expectations that he would soften his stance on immigration.

MMAjunkie first reported the news on Wendesday night saying that Silva might leave the world's leading mixed martial arts promotion by the end of the year. Silva maintains a    presence at the organization and is rarely interviewed, but his ability to assess fighters and pair them in intriguing matchups has been a big part of the UFC's success. His role predates the tenures of president Dana White and outgoing owners Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, who took over the UFC and made it a   dollar industry. A big part of the reason the UFC has been able to rise is the ability of their management to find compelling fights and package them in glossy    productions. Since the UFC controls the fate of their fighters, they mostly dictate the bouts. The fighters generally accept the proposed fights or risk being dropped. The MMAjunkie story says Silva is leaving after earning a share of the UFC's sale to   this summer. His timing might be fortuitous depending on how much interest Congress shows in trying to apply the Ali Act to mixed martial arts. Oklahoma congressman Markwayne Mullin is pushing to extend the 2000 boxing law to the UFC.  Among the Ali Act's provisions are stipulations that promoters must open their books to fighters, can't enter into   contracts with fighters and have to use independent rankings in putting together championship bouts. Application of the law could extend more power to the fighters, but it might also hamper the UFC's ability to put together the most attractive bouts.

That followed his opening win in similarly convincing fashion against the altogether different skills of Lukas Rosol on Monday. He added: “I got myself in a situation that maybe I could have avoided if I had taken one or two of the set points that I had at   or  . But I thought I did pretty well.

I didn't play that well during that period and managed to come through it, thankfully, and play some good stuff in the second and third sets. “I served at like 40, 42% first serves or something and still won in straight sets.

Among the passengers aboard JetBlue flight 387 from Fort Lauderdale to Santa Clara were many Cuban exiles returning to their homeland for the first time in years, and the US transport secretary, Anthony Foxx, headed for talks with his counterparts in Havana. Wednesday's historic flight, which took off 20 minutes late at 10. 05am after a lengthy party at the departure gate, will eventually lead to 110 flights to and from Cuba daily from the US. Foxx said he was expecting to announce the first dates for Havana later in the day. But for many of the passengers heading for the central Cuban city of Santa Clara on Wednesday, the journey was a celebration of the newfound personal freedoms the return of scheduled flights has brought, including the ability for travellers to book their own flights online at less than half the cost of the charter airlines who have been the mainstay of fractured travel links between the nations for the past 15 years. Among the first passengers to board was Nimaris   with fiance Mario Martínez and their two daughters, Daniella, three, and Olivia, 10 months. As a young girl in Sagua La Grande, González always dreamed of one day getting married in the tiny village church near her family's home, but gave up on the idea when she left Cuba for Florida as a teenager 13 years ago. It will be a busy weeklong trip for González, a surgery nurse in Orlando. She will celebrate her 30th birthday tonight with her younger brother, whom she has not seen for 12 years, and on Thursday the couple will finally get their marriage ceremony in a Cuban church. “I always wanted to get married in the church I grew up in, and our children will be baptised there on the same day, so it's a very emotional time,” González said. “The trip was sort of a birthday present, and for it to be on this flight today makes it more special. ” Martínez, 28, was born in Santa Clara but moved to central Florida with his parents as a child and has not been able to go home to visit his grandmother since 2004. “It's freedom for us in that we no longer have to go to agents where they charge $500 for a ticket,” he said. “It's good to see the relationship moving forward and travel opening up, but things in Cuba don't change much. ” Jet Blue is one of a handful of   airlines who won approval from the state department to operate to and from Cuba earlier this year following the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the government in Havana. It also offers flights to Camaguey and Holguín and hopes to add daily flights to Havana shortly. American Airlines, meanwhile, begins scheduled services from Miami, home to Florida's largest concentration of Cuban Americans, on 7 September. The airlines hope to cash in on a surge in visitors to Cuba from the US, which grew to 161, 000 in 2015, a 77% increase over the previous year according to government figures. Yet although the skies are reopening for the first time since the US broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961, two years after Fidel Castro's communist revolution, Obama has been unable to persuade Congress to lift the   trade embargo. To the Cuban government's chagrin, American citizens booking tickets must fall into one of 12 narrowly defined categories, including travel for religious, educational or cultural reasons. “This process of establishing regular flights is a step although the restrictions of the blockade remain, which among other things impede US citizens from travelling to our country as tourists,” the Cuban foreign minister, Eduardo Rodríguez Padilla, told reporters on Monday at a press conference in Havana. In an interview with the Guardian on Wednesday, Foxx said the Obama administration was working hard on continuing to bring down the barriers, a process announced publicly in December 2014 after months of secret talks with Cuban officials. “Today is one of the most tangible examples of the president's vision for restored diplomatic relations with Cuba,” Foxx said. “This is part of a larger objective we have right now to really nudge Cuba towards progress in the 21st century, economically, politically and on so many other fronts. ” Foxx said he planned to announce later on Wednesday the “slot allocations” to Havana for US airlines after a meeting with Rodríguez Padilla. “There are a few other areas we will explore on the transportation connections between the two countries and creating better access in the longer term. ” The restoration of air links follows the historic docking in Havana in May of the Carnival cruise ship Adonia, the first such voyage in five decades, carrying more than 700 passengers. Passenger Julio César Valdés, also from Santa Clara, was looking forward to reuniting with his parents Teresa and Osnedo at his childhood home, and spending time with his    sister. “It's a very emotional and wonderful day,” said Valdés, a medical assistant who lives in Jacksonville, Florida. “This is a new step in relations between the US and Cuba and I hope to see it progress further. ”   dentist Edelio González, 52, who has lived in south Florida for 36 years, said he has travelled regularly on charter flights to Santa Clara since 2001, but feels that today's flight was “a powerful moment”. “The first flight in more than 50 years is just historic,” said González, who will spend a week with his    sister. “I wanted to be here. ”",False,"To the lively beat of a salsa band, and with a water cannon   from airport fire trucks, the first commercial flight between the US and Cuba since 1961 took off from Florida on Wednesday, a symbolic next step in the new era of dtente between the former cold war adversaries.

232,104066,152706,How algorithms rule our working lives,Guardian,Cathy O'Neil,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/01/how-algorithms-rule-our-working-lives,"A few years ago, a young man named Kyle Behm took a leave from his studies at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He was suffering from bipolar disorder and needed time to get treatment. A year and a half later, Kyle was healthy enough to return to his studies at a different university. Around that time, he learned from a friend about a   job. It was just a   job at a Kroger supermarket, but it seemed like a sure thing. His friend, who was leaving the job, could vouch for him. For a   student like Kyle, the application looked like a formality. But Kyle didn't get called in for an interview. When he inquired, his friend explained to him that he had been “ ” by the personality test he'd taken when he applied for the job. The test was part of an employee selection program developed by Kronos, a workforce management company based outside Boston. When Kyle told his father, Roland, an attorney, what had happened, his father asked him what kind of questions had appeared on the test. Kyle said that they were very much like the “five factor model” test, which he'd been given at the hospital. That test grades people for extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to ideas. At first, losing one   job because of a questionable test didn't seem like such a big deal. Roland Behm urged his son to apply elsewhere. But Kyle came back each time with the same news. The companies he was applying to were all using the same test, and he wasn't getting offers. Roland Behm was bewildered. Questions about mental health appeared to be blackballing his son from the job market. He decided to look into it and soon learned that the use of personality tests for hiring was indeed widespread among large corporations. And yet he found very few legal challenges to this practice. As he explained to me, people who apply for a job and are   rarely learn that they were rejected because of their test results. Even when they do, they're not likely to contact a lawyer.  Membership Event: The Long Read live   at the Hospital Club  Behm went on to send notices to seven companies, including Home Depot and Walgreens, informing them of his intent to file a   suit alleging that the use of the exam during the job application process was unlawful. The suit, as I write this, is still pending. Arguments are likely to focus on whether the Kronos test can be considered a medical exam, the use of which in hiring is illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. If this turns out to be the case, the court will have to determine whether the hiring companies themselves are responsible for running afoul of the ADA, or if Kronos is. But the questions raised by this case go far beyond which particular company may or may not be responsible. Automatic systems based on complicated mathematical formulas, such as the one used to sift through Behm's job application, are becoming more common across the developed world. And given their scale and importance, combined with their secrecy, these algorithms have the potential to create an underclass of people who will find themselves increasingly and inexplicably shut out from normal life. It didn't have to be this way. After the financial crash, it became clear that the housing crisis and the collapse of major financial institutions had been aided and abetted by mathematicians wielding magic formulas. If we had been   we would have taken a step back at this point to figure out how we could prevent a similar catastrophe in the future. But instead, in the wake of the crisis, new mathematical techniques were hotter than ever, and expanding into still more domains. They churned   through petabytes of information, much of it scraped from social media or   websites. And increasingly they focused not on the movements of global financial markets but on human beings, on us. Mathematicians and statisticians were studying our desires, movements, and spending patterns. They were predicting our trustworthiness and calculating our potential as students, workers, lovers, criminals. This was the big data economy, and it promised spectacular gains. A computer program could speed through thousands of résumés or loan applications in a second or two and sort them into neat lists, with the most promising candidates on top. This not only saved time but also was marketed as fair and objective. After all, it didn't involve prejudiced humans digging through reams of paper, just machines processing cold numbers. By 2010 or so, mathematics was asserting itself as never before in human affairs, and the public largely welcomed it. Most of these algorithmic applications were created with good intentions. The goal was to replace subjective judgments with objective measurements in any number of fields  —   whether it was a way to locate the   teachers in a school or to estimate the chances that a prisoner would return to jail. These algorithmic “solutions” are targeted at genuine problems. School principals cannot be relied upon to consistently flag problematic teachers, because those teachers are also often their friends. And judges are only human, and being human they have prejudices that prevent them from being entirely fair  —   their rulings have been shown to be harsher right before lunch, when they're hungry, for example  —   so it's a worthy goal to increase consistency, especially if you can rest assured that the newer system is also scientifically sound. The difficulty is that last part. Few of the algorithms and scoring systems have been vetted with scientific rigour, and there are good reasons to suspect they wouldn't pass such tests. For instance, automated teacher assessments can vary widely from year to year, putting their accuracy in question. Tim Clifford, a NY City middle school English teacher of 26 years, got a 6 out of 100 in one year and a 96 the next, without changing his teaching style. Of course, if the scores didn't matter, that would be one thing, but sometimes the consequences are dire, leading to teachers being fired. There are also reasons to worry about scoring criminal defendants rather than relying on a judge's discretion. Consider the data pouring into the algorithms. In part, it comes from police interactions with the populace, which is known to be uneven, often  . The other kind of input, usually a questionnaire, is also troublesome. Some of them even ask defendants if their families have a history of being in trouble with the law, which would be unconstitutional if asked in open court but gets embedded in the defendant's score and labelled “objective”. It doesn't stop there. Algorithms are being used to determine how much we pay for insurance (more if your credit score is low, even if your driving record is clean) or what the terms of our loans will be, or what kind of political messaging we'll receive. There are algorithms that find out the weather forecast and only then decide on the work schedule of thousands of people, laying waste to their ability to plan for childcare and schooling, never mind a second job. Their popularity relies on the notion they are objective, but the algorithms that power the data economy are based on choices made by fallible human beings. And, while some of them were made with good intentions, the algorithms encode human prejudice, misunderstanding, and bias into automatic systems that increasingly manage our lives. Like gods, these mathematical models are opaque, their workings invisible to all but the highest priests in their domain: mathematicians and computer scientists. Their verdicts, even when wrong or harmful, are beyond dispute or appeal. And they tend to punish the poor and the oppressed in our society, while making the rich richer. That's what Kyle Behm learned the hard way. Finding work used to be largely a question of whom you knew. In fact, Kyle Behm was following the traditional route when he applied for work at Kroger. His friend had alerted him to the opening and put in a good word. For decades, that was how people got a foot in the door, whether at grocers, banks, or law firms. Candidates then usually faced an interview, where a manager would try to get a feel for them. All too often this translated into a single basic judgment: is this person like me (or others I get along with)? The result was a lack of opportunity for job seekers without a friend inside, especially if they came from a different race, ethnic group, or religion. Women also found themselves excluded by this insider game. Companies like Kronos brought science into corporate human resources in part to make the process fairer. Founded in the 1970s by MIT graduates, Kronos's first product was a new kind of punch clock, one equipped with a microprocessor, which added up employees' hours and reported them automatically. This may sound banal, but it was the beginning of the electronic push  —   now blazing along at warp speed  —   to track and optimise a workforce. As Kronos grew, it developed a broad range of software tools for workforce management, including a software program, Workforce Ready HR, that promised to eliminate “the guesswork” in hiring. According to its web page, Kronos “can help you screen, hire, and onboard candidates most likely to be productive  —   the   employees who will perform better and stay on the job longer”. Kronos is part of a growing industry. The hiring business is becoming automated, and many of the new programs include personality tests like the one Kyle Behm took. It is now a $500 million annual business and is growing by 10 to 15% a year, according to Hogan Assessment Systems Inc, a company that develops online personality tests. Such tests now are used on 60 to 70% of prospective workers in the US, and in the UK, according to the Association of Graduate Recruiters, 71% of employers use some form of psychometric test for recruitment. Even putting aside the issues of fairness and legality, research suggests that personality tests are poor predictors of job performance. Frank Schmidt, a business professor at the University of Iowa, analysed a century of workplace productivity data to measure the predictive value of various selection processes. Personality tests ranked low on the scale  —   they were only   as predictive as cognitive exams, and also far below reference checks. “The primary purpose of the test,” said Roland Behm, “is not to find the best employee. It's to exclude as many people as possible as cheaply as possible. ” You might think that personality tests would be easy to game. If you go online to take a five factor personality test, it looks like a cinch. One question asks: “Have frequent mood swings?” It would probably be smart to answer “very inaccurate. ” Another asks: “Get mad easily?” Again, check no. In fact, companies can get in trouble for screening out applicants on the basis of such questions. Regulators in Rhode Island found that CVS Pharmacy was illegally screening out applicants with mental illnesses when a personality test required respondents to agree or disagree with such statements as “People do a lot of things that make you angry” and “There's no use having close friends they always let you down. ” More intricate questions, which are harder to game, are more likely to keep the companies out of trouble. Consequently, many of the tests used today force applicants to make difficult choices, likely to leave them with a sinking feeling of “Damned if I do, damned if I don't”. McDonald's, for example, recently asked prospective workers to choose which of the following best described them: “It is difficult to be cheerful when there are many problems to take care of” or “Sometimes, I need a push to get started on my work. ” In 2014, the Wall Street Journal asked a psychologist who studies behaviour in the workplace, Tomas   to analyse thorny questions like these. The first of the two answers to the question from McDonald's,   said, captured “individual differences in neuroticism and conscientiousness” the second, “low ambition and drive”. So the prospective worker is pleading guilty to being either   or lazy. A Kroger supermarket question was far simpler: Which adjective best describes you at work, unique or orderly? Answering “unique” said   captures “high   openness and narcissism” while “orderly” expresses conscientiousness and  . Note that there's no option to answer “all of the above”. Prospective workers must pick one option, without a clue as to how the program will interpret it. And some of the analysis will draw unflattering conclusions. Defenders of the tests note that they feature lots of questions and that no single answer can disqualify an applicant. Certain patterns of answers, however, can and do disqualify them. And we do not know what those patterns are. We're not told what the tests are looking for. The process is entirely opaque. What's worse, after the model is calibrated by technical experts, it receives precious little feedback. Sports provide a good contrast here. Most professional basketball teams employ data geeks, who run models that analyse players by a series of metrics, including foot speed, vertical leap,   percentage, and a host of other variables. Teams rely on these models when deciding whether or not to recruit players. But if, say, the Los Angeles Lakers decide to pass on a player because his stats suggest that he won't succeed, and then that player subsequently becomes a star, the Lakers can return to their model to see what they got wrong. Whatever the case, they can work to improve their model. Now imagine that Kyle Behm, after getting   at Kroger, goes on to land a job at McDonald's. He turns into a stellar employee. He's managing the kitchen within four months and the entire franchise a year later. Will anyone at Kroger go back to the personality test and investigate how they could have got it so wrong? Not a chance, I'd say. The difference is this: Basketball teams are managing individuals, each one potentially worth millions of dollars. Their analytics engines are crucial to their competitive advantage, and they are hungry for data. Without constant feedback, their systems grow outdated and dumb. The companies hiring   workers, by contrast, act as if they are managing herds. They slash expenses by replacing human resources professionals with machines, and those machines filter large populations into more manageable groups. Unless something goes haywire in the workforce  —   an outbreak of kleptomania, say, or plummeting productivity  —   the company has little reason to tweak the filtering model. It's doing its job  —   even if it misses out on potential stars. The company may be satisfied with the status quo, but the victims of its automatic systems suffer. The majority of job applicants, thankfully, are not blackballed by automatic systems. But they still face the challenge of moving their application to the top of the pile and landing an interview. This has long been a problem for racial and ethnic minorities, as well as women. The ideal way to circumvent such prejudice is to consider applicants blindly. Orchestras, which had long been dominated by men, famously started in the 1970s to hold auditions with the musician hidden behind a sheet. Connections, reputations, race or alma mater no longer mattered. The music from behind the sheet spoke for itself. Since then, the percentage of women playing in major orchestras has leapt by a factor of five  —   though they still make up only a quarter of the musicians. The trouble is that few professions can engineer such an evenhanded tryout for job applicants. Musicians behind the sheet can actually perform the job they're applying for, whether it's a Dvořák cello concerto or bossa nova on guitar. In other professions, employers have to hunt through CVs, looking for qualities that might predict success. As you might expect, human resources departments rely on automatic systems to winnow down piles of résumés. In fact, in the US, some 72% of CVs are never seen by human eyes. Computer programs flip through them, pulling out the skills and experiences that the employer is looking for. Then they score each CV as a match for the job opening. It's up to the people in the human resources department to decide where the cutoff is, but the more candidates they can eliminate with this first screening, the fewer human hours they'll have to spend processing the top matches. So job applicants must craft their résumés with that automatic reader in mind. It's important, for example, to sprinkle the résumé liberally with words the specific job opening is looking for. This could include previous positions (sales manager, software architect) languages (Mandarin, Java) or honours (summa cum laude). Those with the latest information learn what machines appreciate and what tangles them up, and tailor their applications accordingly. The result of these programs is that those with the money and resources to prepare their résumés come out on top. Those who don't take these steps may never know that they're sending their résumés into a black hole. It's one more example in which the wealthy and informed get the edge and the poor are more likely to lose out. So far, we've been looking at models that filter out job candidates. For most companies, those models are designed to cut administrative costs and to reduce the risk of bad hires (or ones that might require more training). The objective of the filters, in short, is to save money. HR departments, of course, are also eager to save money through the hiring choices they make. One of the biggest expenses for a company is workforce turnover, commonly called churn. Replacing a worker earning $50, 000 a year costs a company about $10, 000, or 20% of that worker's yearly pay, according to the Center for American Progress. Replacing a   employee can cost as much as two years of salary. Naturally, many hiring models attempt to calculate the likelihood that a job candidate will stick around. Evolv, Inc, now a part of Cornerstone OnDemand, helped Xerox scout out prospects for its call centres, which employ more than 40, 000 people. The churn model took into account some of the metrics you might expect, including the average time people stuck around on previous jobs. But they also found some intriguing correlations. People the system classified as “creative types” tended to stay longer at the job, while those who scored high on “inquisitiveness” were more likely to set their questioning minds towards other opportunities. But the most problematic correlation had to do with geography. Job applicants who lived farther from the job were more likely to churn. This makes sense: long commutes are a pain. But Xerox managers noticed another correlation. Many of the people suffering those long commutes were coming from poor neighbourhoods. So Xerox, to its credit, removed that highly correlated churn data from its model. The company sacrificed a bit of efficiency for fairness. While churn analysis focuses on the candidates most likely to fail, the more strategically vital job for HR departments is to locate future stars, the people whose intelligence, inventiveness, and drive can change the course of an entire enterprise. In the higher echelons of the economy, companies are on the hunt for employees who think creatively and work well in teams. So the modellers' challenge is to pinpoint, in the vast world of big data, the bits of information that correlate with originality and social skills. A pioneer in this field is Gild, a San Francisco —  based startup. Extending far beyond a prospect's alma mater or résumé, Gild sorts through millions of job sites, analysing what it calls each person's “social data”. The company develops profiles of job candidates for its customers, mostly tech companies, keeping them up to date as the candidates add new skills. Gild claims that it can even predict when a star employee is likely to change jobs and can alert its customer companies when it's the right time to make an offer. But Gild's model attempts to quantify and also qualify each worker's “social capital”. How integral is this person to the community of fellow programmers? Do they share and contribute code? Say a Brazilian coder  —   Pedro, let's call him  —   lives in São Paulo and spends every evening from dinner to one in the morning in communion with fellow coders the world over, solving   problems or brainstorming gaming algorithms on sites such as GitHub or Stack Overflow. The model could attempt to gauge Pedro's passion (which probably gets a high score) and his level of engagement with others. It would also evaluate the skill and social importance of his contacts. Those with larger followings would count for more. If his principal online contact happened to be Google's Sergey Brin, say, Pedro's social score would no doubt shoot through the roof. But models like Gild's rarely receive such explicit signals from the data. So they cast a wider net, in search of correlations to workplace stardom wherever they can find them. And with more than six million coders in their database, the company can find all kinds of patterns. Vivienne Ming, Gild's chief scientist, said in an interview with Atlantic Monthly that Gild had found a bevy of talent frequenting a certain Japanese manga site. If Pedro spends time at that   site, of course, it doesn't predict superstardom. But it does nudge up his score. That makes sense for Pedro. But certain workers might be doing something else offline, which even the most sophisticated algorithm couldn't infer  —   at least not today. They might be taking care of children, for example, or perhaps attending a book group. The fact that prospects don't spend six hours discussing manga every evening shouldn't be counted against them. And if, like most of techdom, that manga site is dominated by males and has a sexist tone, a good number of the women in the industry will probably avoid it. Despite these issues, Gild's category of predictive model has more to do with rewarding people than punishing them. It is tame compared with   personality tests that exclude people from opportunities. Still, it's important to note that these hiring models are  . The world of data continues to expand, with each of us producing   streams of updates about our lives. All of this data will feed our potential employers insights into us. Will those insights be tested, or simply used to justify the status quo and reinforce prejudices? When I consider the sloppy and   ways that companies often use data, I'm reminded of phrenology, a pseudoscience that was briefly popular in the 19th century. Phrenologists would run their fingers over the patient's skull, probing for bumps and indentations. Each one, they thought, was linked to personality traits. If a patient was morbidly anxious or suffering from alcoholism, the skull probe would usually find bumps and dips that correlated with that observation  —   which, in turn, bolstered faith in the science of phrenology. Phrenology was a model that relied on pseudoscientific nonsense to make authoritative pronouncements, and for decades it went untested. Big data can fall into the same trap. Models like the ones that   Kyle Behm continue to lock people out, even when the “science” inside them is little more than a bundle of untested assumptions. • Mail illustration: Nathalie Lees, This essay is adapted from Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy, published by Allen Lane on 6 September, • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here",False,"A few years ago, a young man named Kyle Behm took a leave from his studies at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.

McDonald's, for example, recently asked prospective workers to choose which of the following best described them: It is difficult to be cheerful when there are many problems to take care of or Sometimes, I need a push to get started on my work.  In 2014, the Wall Street Journal asked a psychologist who studies behaviour in the workplace, Tomas   to analyse thorny questions like these. The first of the two answers to the question from McDonald's,   said, captured individual differences in neuroticism and conscientiousness the second, low ambition and drive. So the prospective worker is pleading guilty to being either   or lazy. A Kroger supermarket question was far simpler: Which adjective best describes you at work, unique or orderly? Answering unique said   captures high   openness and narcissism while orderly expresses conscientiousness and  . Note that there's no option to answer all of the above. Prospective workers must pick one option, without a clue as to how the program will interpret it. And some of the analysis will draw unflattering conclusions. Defenders of the tests note that they feature lots of questions and that no single answer can disqualify an applicant. Certain patterns of answers, however, can and do disqualify them. And we do not know what those patterns are. We're not told what the tests are looking for. The process is entirely opaque. What's worse, after the model is calibrated by technical experts, it receives precious little feedback. Sports provide a good contrast here. Most professional basketball teams employ data geeks, who run models that analyse players by a series of metrics, including foot speed, vertical leap,   percentage, and a host of other variables. Teams rely on these models when deciding whether or not to recruit players. But if, say, the Los Angeles Lakers decide to pass on a player because his stats suggest that he won't succeed, and then that player subsequently becomes a star, the Lakers can return to their model to see what they got wrong. Whatever the case, they can work to improve their model. Now imagine that Kyle Behm, after getting   at Kroger, goes on to land a job at McDonald's. He turns into a stellar employee. He's managing the kitchen within four months and the entire franchise a year later. Will anyone at Kroger go back to the personality test and investigate how they could have got it so wrong? Not a chance, I'd say. The difference is this: Basketball teams are managing individuals, each one potentially worth millions of dollars. Their analytics engines are crucial to their competitive advantage, and they are hungry for data. Without constant feedback, their systems grow outdated and dumb. The companies hiring   workers, by contrast, act as if they are managing herds. They slash expenses by replacing human resources professionals with machines, and those machines filter large populations into more manageable groups. Unless something goes haywire in the workforce     an outbreak of kleptomania, say, or plummeting productivity     the company has little reason to tweak the filtering model. It's doing its job     even if it misses out on potential stars. The company may be satisfied with the status quo, but the victims of its automatic systems suffer. The majority of job applicants, thankfully, are not blackballed by automatic systems. But they still face the challenge of moving their application to the top of the pile and landing an interview. This has long been a problem for racial and ethnic minorities, as well as women. The ideal way to circumvent such prejudice is to consider applicants blindly. Orchestras, which had long been dominated by men, famously started in the 1970s to hold auditions with the musician hidden behind a sheet. Connections, reputations, race or alma mater no longer mattered. The music from behind the sheet spoke for itself. Since then, the percentage of women playing in major orchestras has leapt by a factor of five     though they still make up only a quarter of the musicians. The trouble is that few professions can engineer such an evenhanded tryout for job applicants. Musicians behind the sheet can actually perform the job they're applying for, whether it's a Dvok cello concerto or bossa nova on guitar. In other professions, employers have to hunt through CVs, looking for qualities that might predict success. As you might expect, human resources departments rely on automatic systems to winnow down piles of rsums. In fact, in the US, some 72% of CVs are never seen by human eyes. Computer programs flip through them, pulling out the skills and experiences that the employer is looking for. Then they score each CV as a match for the job opening. It's up to the people in the human resources department to decide where the cutoff is, but the more candidates they can eliminate with this first screening, the fewer human hours they'll have to spend processing the top matches. So job applicants must craft their rsums with that automatic reader in mind. It's important, for example, to sprinkle the rsum liberally with words the specific job opening is looking for. This could include previous positions (sales manager, software architect) languages (Mandarin, Java) or honours (summa cum laude). Those with the latest information learn what machines appreciate and what tangles them up, and tailor their applications accordingly. The result of these programs is that those with the money and resources to prepare their rsums come out on top. Those who don't take these steps may never know that they're sending their rsums into a black hole. It's one more example in which the wealthy and informed get the edge and the poor are more likely to lose out. So far, we've been looking at models that filter out job candidates. For most companies, those models are designed to cut administrative costs and to reduce the risk of bad hires (or ones that might require more training). The objective of the filters, in short, is to save money. HR departments, of course, are also eager to save money through the hiring choices they make. One of the biggest expenses for a company is workforce turnover, commonly called churn. Replacing a worker earning $50, 000 a year costs a company about $10, 000, or 20% of that worker's yearly pay, according to the Center for American Progress. Replacing a   employee can cost as much as two years of salary. Naturally, many hiring models attempt to calculate the likelihood that a job candidate will stick around. Evolv, Inc, now a part of Cornerstone OnDemand, helped Xerox scout out prospects for its call centres, which employ more than 40, 000 people. The churn model took into account some of the metrics you might expect, including the average time people stuck around on previous jobs. But they also found some intriguing correlations. People the system classified as creative types tended to stay longer at the job, while those who scored high on inquisitiveness were more likely to set their questioning minds towards other opportunities. But the most problematic correlation had to do with geography. Job applicants who lived farther from the job were more likely to churn. This makes sense: long commutes are a pain. But Xerox managers noticed another correlation. Many of the people suffering those long commutes were coming from poor neighbourhoods. So Xerox, to its credit, removed that highly correlated churn data from its model. The company sacrificed a bit of efficiency for fairness. While churn analysis focuses on the candidates most likely to fail, the more strategically vital job for HR departments is to locate future stars, the people whose intelligence, inventiveness, and drive can change the course of an entire enterprise. In the higher echelons of the economy, companies are on the hunt for employees who think creatively and work well in teams. So the modellers' challenge is to pinpoint, in the vast world of big data, the bits of information that correlate with originality and social skills. A pioneer in this field is Gild, a San Francisco   based startup. Extending far beyond a prospect's alma mater or rsum, Gild sorts through millions of job sites, analysing what it calls each person's social data. The company develops profiles of job candidates for its customers, mostly tech companies, keeping them up to date as the candidates add new skills. Gild claims that it can even predict when a star employee is likely to change jobs and can alert its customer companies when it's the right time to make an offer. But Gild's model attempts to quantify and also qualify each worker's social capital. How integral is this person to the community of fellow programmers? Do they share and contribute code? Say a Brazilian coder     Pedro, let's call him     lives in So Paulo and spends every evening from dinner to one in the morning in communion with fellow coders the world over, solving   problems or brainstorming gaming algorithms on sites such as GitHub or Stack Overflow. The model could attempt to gauge Pedro's passion (which probably gets a high score) and his level of engagement with others. It would also evaluate the skill and social importance of his contacts. Those with larger followings would count for more. If his principal online contact happened to be Google's Sergey Brin, say, Pedro's social score would no doubt shoot through the roof. But models like Gild's rarely receive such explicit signals from the data. So they cast a wider net, in search of correlations to workplace stardom wherever they can find them. And with more than six million coders in their database, the company can find all kinds of patterns. Vivienne Ming, Gild's chief scientist, said in an interview with Atlantic Monthly that Gild had found a bevy of talent frequenting a certain Japanese manga site. If Pedro spends time at that   site, of course, it doesn't predict superstardom. But it does nudge up his score. That makes sense for Pedro. But certain workers might be doing something else offline, which even the most sophisticated algorithm couldn't infer     at least not today. They might be taking care of children, for example, or perhaps attending a book group. The fact that prospects don't spend six hours discussing manga every evening shouldn't be counted against them. And if, like most of techdom, that manga site is dominated by males and has a sexist tone, a good number of the women in the industry will probably avoid it. Despite these issues, Gild's category of predictive model has more to do with rewarding people than punishing them. It is tame compared with   personality tests that exclude people from opportunities. Still, it's important to note that these hiring models are  . The world of data continues to expand, with each of us producing   streams of updates about our lives. All of this data will feed our potential employers insights into us. Will those insights be tested, or simply used to justify the status quo and reinforce prejudices? When I consider the sloppy and   ways that companies often use data, I'm reminded of phrenology, a pseudoscience that was briefly popular in the 19th century. Phrenologists would run their fingers over the patient's skull, probing for bumps and indentations. Each one, they thought, was linked to personality traits. If a patient was morbidly anxious or suffering from alcoholism, the skull probe would usually find bumps and dips that correlated with that observation     which, in turn, bolstered faith in the science of phrenology. Phrenology was a model that relied on pseudoscientific nonsense to make authoritative pronouncements, and for decades it went untested. Big data can fall into the same trap. Models like the ones that   Kyle Behm continue to lock people out, even when the science inside them is little more than a bundle of untested assumptions.

233,105762,156194,Smith & Wesson profits jumped almost 50% after Orlando and Dallas shootings,Guardian,Jana Kasperkevic,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/smith-and-wesson-guns-profit-orlando-dallas-shootings,"Another quarter, another shooting, another boost in profits. America's second largest gunmaker posted a 49% jump in profits on Thursday, for the three months ending 31 July. Smith  Wesson's latest quarterly profits totaled $87. 6m, up from $58. 9m for the same period a year ago, the company announced on Thursday. The sales boost came in a period that included two of America's worst mass shootings, the Orlando nightclub shootings in June and the Dallas police shootings in July. “We are very pleased with our   results, which exceeded our financial guidance. We believe that higher revenue was driven by strong consumer demand as reflected in adjusted background checks from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) as well as our own market share gains,” James Debney, Smith  Wesson president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.  Nearly 2. 2m firearms background checks were processed this July, up from 1, 600, 832 last year. After those figures were reported on 1 August, Smith  Wesson shares surged and were trading at $30. 59 a share. The stock closed that day at an   high of $30. 36. As of Thursday, the NICS has yet to report the number of background check processed in August.  Background checks are not the most accurate way to predict sales as some checks do not result in sales and multiple firearms can be purchased with one background check. However, the metric is used to gauge the demand in the sector. The spike in demand driving up the value of gunmakers' stock has been attributed to increased calls for gun control regulations following a series of mass shootings. The news comes just months after the company announced $293. 8m in profits for its last fiscal year, a 50% increase on the year prior. Just before Smith  Wesson announced its total earnings for 2016, 49 people were killed at a gay club in Orlando. Not even a month later, five police officers were killed and seven were injured in shooting in Dallas. Gunmakers' stocks surged following both shootings. When speaking with investors in June, Debney said it was too early to tell if the Orlando shooting would have any impact on the sales of its firearms. The company's guidance for this quarter did not include a jump in demand.  Net sales for the quarter were $207m compared with $147. 8m for the first quarter last year, an increase of 40. 1%. This is Smith  Wesson's first quarterly report since it acquired Crimson Trace, which specializes in laser sighting systems, and Taylor Brands, a designer and distributor of knives. At the beginning of 2016, the company announced that it was looking to expand into the outdoor sporting goods market so as to not be   on the volatile demand for guns. The expansion plan announced in January could take up to five years to execute. With these acquisitions, Smith  Wesson is on the way to “become a leader in the market for shooting, hunting and rugged outdoor enthusiasts” Debney said. Considering the acquisitions and the strong performance in the first quarter, the company has revised its outlook and raised its full year revenue and net income guidance.

234,106102,156656,Leipzig flat made famous in Capa war photo becomes poignant memorial,Guardian,Kate Connolly,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/01/leipzig-flat-poignant-memorial-clean-beautiful-death-robert-capa-second-world-war,"Robert Capa called them his most definitive images of the second world war. Seconds after the photographer had taken a portrait of a   sergeant poised with a heavy machine gun on a Leipzig balcony, the soldier slumped to the floor. On 18 April 1945, in the final days of the conflict, he had been hit and killed by the bullets of a German sniper. Capa climbed through a balcony window into the flat to photograph the dead man, who lay in the open door, a looted Luftwaffe sheepskin helmet on his head. The subsequent series of photographs show the rapid spread of the soldier's blood across the parquet floor as other GIs attended to him and his fellow gunner took over his post at the machine gun. “It was a very clean, somehow very beautiful death and I think that's what I remember most from the war,” Capa recalled two years later in a radio interview.  The images were wired back to NY and featured prominently in Life magazine's Victory edition on 14 May. The soldier, Raymond J Bowman, 21, of Rochester, NY, was later hailed as The Last Man to Die by Capa and the photographs would become some of the most memorable images of the second world war. But their origins would have remained obscure had a group of Leipzigers interested in highlighting and preserving the city's   Capa connection not discovered that a derelict   apartment block was where the photographer, embedded with the US army during the capture of the city, had taken the pictures. Learning that the building was destined for demolition four years ago, the group set about trying to save it. And save it they have: following a €10. 5m (£9m) refurbishment, including shoring up the foundations and replacing the balconies, the Capa Haus has been restored to its former glory.  Strips of Jahnallee have been renamed Bowman Strasse and Capa Strasse. In the elegant ground floor Cafe Eigler a permanent exhibition is dedicated to The Last Man series and other Capa pictures which tell the story of 18 April. “There was very little in the city to recall the last days of [the second world war],” said Meigl Hoffmann, “and we were struck by what a poignant and authentic memorial this actually was. ” Hoffman, 48, a Leipzig political cabaret artist and one of the founding members of the Capa Haus initiative, grew up with the many wartime stories of his parents and grandparents. But the US army's role in liberating Leipzig from nazism had been an unfashionable version of events during the days of communism when the dominant story was of how the Red Army  —   which arrived in July  —   had saved his city.  “As a result the Capa connection had been suppressed because his pictures told the unfavourable story of the US troops, and so for years no one here really knew about them, they were considered subversive,” said Hoffmann.  He discovered the Last Man to Die images in a banned underground magazine at the age of 19. “I was electrified by the pictures  —   they appeared 3D to me, and because a lot of the photos we knew in the East German era were in black and white, they struck me as being very contemporary,” Hoffmann explained. He and a friend set about trying to locate the balcony, aided by Capa's description of the “big apartment building that overlooked the bridge” on which German soldiers “were putting up considerable resistance” as well as visual references in the photograph itself. “But the only building that matched the description didn't seem to fit at all, as it had no balcony,” said Hoffmann. The place he found  —   Jahnallee 61  —   was on a busy crossroads in the west of the city. He clambered with trepidation through its broken ceilings and floorboards, finding the “nice bourgeois apartment” on the second floor as Capa had described it, a shell of its former self.  But, surprisingly, unlike the rest of the building, it was largely intact  —   apart from the fact that its balcony, close to collapse, had been removed years before  —   and it still had the commanding, unobstructed view of the Zeppelin Bridge. With weeks to go before the wrecking ball was due to knock it down, the initiative contacted US war veterans involved in the battle for Leipzig.  Bowman, the fifth of seven children, had been sent to Europe with Company D of the 23rd Infantry Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Division. He was taking it in turns with his fellow gunner, Lehman Riggs, 24, to operate the . 30 calibre Browning. Riggs had just stepped back inside the apartment and was reloading the gun as the fatal bullet struck. The grandfather clock behind which Riggs took shelter showed  —   in brighter exposures of the photographs  —   that Bowman died at 3. 15pm. Riggs, now 96 and living in Cookeville, Tennessee, said his memories of the incident had rushed back during a recent return visit to the apartment.  “The event had so disturbed my mind because of the loss of my buddy, I had tried to block it, and hadn't talked about it for years,” the retired postal worker said. “But returning to the scene unlocked all the memories. ” He recalled Bowman as a “very kind young man”. “I was 3ft from him when it happened. I could have reached out and touched him, but I knew he was dead. I had to carry on in his place, as I'd been trained to do. ” Events had happened so fast, he said, from the order to “run into an upper floor of the house and offer cover for our troops so they could come across the bridge” to the death of his partner, that he had been unaware of Capa's presence.  “In combat we often had army photographers with us. I thought he was just another one of those. ”  He contacted his wife to buy Life magazine on learning that he featured in it, but described it as “extremely painful” to view the pictures once he returned from the war, “as they made me vividly relive what had happened”. Robert Petzold, from Leipzig, who was 13 at the time, recalled the phone call he received from his grandmother the previous evening. “She lived a few kilometres further west and had seen that the Americans were arriving in Leipzig,” he said.  “She told us: ‘The enemy is coming, have a hearty breakfast. '”After doing just that, he, his mother and sister took cover in the air raid shelter in the basement and, while they could hear the heavy exchange of fire, they had little inkling of the drama that had unfolded on the balcony where, Petzold recalled, “I used to keep rabbits. ” Once they were given the   his mother returned to their flat to the horrifying scene of the dead soldier in her living room. “His blood was all over the floor, and soaked into a rug. On a dresser in the hallway she found letters and photographs that had been removed from his pocket, showing a woman and children. She said: ‘They may be our enemies, but they suffer the same fate as us,'” Petzold said. For years, he said, his mother tried in vain to remove the blood stains from the rug. “But nothing, no chemical process, could get rid of them  —   they served to us as a permanent reminder of the horror of what had happened. ”  A dining room table in an adjoining room that was used by other members of the machine gun platoon had dents on its underside from the recoil motion of the gun. “The soldiers had been thoughtful enough to turn the table top upside down to avoid damaging it. My mother was always very impressed by that,” he recalled. Raymond Bowman's mother, Florence, at first refused to believe reports her son had died. When her other son contacted Bowman's army unit for further confirmation, he was told to buy a copy of Life. There the family recognised the pin with the initials RB, which Bowman had made in high school. The Capa Haus initiative, which was accompanied by personal appeals to city authorities by Riggs, Petzold and members of the Bowman family to save the historic site, led to approaches by a Munich investor, who prides himself on his track record of saving historic buildings that “tell stories”.    “It was an important picture but one that Capa almost didn't take,” said Christoph Kaufmann, of Leipzig's Civic History Museum and the main curator of the exhibition, pointing to Capa's own take on the incident, in the only known recording of the photographer's strong   voice. “He'd just moved on to the open balcony and put up that heavy machine gun,” Capa said. “But God, the war was over, who wanted to see one more picture of somebody shooting?   …     But he looked so   and he was one of the men who looked like if it would be the first day of the war he still was earnest about it   …     So I said: ‘All right, this will be my last picture of war.' And I put my camera and took a portrait shot of him. ” Katrin Stein now lives in the apartment, her balcony painted   and adorned with geraniums and a wash stand.  “I try not to think too much about what happened here,” she said, standing in the balcony doorway where Bowman fell. “But it certainly adds another dimension to the history I learned in school. ” ",False,"Robert Capa called them his most definitive images of the second world war.

Raymond Bowman's mother, Florence, at first refused to believe reports her son had died. When her other son contacted Bowman's army unit for further confirmation, he was told to buy a copy of Life. There the family recognised the pin with the initials RB, which Bowman had made in high school. The Capa Haus initiative, which was accompanied by personal appeals to city authorities by Riggs, Petzold and members of the Bowman family to save the historic site, led to approaches by a Munich investor, who prides himself on his track record of saving historic buildings that tell stories.    It was an important picture but one that Capa almost didn't take, said Christoph Kaufmann, of Leipzig's Civic History Museum and the main curator of the exhibition, pointing to Capa's own take on the incident, in the only known recording of the photographer's strong   voice. He'd just moved on to the open balcony and put up that heavy machine gun, Capa said. But God, the war was over, who wanted to see one more picture of somebody shooting?        But he looked so   and he was one of the men who looked like if it would be the first day of the war he still was earnest about it        So I said: All right, this will be my last picture of war.' And I put my camera and took a portrait shot of him.  Katrin Stein now lives in the apartment, her balcony painted   and adorned with geraniums and a wash stand.  I try not to think too much about what happened here, she said, standing in the balcony doorway where Bowman fell. But it certainly adds another dimension to the history I learned in school.  "

It documented the    disappointments of    life in a small town. Mallrats, on the other hand, featured Smith as his   Silent Bob, flying around a set, and a scene where a man eats pretzels covered in human excrement.

236,106558,157295,Lady Leshurr: ‘They wanted to pit me against Nicki Minaj – I wasn't feeling that',Guardian,Alexis Petridis,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/01/lady-leshurr-they-wanted-to-pit-me-against-nicki-minaj-i-wasnt-feeling-that,"Lady Leshurr has just come back from the US. She has been spending a lot of time there this year, she says: “We've been to Atlanta, LA, New Orleans, Miami, NY. ” She played a   gig in the latter, the audience's enthusiasm apparently undimmed by the fact that she raps with a distinct Brummie twang: “I didn't think they'd be able to understand me, didn't think my accent, of all accents, would have crossed over like that. But they were singing my lyrics back at me. It was hilarious, hearing people with American accents saying ‘bredrin' and ‘wasteman' all that British urban slang. ” But mostly, she's been working on her debut album. “Working with a producer called Deputy, who made Rihanna's Bitch Better Have My Money Bangladesh, he made Lil' Wayne's A Milli, and Diva and Video Phone for Beyoncé. I've got a session with Scott Storch, he's coming back now as well. And you know Timbaland?” Timbaland, the celebrated, groundbreaking producer of Missy Elliott, Aaliyah, Justin Timberlake and Beyoncé? The visionary auteur behind more than 100 hit singles on both sides of the Atlantic? I'm aware of his work, yes. “Well, I've been doing a few bits with Timbaland. Timbaland is amazing. He just rang me up on my mobile one day. ” The girl born Melesha O'Garro giggles. “I'm just working with a few legendary producers. ” Here, should you want it, is empirical evidence of UK rap's sudden ascent to prominence in the US, a country traditionally resistant to the charms of the British MC, and, moreover, of the fact that a lot of people think Lady Leshurr is about to become very famous indeed. In fact, she's already famous  —   over the course of our interview outside of a north London wine bar, she's interrupted not once, not twice, but three times by fans. Her fame is largely thanks to a series of five freestyles called The Queen's Speech, which she released herself on iTunes and uploaded to YouTube, accompanied by   videos, becoming a viral sensation. Last August's Queen's Speech 4 racked up a fairly staggering 31m views. Their lyrics were both dextrous and extremely funny, a blur of highly original    —   “I'll upload a picture of your dog and sell it on Gumtree”  —   and   references they also frequently came equipped with the kind of hooklines you can imagine being chanted in playgrounds: “That's nasty, change your panties” “Brush your teeth” “Your lips look like crispy bacon”. Moreover, they seem to have attracted a different audience compared with other UK rappers. “I've seen videos of    women and men in America saying ‘Brush your teeth' and stuff, videos of a little baby watching it and laughing, do you know what I mean? I get parents saying to me: ‘Wow, you're the only artist I let my kids listen to,' because I don't swear in my lyrics. I just don't think it's necessary. My mum brought me up really well, I don't swear unless I'm really, really angry. “Everyone's too cool, everyone wants to be drinking alcohol in their videos and driving flash cars, wearing big chains. I don't want to do that, because I don't live that. All my music, you'll never see me with my breasts hanging out or showing so much flesh that you can't show it to your kids or things like that. Because, one, I respect myself as a person two, I want to make people understand that you don't have to go that route to be successful. If you've got the talent, let the talent talk. Look at what I'm wearing afterwards, if you have to, but listen to me first, do you know what I mean?” In person, Lady Leshurr is charismatic and funny and smart. You can see why her new major record label  —   she's signed to Sony's RCA imprint  —   might think she's a hot prospect in the past 12 months, she has gone from a hugely productive   cottage industry, of the kind that's fuelled grime's commercial resurgence in Britain, to an artist that Timbaland and co are queuing up to work with. “All these major established artists reaching out,” she frowns. “I had people like Akon calling my phone. Busta Rhymes. I've no idea how he even got my number. Young Money Records tried to reach out to sign me. ” She laughs again. “I'm saying it all like it's so casual, but it's just because I don't really let things excite me like that. I try to be calm with it. I'm not like: ‘Oh my God, oh my God. '” Perhaps that's something to do with the fact that she's been here, or at least somewhere like it, before. When the Observer profiled her, in 2013, her career appeared to be about to blast off: a major label had offered her a deal, her single Blazin' had just deposed Justin Timberlake from No 1 on the MTV Base chart, she was talking about launching a clothing line, Friggin' L, winningly named after one of her mixtapes. But then everything went wrong, of which more later. Or perhaps it's something to do with her background, which is substantially grimmer than the bubbly image she projects suggests. Before she became a rapper, she says, she started out writing poetry “because I wanted to express myself. I grew up in a very strict family. My father was very strict, very violent: he had been brought up in a violent background and it's probably just a cycle. But I think that was the push to try and express myself in another way. I couldn't really express myself to him or anybody else. I was very shy, always looked down, I'd never have any eye contact with people, so I put all that into poetry, writing down my frustration, what I felt and what I'd seen, or stuff written from my mum's view, as if I was my mother. I started thinking, ‘You know what? Why don't I just rap?' Because it's just poetry with a beat behind it, really. ” She learnt to “rap, produce, mix, master, everything” at a youth club across the road from her home in Solihull. “We would all be in one room with the mic, someone would be DJing, the lights would be off, it'd just be sweaty, loads of men. No other girls at all. At first, they were like: ‘She's good for a girl' or ‘Ah, she's sick because there's no other girls about'  —   there was always an excuse. So I thought: Fine, I'm going to show you that I'm better than the next man, not ‘good for a female'. So it pushed me to work hard, to write the best. ” She produced her first mixtape at 14: “I had no idea how to promote, or how to get my things in shops, so I just used to leave CDs on the bus when I was on my way to school. I'd hand them out to strangers, leave them on park benches, anywhere I thought people might see them and pick them up. ” Amazingly, it was a strategy that worked. Someone uploaded its contents to a website  —   “I can't even remember what it was called, but it was big for UK artists at the time and it got loads of hits”  —   but her burgeoning career was still hampered by her home life. “I wasn't allowed out of my area. I wasn't allowed to go anywhere my friends were allowed to go to. I was always told by my father: ‘No, you're not allowed to do this no, you're not going to make it.' There was a time when he sat all the brothers and sisters down in a room and he wrote down job professions and he put them in a hat and whatever we picked out, we had to be. So all my sisters are like nurses, carers, my brothers are carpenters, mechanics, but I wouldn't do it. I knew that if I picked what was in that hat, I'd have to start studying for it. Me and one brother who's now a footballer were the only ones stood up to him. It caused a whole heap of madness, and I just ran away for a couple of hours. He wasn't there when I got back, and from that point, I was just trying to dodge him. ” She left home after landing a role in a local film called One Day by rapping for the director. The film was withdrawn from cinemas  —   “It was about gangs in Birmingham and when they showed it in Birmingham both gangs turned up to the cinema and people got stabbed and stuff”  —   but it brought her to the attention of “Wiley and Kano and Ghetts, all these people I'd grown up listening to . .. I didn't tell my parents I was moving to London. I just packed one suitcase, I left and I never went back. I think I told my mum I was going on a trip with the college or something. ” Her real break came when she uploaded a   parody video of Chris Brown and Busta Rhymes's Look At Me Now to YouTube: it got 100, 000 views in half a day, and Atlantic Records in the US offered her a deal. “They flew me out and we had a conversation, but their idea was that they were going to pit me against Nicki Minaj. It was like: ‘She's the biggest female MC and you need to take her down,' and I wasn't feeling that at all. That whole stereotype of female rappers and their supporters having to compete with each other  —   it seems to be a crime to be a fan of two female rappers that are successful. So I turned it down. The amount of money they were offering me was amazing. I've always turned to music to get my mum out of the house, out of that situation, so to see that type of money thrown at me . .. I'm not going to lie, I cried on the plane home, because I thought I'd made a mistake and my mum needed the money. It might have been my only chance. But I know by now I would probably have been dropped and my career would have been ruined. ” Back in the UK, she elected to put her career on hold for a year. “I was going through a lot myself, personally. I was living on couches, living out of bags and boxes, sometimes I wouldn't even know where I was sleeping the next day. And then I went through a situation where someone completely tried to destroy my career, someone I thought was a friend, who deleted all my social networks. So I had to start again, basically. So I was like: ‘You know what? I'm starting again as a brand new artist if you're going to do that.' I thought: I grew up on Missy, Eminem, Busta Rhymes, they had all those funny, rewatchable videos with crazy visuals and I think that's what was and still is missing in the scene. Humour was definitely something I thought would work, I thought it would be different if I brought that to the scene, with the beats I'm using, which I  . I wouldn't quite call them grime, they're a bit slower, people say they're a bit trap. I just wanted to create something new and fresh. ” It was a plan that has clearly worked beyond her wildest dreams, although she says she's keen not to be seen as just “a funny person . .. The album's going to do the talking, because everyone's thinking this is all I do, the funny stuff, and the album's going to show that it's not. ” The album isn't the only thing on her mind at the moment. She's still thinking about a clothing line, although, alas, the Friggin' L name has been retired. She's talking about going back into acting. She's starting work on her own sketch show, starring a selection of   she created on Snapchat. Whatever happens, she says, she has already managed to achieve her dream: with the money she made from The Queen's Speech's iTunes sales and YouTube hits, she's buying her mum a house. “I just kept setting money aside, and it's all still in the process at the moment. You know how mortgages are. But I'm eventually going to take her there, and it's going to have a massive bow on it, and I'm going to pretend it's my house that I've bought in Birmingham and then tell her it's hers. She has no idea. ” Unless she reads this, of course. She drains her glass of fizzy wine. “So much has happened just because of uploading a couple of videos, you know. I've had all these offers and artists reaching out, I've got to fly around the world and experiment with things I've never tried before. I've got half a million subscribers on my YouTube channel, I've got my own machine. So, that's basically made me realise: I'm on the up. ”",False,"Lady Leshurr has just come back from the US.

Her real break came when she uploaded a   parody video of Chris Brown and Busta Rhymes's Look At Me Now to YouTube: it got 100, 000 views in half a day, and Atlantic Records in the US offered her a deal. They flew me out and we had a conversation, but their idea was that they were going to pit me against Nicki Minaj. It was like: She's the biggest female MC and you need to take her down,' and I wasn't feeling that at all. That whole stereotype of female rappers and their supporters having to compete with each other     it seems to be a crime to be a fan of two female rappers that are successful. So I turned it down. The amount of money they were offering me was amazing. I've always turned to music to get my mum out of the house, out of that situation, so to see that type of money thrown at me . .. I'm not going to lie, I cried on the plane home, because I thought I'd made a mistake and my mum needed the money. It might have been my only chance. But I know by now I would probably have been dropped and my career would have been ruined.  Back in the UK, she elected to put her career on hold for a year. I was going through a lot myself, personally. I was living on couches, living out of bags and boxes, sometimes I wouldn't even know where I was sleeping the next day. And then I went through a situation where someone completely tried to destroy my career, someone I thought was a friend, who deleted all my social networks. So I had to start again, basically. So I was like: You know what? I'm starting again as a brand new artist if you're going to do that.' I thought: I grew up on Missy, Eminem, Busta Rhymes, they had all those funny, rewatchable videos with crazy visuals and I think that's what was and still is missing in the scene. Humour was definitely something I thought would work, I thought it would be different if I brought that to the scene, with the beats I'm using, which I  . I wouldn't quite call them grime, they're a bit slower, people say they're a bit trap. I just wanted to create something new and fresh.  It was a plan that has clearly worked beyond her wildest dreams, although she says she's keen not to be seen as just a funny person . .. The album's going to do the talking, because everyone's thinking this is all I do, the funny stuff, and the album's going to show that it's not.  The album isn't the only thing on her mind at the moment. She's still thinking about a clothing line, although, alas, the Friggin' L name has been retired. She's talking about going back into acting. She's starting work on her own sketch show, starring a selection of   she created on Snapchat. Whatever happens, she says, she has already managed to achieve her dream: with the money she made from The Queen's Speech's iTunes sales and YouTube hits, she's buying her mum a house. I just kept setting money aside, and it's all still in the process at the moment. You know how mortgages are. But I'm eventually going to take her there, and it's going to have a massive bow on it, and I'm going to pretend it's my house that I've bought in Birmingham and then tell her it's hers. She has no idea.  Unless she reads this, of course. She drains her glass of fizzy wine. So much has happened just because of uploading a couple of videos, you know. I've had all these offers and artists reaching out, I've got to fly around the world and experiment with things I've never tried before. I've got half a million subscribers on my YouTube channel, I've got my own machine. So, that's basically made me realise: I'm on the up. "
237,106720,157527,Penn State plan to honor Joe Paterno prompts furious backlash,Guardian,,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/penn-state-joe-paterno-anniversary-backlash,"Penn State's athletic department on Thursday announced plans to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Joe Paterno's first game as coach, a move that sparked backlash on social networks by people critical of Paterno's role in the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal. The university announced plans Thursday to mark the anniversary when the Nittany Lions football team hosts Temple on 17 September. University spokesman Jeff Nelson told the Associated Press that Penn State plans to announce specifics of the commemoration to ticket holders during the week of the game. He declined further comment on the plans. Paterno coached at Penn State for 46 seasons, becoming college football's winningest coach. But the coach was fired by the school's board of trustees shortly after Sandusky, who was his defensive coordinator, was arrested in November 2011 for child sexual abuse. Paterno died in January 2012 of lung cancer. The announcement to honor Paterno's first game was met with disdain on social media sites from those who partially blame Paterno for the scandal.  In May, unsealed court documents said an alleged Sandusky victim said he complained to Paterno about Sandusky in 1976 and was rebuffed. The university's president has said the allegation was not substantiated in court or tested by any other process. Paterno was never charged with a crime related to the scandal. Sandusky was convicted on 45 of 48 charges in June 2012 and is serving a   to   sentence. Moving forward from the scandal has proven a difficult challenge for Penn State, requiring leaders to balance distancing the university from the scandal while juggling the wishes of ardent Penn State supporters who credit Paterno for giving the university an identity to be proud of.  “Depending on their position people may look at him differently, but it doesn't change that he created that here. Or helped to create that here,” athletic director Sandy Barbour told the AP in August. The Paterno Foundation had already scheduled a private celebration of the 50th anniversary of Paterno's first game as head coach with a Football Lettermen's reunion on 16 September at Lubrano Park in State College. Penn State alum and university trustee Anthony Lubrano has been part of a group of Paterno supporters that have been pushing for the school to officially recognize the anniversary. The statue of Paterno was removed from outside Beaver Stadium on 22 July 2012 and highly visible, university sponsored signs of him are mostly hard to find. Paterno's name is still on the campus library, which was built in part by his donations.

238,107059,158005,Obama administration denies secret loopholes in Iran nuclear agreement,Guardian,Julian Borger,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/obama-secret-iran-nuclear-deal,"The Obama administration has insisted that the terms of a nuclear agreement signed last year with Iran were being upheld after a Washington think tank alleged that Tehran had been granted secret exemptions.  A report by the Institute for Science and International Security alleged that a joint commission set up to implement the Vienna deal had allowed Iran to keep more than the agreed maximum of 300 kg of low enriched uranium (LEU) by excluding waste material in Iran's nuclear facilities. If enriched further, LEU could be used in a nuclear warhead.  The institute's director and   of the report, David Albright, said that this and other exemptions were granted by the commission in secret.  “One of the biggest problems is we are being denied information in these cases,” Albright said. “If the joint commission has so many powers to change this deal, shouldn't we know what they're doing?” The state department denied that the 300 kg LEU limit set down in the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPOA) had been breached.  “There's been no loosening of the commitments and Iran has not and will not under the JCPOA be allowed to exceed the limits that are spelled out in the JCPOA,” spokesman John Kirby said. He added the only violation of the terms of the deal had been a temporary surplus in Iran's export of heavy water (which can be used in nuclear reactors to produce plutonium) but that had been corrected. Kirby also said the secrecy of the work of the joint commission, which represents all parties to the deal, was stipulated in last year's deal, signed by six world powers (the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China) the EU and Iran. “This is in compliance with the JCPOA which says the commission's work should be confidential unless all parties agree otherwise,” Kirby said.  However, while he repeatedly stated there had no been “no exceptions” to the quantitative limits set down in the agreement, Kirby did not respond directly to the question of exemptions. Albright's report claimed certain waste products and residues were not being included in the joint commission's inventory of nuclear materials. Kirby said he would not “talk about the specific work of the joint commission” As well as noting the   surplus, Albright's report said that “lab contaminant” containing 20% enriched uranium was being overlooked by the commission, and that Iran had been allowed to retain 19 “hot cells” larger than the specifications laid down in the JCPOA. Hot cells are special containers that allow technicians to handle radioactive matter with special gloves while being shielded. They can be used to separate plutonium from spent fuel on a small scale.  Kirby noted that the joint commission was given the authority to approve larger hot cells than envisaged in the agreement.  “We aren't saying anything has been violated here,” Albright said. “But the number of these hot cells is surprising. We don't know how many are being monitored by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] and again, why is this secret?” Jim Walsh, an international security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that it was the norm for arms control agreements to have secret sections.  “Secret doesn't mean evil. It's just standard operating procedure, and as this report says itself, Obama notified Congress. Congress has known this from the beginning,” Walsh said. On the question of the “hot cells” Walsh added: “The report admits these are being used for producing medical isotopes. There is no plutonium reactor in Iran. A reactor is years away, so allowing the existing hot cells is not a proliferation danger. ”  James Acton, the   of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: “The more complicated and comprehensive your arms control agreement, the more questions it throws up in implementation. “Under the Chemical Weapons Convention, the US had to destroy its stockpile by 2012, but it wasn't possible to meet that deadline.

239,116587,172077,6 Things You Might Not Have Known About Trump's Border Enforcement Plan,NPR,Scott Horsley,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/492270569/6-things-you-might-not-have-known-about-trump-s-border-enforcement-plan,"To carry out his   immigration policy, Trump proposed hiring 5, 000 additional Border Patrol agents and tripling the number of ”deportation officers.” But that would continue an already   expansion of the government agencies responsible for those tasks  —   even as the number of illegal border crossers has shrunk dramatically. That's not even to mention the billions of dollars it would cost to build a    wall across the length of the entire U. S.  border. Here are six things to consider: 1. Border Patrol agents have doubled and the 2013 Senate bill proposed a bigger increase than Trump: The number of authorized agents has more than doubled since 2002 to more than 21, 000. (According to the National Border Patrol Council, the officers union, about 1, 500 of those authorized positions are unfilled owing to attrition.) Trump's proposal would represent a 24 percent increase in authorized jobs. The bipartisan immigration bill passed by the Senate in 2013 would have gone even further, expanding the Border Patrol to more than 38, 000. Federal spending on the Border Patrol has also grown rapidly, climbing from $1. 4 billion in fiscal year 2002 to $3. 8 billion last year. 2. Apprehensions are down: Despite the growing number of officers patrolling the border, fewer   crossers are being caught. Apprehensions have fallen 79 percent from their peak in 2000. This is generally seen as a sign that fewer people are trying to cross the border illegally. Increased border security and a   U. S. economy are thought to have discouraged illegal immigration. The Pew Research Center found that more Mexicans left the USA than entered between 2009 and 2014. 3. Spending on enforcement is way up: As with the Border Patrol, federal spending on Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which shares responsibility for enforcing immigration law, has already jumped by 84 percent since 2005. Trump did not say how he would raise the money to triple the ICE deportation force. 4. Deportations  —   or ”removals” in ICE parlance  —   increased during Obama's first four years in office, reaching a peak of 409, 849 in 2012. Since then, deportations have been dropping to a low of 235, 413 last year. Since 2014, the Obama administration has focused on deporting recent arrivals and criminals. There have been fewer deportations of immigrants who have lived in the U. S. for years and whose only crime was crossing the border illegally. In all, about 2. 8 million have been deported under Obama. Unlike this president, though, Trump says there should be no path to legalization for these longtime immigrants, short of returning to their home countries and reapplying for admission. Trump stopped short of repeating his call for mass deportation, saying the status of these immigrants could be addressed ”in several years,” after a ”great wall” is completed and illegal flows are ended for good. In the meantime, he wants to prioritize deportation of ”criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays” and those who rely on public welfare, along with ”millions of recent illegal arrivals.” The Washington Post estimates that, in all, some 6 million people could be subject to deportation if Trump's promised policies were to take effect. 5. Criminal deportation because of   or something else? Trump said there are ”at least 2 million criminal aliens now inside the country,” who would be deported immediately if he becomes president. That figure comes from an analysis of ICE data by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for low immigration. According to the center's executive director, Mark Krikorian, that figure includes immigrants living legally in the U. S. whose criminal record makes them eligible for deportation. Trump suggested the only reason criminals haven't been deported already is federal  . ”The local police know who every one of these criminals are,” he said. ”They've put up with it for years. And now, finally, we will turn the tables and law enforcement will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.” In fact, local and state governments sometimes refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials, for fear that overzealous deportation practices would target   offenders and alienate local immigrant communities. 6.

240,116588,172078,"Trump Makes Nice In Mexico, Talks Tougher Than Ever Just Hours Later In Phoenix",NPR,Ron Elving,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/492196408/trump-makes-nice-in-mexico-talks-tougher-than-ever-just-hours-later-in-phoenix,"Trump has provided the political world with many moving moments over the past year, but none quite like the whiplash mood swing between his daytime and nighttime performances in Mexico City and Phoenix on Wednesday. In the daylight hours, Trump struck his most presidential pose to date with a solemn (if somewhat grumpy) reading of prepared remarks at a news conference alongside Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto. That somber event, inside the Mexican presidential residence, epitomized the more moderate image Trump has pursued on immigration issues over the past 10 days. But as night fell in Phoenix, back in the U. S. A. Trump mounted the stage in prime time and quickly caught fire. He poured forth an hourlong harangue against all things alien, highlighting the lurid crimes of a handful of illegal immigrants as if to define the character of millions. He also promised to build ”a beautiful wall” across the entire U. S.  border and create a ”deportation task force” that would eventually guarantee that ”the bad ones are gone.” On the subject of the wall, Trump departed from his script to assure his listeners that Mexico would indeed pay for it  —   adding, ”They may not know it yet, but they will.” In so doing, he as much as acknowledged that Peña Nieto had told him something different earlier in the day. That was not a minor point, but rather a sore one. The issue of the wall's cost had taken over the news and Twitter feeds earlier in the evening. Trump himself had insisted at the news conference in Mexico City that the two men did not discuss the financing of the wall. Peña Nieto, who did not contradict Trump at the time (maintaining a striking deference to the American throughout their joint appearance) later tweeted that he had begun their meeting by saying Mexico would never pay for such a wall, a stance Mexican officials have taken consistently. None of the Trump surrogates appearing across the media landscape Wednesday night seemed to dispute this, saying rather that the Wednesday meeting had ”not been a negotiation” and that more formal talks would ensue on the wall and its financing. Rest assured, they seemed to say, Mexico will come around. Throughout the Phoenix speech, Trump read from a teleprompter but supercharged the script with his own asides and   many of which riled the already raucous crowd to transports of delight. At one moment, promising to rid the land of criminal immigrants, he shouted that ”in the first hour they are gone,” and the throng exulted. Trump in such moments would back away and himself applaud until the roar subsided. Listening to the speech, marveling at the   maneuver, one could almost hear the spirited debate within the councils of Trump's campaign. One imagined Kellyanne Conway, the    manager, arguing for the quickie trip to Mexico and the confab with Peña Nieto. Since stepping up in   she has been seen as a moderating influence, seeking a new tone and tenor more appealing to white suburban voters (especially women and college graduates). With Conway seeming to be ascendant, one could easily imagine the day ending with a very different speech in Phoenix. Would Trump not hail his conquest of Mexico City, citing his domination of the news conference where he practically had the Mexican president poised on his knee? Would Trump not repeat his lines of praise for ”first, second and   Mexican Americans” he said were ”beyond reproach” and even ”spectacular,   people”? The die seemed to be cast, and the timing seemed propitious. Because two weeks of adverse publicity about the ClintonFoundation and its donors and about newly discovered emails at the State Department have helped erode Clinton's already weak standing with voters. For the first time, her disapproval numbers were almost equal to Trump's. Conway seemed to have found just the right moment to raise her candidate's acceptability score in contrast with his opponent. But if this was the opportunity for a turnaround that changed the broad public perception of Trump, it was a moment not only missed but thrust away with both hands. For as soon as that moderating narrative got airborne, Trump's speech in Phoenix took off after it with the speed and fury of an   missile. The explosion as the two met in midair against the desert sky was spectacular indeed. That intercept was launched, in all likelihood, from the campaign's other new major domo, Steve Bannon, the former publisher of Breitbart. com, the   voice of the   movement. Bannon, now called the CEO of the Trump campaign, has been a fan of the   approach on immigration as well as other issues. And whether he or another wordsmith in the Trump camp wrote the script, it was the fuel for one of the candidate's most incendiary performances. In the speech, Trump not only doubled down on the wall and the invoice to Mexico, but on a ”deportation task force” that would either drive the undocumented out of the country of their own accord or arrest them and send them to their countries of origin. The ”softening” often promised in recent days seemed to consist only in the delay of the deportation endeavor until the wall could be completed and all the criminal elements of the illegal population first removed. Trump made a point of including in his ban the ”dreamers,” present in the U. S. now as adults because they were brought to the country as minor children by their parents. This has been an especially popular target group for immigration reformers, and Obama protected them from deportation orders with one of his executive actions. At some point, Trump allowed, ”we will bring back the good ones.” But moments after making this concession to what he has called ”being humane about it,” Trump was filling the stage with the grieving parents of people killed by immigrants in the country illegally. After a day spent putting his weight down on one foot, the Republican nominee was standing firm on the other. And he left little doubt where he would remain through the rest of this campaign.",False,"Trump has provided the political world with many moving moments over the past year, but none quite like the whiplash mood swing between his daytime and nighttime performances in Mexico City and Phoenix on Wednesday.

None of the Trump surrogates appearing across the media landscape Wednesday night seemed to dispute this, saying rather that the Wednesday meeting had not been a negotiation and that more formal talks would ensue on the wall and its financing. Rest assured, they seemed to say, Mexico will come around. Throughout the Phoenix speech, Trump read from a teleprompter but supercharged the script with his own asides and   many of which riled the already raucous crowd to transports of delight. At one moment, promising to rid the land of criminal immigrants, he shouted that in the first hour they are gone, and the throng exulted. Trump in such moments would back away and himself applaud until the roar subsided. Listening to the speech, marveling at the   maneuver, one could almost hear the spirited debate within the councils of Trump's campaign. One imagined Kellyanne Conway, the    manager, arguing for the quickie trip to Mexico and the confab with Pea Nieto. Since stepping up in   she has been seen as a moderating influence, seeking a new tone and tenor more appealing to white suburban voters (especially women and college graduates). With Conway seeming to be ascendant, one could easily imagine the day ending with a very different speech in Phoenix. Would Trump not hail his conquest of Mexico City, citing his domination of the news conference where he practically had the Mexican president poised on his knee? Would Trump not repeat his lines of praise for first, second and   Mexican Americans he said were beyond reproach and even spectacular,   people? The die seemed to be cast, and the timing seemed propitious. Because two weeks of adverse publicity about the ClintonFoundation and its donors and about newly discovered emails at the State Department have helped erode Clinton's already weak standing with voters. For the first time, her disapproval numbers were almost equal to Trump's. Conway seemed to have found just the right moment to raise her candidate's acceptability score in contrast with his opponent. But if this was the opportunity for a turnaround that changed the broad public perception of Trump, it was a moment not only missed but thrust away with both hands. For as soon as that moderating narrative got airborne, Trump's speech in Phoenix took off after it with the speed and fury of an   missile. The explosion as the two met in midair against the desert sky was spectacular indeed. That intercept was launched, in all likelihood, from the campaign's other new major domo, Steve Bannon, the former publisher of Breitbart. com, the   voice of the   movement. Bannon, now called the CEO of the Trump campaign, has been a fan of the   approach on immigration as well as other issues. And whether he or another wordsmith in the Trump camp wrote the script, it was the fuel for one of the candidate's most incendiary performances. In the speech, Trump not only doubled down on the wall and the invoice to Mexico, but on a deportation task force that would either drive the undocumented out of the country of their own accord or arrest them and send them to their countries of origin. The softening often promised in recent days seemed to consist only in the delay of the deportation endeavor until the wall could be completed and all the criminal elements of the illegal population first removed. Trump made a point of including in his ban the dreamers, present in the U. S. now as adults because they were brought to the country as minor children by their parents. This has been an especially popular target group for immigration reformers, and Obama protected them from deportation orders with one of his executive actions. At some point, Trump allowed, we will bring back the good ones. But moments after making this concession to what he has called being humane about it, Trump was filling the stage with the grieving parents of people killed by immigrants in the country illegally. After a day spent putting his weight down on one foot, the Republican nominee was standing firm on the other. And he left little doubt where he would remain through the rest of this campaign."

Venezuela's economy is in freefall. Food shortages have left grocery stores bare, while medicine shortages have frustrated doctors who say they have a fraction of the supplies that they need. Inflation is rampant, lootings and riots are common and blackouts are frequent, as John Otis has been reporting for NPR for months. All this, in the country with the world's largest oil reserves. Maduro's approval ratings have plummeted, but as NPR's Lulu   has reported, the socialist leader is holding firmly to his power. His government ”controls the judiciary, the military, the executive and most of the media in the country,” Lulu notes. And some public servants believe they have been fired as retribution for supporting a recall vote. ”Venezuela's government says it is the victim of an economic war that has crippled its economy,” Lulu says. ”It alleges the opposition is in the pay of the U. S. government, which is intent on overthrowing it. The opposition and the U. S. both deny this charge.” Military and police forces were deployed across the city ahead of Thursday's march, as Maduro accused the march organizers of planning a coup. Opposition leaders, who were hoping 1 million people would show up to the protest, say they are hoping to put enough political pressure on the government to push a recall vote to happen this year. Maduro, speaking at a counterprotest in support of the government, mocked the turnout as being far lower than expected  —   he pegged it at 30, 000, while organizers said it was much higher, The Associated Press reports. Otis explained what's at stake: ”Should Maduro lose, new elections would be held  —   and the opposition would stand a good chance of returning to power for the first time since the late Hugo Chavez ushered in Venezuela's socialist revolution in 1999. ”Critics claim the government is stalling for time. The country's electoral council, which nearly always sides with the executive branch, says there may not be enough time to gather signatures and organize the voting process to hold the recall this year, and that the vote very likely will have to be held in 2017. ”Should that happen, and Maduro loses, his vice president would take over  —   keeping the ruling socialists in power until at least 2019.” Among the marchers, The Associated Press reports, were about 100 indigenous people  —   from the Piaroa and Jiwi tribes  —   who traveled from the Amazon to protest. A member of the Piaroa tribe was accused of fraud and jailed last year during elections, ”a case the government used to disqualify three indigenous leaders from taking seats in the   legislature,” the news service writes. The protesters have vowed another show of force next Wednesday. Otis, who frequently reports from Venezuela for NPR, tried to travel to Caracas to cover the protest for us. But he was blocked at the border  —   the government was turning away foreign reporters. He wrote about the experience Wednesday night: ”Apparently the government thinks it can control or tamp down news coverage of Thursday's protest by keeping out foreign reporters. But international news organizations like CNN, AP, Reuters and Bloomberg News all have permanent correspondents here, so it's not like proceedings will go unnoticed. ”What's more, sending us packing only reinforces the government's   reputation with the press.

But Camila also noted that some experts were warning the signal might be merely interference, and possibly military in origin  —   and it now seems that that's the case. The signal was detected in 2015 by Russian astronomers using the   radio telescope in Zelenchukskaya, at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains north of Georgia.

And now, according to Bloomberg, the company is rolling out G Organic  —   yep, an organic version of the famously technicolored sports drink Gatorade. (Think crimson red, electric blue and neon green shades.) ”Gatorade really dominates the [sports drink] market right now,” says Beth Bloom, senior food and drink analyst at the market research firm Mintel. Gatorade commands 77 percent of sports drink sales in the U. S. ”I think the [organic line] will broaden the appeal,” says Bloom. G Organic will be ”one additional offering in their line that may [offer] a little bit of a better health profile.” Bloom says health is definitely a driver in the purchase of organic products: ”We're seeing that about half of consumers who purchase organic products do so because they think they're healthier than   products.” But is this new line of organic Gatorade really any better for you? I put the question to Haemi Choi, a sports medicine doctor at Loyola University Medical Center. She says some consumers like to see artificial colors and flavors removed from products. ”It's more natural,” Choi says. ”But I don't think it's healthier per se. It's pretty similar,” she says. Take, for instance, the sugar content. Even though Gatorade seems to have switched to an organic cane sugar for its new organic line, Choi says that, nutritionally, this makes little difference. (We asked Gatorade to confirm the ingredient list of the new organic line, but did not hear back in time for press.) Overall, Choi says the new organic line seems to contain about the same amount of sugar  —   about 20 grams per   bottle. At a time we're told to cut back on sugar, she notes that many of us are already getting too much in our diet. ”The average American consumes about 350 added calories from sugar [each day].” For instance, women are told to limit consumption to somewhere between 25 and 37 grams of sugar per day, total. ”So, drinking a bottle of [sports drink] is already getting you close to what you should get in one day,” Choi says. Choi says unless you're exercising vigorously for an hour or longer and sweating a lot, you don't need to drink any kind of sports drinks  —   organic or not. If you're out for a casual jog or bike ride, you don't need electrolyte replacement, either. So, what does Choi recommend for quenching thirst? ”I say, drink water,” she says. Lots of dieticians agree. ”Sugar is sugar, so no matter if it's organic or not, it's still going to have the same effect on your body,” says Lisa Cimperman, a clinical dietician and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. If you consume too much, it may have negative effects on your waistline and can increase   levels. And as we've reported, excess sugar is also linked to a higher risk of heart disease. Cimperman says the new organic label may lead consumers to think organic Gatorade is healthier for them. ”I think it's a marketing ploy to apply this organic health halo to this product,” Cimperman says. And that halo will likely cost you more.

This is a source of great pride to us with roots in that city. But when I went to the U. S. I realized quickly that nobody had heard of literary giant Rabindranath Tagore or physicist C. V. Raman. Even economist Amartya Sen was not that  . But everyone knew of Mother Teresa. When Americans learned I was born in the city, the first thing they'd usually ask is: ”Have you ever met Mother Teresa?” As a matter of fact, I had seen her. And like many in Kolkata, I have mixed feelings about her relationship with our city. I went to a   missionary school in Kolkata in the 1980s. We   boys did not have to go to catechism classes, but as part of our ”social service” we routinely went to her homes for the destitute with packets of milk powder, biscuits and old clothes. We were young and Mother Teresa, then in her 70s, already seemed impossibly old and hunched, her wrinkled face a startling contrast to the crisp pleats of her    saris. We admired her because she did what we did not have the stomach for  —   tending to men and women whose limbs were stunted by leprosy, looking after children with lesions, comforting the dying. I came from a   family that insulated me from all of that. We looked away when the beggar without hands knocked on the car window with his stumps wrapped in grubby bandages. Mother Teresa did not just look that beggar in the eye. She embraced him. Her devotion to my city, where she lived from the 1930s until her death in 1997, could not be questioned, and I was not one of those who only saw her foreignness.   Mother Teresa was an integral part of my city she was as much a Kolkatan as I was. But she did not define my city for me. She was part of the patchwork that made up Kolkata along with its artists, its filmmakers, its politicians, its cricketers. Only when I went to America as a student did it start feeling as if my city had somehow become Mother Teresa City and nothing more. I would always feel uneasy, almost guilty, when I met those volunteers who had been to Kolkata. For them it was their hardship posting and a place of  . For me it was just home. It made me wonder how I could take pride in a woman whose life's work was at its essence all about the failures of my city. Those sick, those poor, those dying, those diseased were all the people who had been abandoned by my city, spurned by their government, failed by their social service organizations. Pride in her Nobel made me a little queasy. This is not to pretend that the suffering underbelly that Mother Teresa exposed was not real. Not at all. But there was another Kolkata as well  —   a city of coffeehouses and bookstores a city of great political fervor and artistic ferment a city with Swiss patisseries, Jewish bakeries and Bengali sweet shops a city with its own triumphs and tribulations  —   and that city was lost in her overwhelming aura. Mother Teresa died while I was in America, but the Kolkata she left in the global imagination remained my cross to bear. This image of Kolkata was not concocted by Mother Teresa. In 1756, more than 140 British soldiers and civilians were imprisoned by the local nawab of Bengal in a small dungeon in a fort in Kolkata. One hundred   died of suffocation and heat exhaustion. That tragedy gave birth to the phrase ”Black Hole of Calcutta,” an image the city never shook off. In Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night a character says, ”Can't expect us to live in the Black Hole of Calcutta.” Over two centuries later an Indian prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, raised the hackles of the city when he casually called it a ”dying city,” one that had fallen off the map of major airlines. Then along came Dominique Lapierre and his 1985 novel, City of Joy, which became a film that cemented that image of Kolkata as the helpless crucible of India's poverty waiting for a Patrick Swayze to come save it from itself. Kolkata, like many Indian cities, still grapples with poverty and economic uncertainty, but it's also one of India's more affordable and safer cities, no longer beset by power cuts and embarking on ambitious infrastructure projects. It's also the city with India's first subway system. Once the capital of the British Indian Empire, it has long been seen as a city in decline, racked by political unrest, beset by power cuts, abandoned by industry. Even its resident Bengalis have left in droves for opportunities elsewhere. Yet it's still a city that survives and rejoices and celebrates. We have drunk beer on its rooftops and sipped steaming cups of tea while sitting on its front porches. Mother Teresa followed her calling as we must each follow ours. But now as she becomes a saint, the world's media have come calling again to try to rediscover Mother Teresa's Kolkata. Many still go to her tomb with prayers and wishes written on chits of paper. Her Missionaries of Charity still run the homes she set up. And though critics wish they could have opened a     hospital with all the money her order received, the Missionaries of Charity have no intention to diversify. A part of me wants to think that now that she is officially a saint, she will be reclaimed by the Catholic Church as she should be. But as the state's chief minister inaugurates a   statue in the archbishop's house in the heart of the city and flies off to the Vatican to watch the beatification, as politicians demand rail stations and airports be named after her, I wonder if Kolkata can easily let its Mother Teresa go. As part of a recent beautification drive, the city authorities decided Kolkata's public structures, its bridges, overpasses, police stations, water tanks needed to have a uniform color scheme. Since the last few months that's been extended to the city's lights as well. The lampposts are draped in LEDs of the same color scheme. The colors happen to be blue and white  —   Mother Teresa colors. It's just coincidence, but at night as you land in my city for a moment you could be fooled into thinking you are entering the twinkling chapel of St. Teresa of Kolkata.

But there was another Kolkata as well     a city of coffeehouses and bookstores a city of great political fervor and artistic ferment a city with Swiss patisseries, Jewish bakeries and Bengali sweet shops a city with its own triumphs and tribulations     and that city was lost in her overwhelming aura. Mother Teresa died while I was in America, but the Kolkata she left in the global imagination remained my cross to bear. This image of Kolkata was not concocted by Mother Teresa. In 1756, more than 140 British soldiers and civilians were imprisoned by the local nawab of Bengal in a small dungeon in a fort in Kolkata. One hundred   died of suffocation and heat exhaustion. That tragedy gave birth to the phrase Black Hole of Calcutta, an image the city never shook off. In Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night a character says, Can't expect us to live in the Black Hole of Calcutta. Over two centuries later an Indian prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, raised the hackles of the city when he casually called it a dying city, one that had fallen off the map of major airlines. Then along came Dominique Lapierre and his 1985 novel, City of Joy, which became a film that cemented that image of Kolkata as the helpless crucible of India's poverty waiting for a Patrick Swayze to come save it from itself. Kolkata, like many Indian cities, still grapples with poverty and economic uncertainty, but it's also one of India's more affordable and safer cities, no longer beset by power cuts and embarking on ambitious infrastructure projects. It's also the city with India's first subway system. Once the capital of the British Indian Empire, it has long been seen as a city in decline, racked by political unrest, beset by power cuts, abandoned by industry. Even its resident Bengalis have left in droves for opportunities elsewhere. Yet it's still a city that survives and rejoices and celebrates. We have drunk beer on its rooftops and sipped steaming cups of tea while sitting on its front porches. Mother Teresa followed her calling as we must each follow ours. But now as she becomes a saint, the world's media have come calling again to try to rediscover Mother Teresa's Kolkata. Many still go to her tomb with prayers and wishes written on chits of paper. Her Missionaries of Charity still run the homes she set up. And though critics wish they could have opened a     hospital with all the money her order received, the Missionaries of Charity have no intention to diversify. A part of me wants to think that now that she is officially a saint, she will be reclaimed by the Catholic Church as she should be. But as the state's chief minister inaugurates a   statue in the archbishop's house in the heart of the city and flies off to the Vatican to watch the beatification, as politicians demand rail stations and airports be named after her, I wonder if Kolkata can easily let its Mother Teresa go. As part of a recent beautification drive, the city authorities decided Kolkata's public structures, its bridges, overpasses, police stations, water tanks needed to have a uniform color scheme. Since the last few months that's been extended to the city's lights as well. The lampposts are draped in LEDs of the same color scheme. The colors happen to be blue and white     Mother Teresa colors. It's just coincidence, but at night as you land in my city for a moment you could be fooled into thinking you are entering the twinkling chapel of St. Teresa of Kolkata. Sandip Roy is a writer living in Kolkata. He is a commentator for NPR and his first novel is Don't Let Him Know."

But They Can Be Political Weapons, Too",NPR,Carrie Johnson,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/492266302/trump-wants-a-special-prosecutor-for-clinton-but-they-can-be-political-weapons-t,"Republican presidential nominee Trump has been calling for a criminal investigation of his political opponent Clinton on the campaign trail this year. Trump is angry the FBI probe of Clinton's email server ended with no charges. Now, he says, an independent outsider needs to look at the ClintonFoundation. ”The Justice Department is required to appoint an independent special prosecutor because it has proven itself to be really, sadly, a political arm of the White House,” Trump said in Akron, Ohio, last week. Trump has offered no evidence to back up his claims that the Justice Department has been corrupted. But his call for a special prosecutor sounds familiar to people who study the intersection of law and politics. ”If you look at the chronology, pretty much the political party that does not control the White House tends to want special prosecutors and independent counsel laws,” said Ken Gormley, president of Duquesne University in Pittsburgh and the author of two books on special prosecutors. ”As soon as the party is in the White House, they don't want it anymore.” In modern times, the idea first cropped up during the 1970s. President Richard Nixon notoriously fired a special prosecutor who was getting close to the tapes that would bring down his administration. Five months after what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre, Congress started work on an independent counsel law. The idea was to insulate sensitive criminal investigations from meddling by the White House. The law would stand for about 20 years. It didn't produce many criminal convictions, but it did stir up a lot of trouble for presidents  —   and the people close to them. In 1996, Clinton became the first sitting first lady to testify before a grand jury. This one was investigating the Whitewater affair, an investigation that began with a real estate investment and morphed into scrutiny of President Bill Clinton's sexual improprieties. Clinton was never charged with wrongdoing, but the investigation left a mark. Years later, Gormley interviewed Bill Clinton about it. ”He made clear that his decision to allow and endorse the appointment of an independent counsel in the Whitewater matter was one of the biggest mistakes of his presidency,” Gormley said. ”In fact, the words he used at one point is that it was like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. And almost from the moment he was in the White House, there were political opponents using special prosecutors to bring him down, and they were off to the races.” By 1999, when Congress considered whether to renew the statute, opposition came from nearly all sides. Even Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr told Congress the law had become a political weapon. ”The statutory mechanism intended to enhance confidence in law enforcement had the effect of weakening it,” Starr said, in arguing the law should not be reauthorized. ”Jurisdiction and authority over these sensitive matters ought to be returned to the Justice Department. And who will oversee them? The Congress, the press, the public.” That's exactly what happened. The law expired. But the Justice Department can still use special prosecutors. They're career lawyers, protected from political leaders at Justice by a firewall. During the George W. Bush years, special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald charged and convicted a top aide to the vice president. Justice Department leaders went on to deploy special prosecutors to investigate the firings of U. S. attorneys and the destruction of videotapes that showed torture of detainees. But authorities have relied on those prosecutors only sparingly, a position adopted by many, including Gormley. ”I think I've come to the conclusion that we are better off when we have less of these investigations rather than more,” he said. ”They should be reserved for very special and extreme occasions.” Otherwise, Gormley argued, they could distract from what's really important. ”As we as a country were just obsessed with the issue of Whitewater, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky and all of these distractions during the 1990s, there were people inside and outside the country literally plotting our attack,” he said. One of them, Gormley said, was Osama bin Laden.",False,"Republican presidential nominee Trump has been calling for a criminal investigation of his political opponent Clinton on the campaign trail this year.

246,116594,172084,A Kitty Leads A Double Life In Beatrix Potter's Posthumously Published Tale ,NPR,Maureen Corrigan,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/492088474/a-kitty-leads-a-double-life-in-beatrix-potters-posthumously-published-tale,"This year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Beatrix Potter, one of the most enduring and cherished children's authors of all time. To commemorate the anniversary, a new,    story by Potter, called The Tale of Kitty in Boots, has been released. Readers, we've been down this road before, not too long ago, and it didn't end well. Atticus Finch's reputation took a hit after his exposure in Harper Lee's Go Set A Watchman as a segregationist and reactionary extremist. Do we really want to risk losing cherished illusions about the likes of Squirrel Nutkin and Jemima   in exchange for the novelty of a freshly unearthed tale by Beatrix Potter? Oh, but it's already too late for this question. As many of us learned in Potter's most famous story, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, once the garden of unknown delights beckons, it's all but impossible to resist entering in. Here's the backstory to this ”new” Beatrix Potter book: Two years ago, a woman named Jo Hanks who's an editor at Penguin Random House in the United Kingdom came upon a reference to a letter that Potter wrote in 1914. In that letter, Potter mentioned working on the manuscript of a story about ”a   prime black Kitty cat who leads a rather double life.” Hanks dug into Potter's archives at The Victoria  Albert Museum and she found the manuscript of The Tale of   . Potter had written three drafts of the story and had done one watercolor illustration of Kitty, but for various reasons, she died in 1943 without completing the book. Skip to the present and this lavish debut edition of The Tale of   . To use an antiquated phrase that Potter herself would have known, this edition is ”done up brown.” Quentin Blake, best known for his work on Roald Dahl's books, has created the illustrations and, on an audio CD included with the book, Helen Mirren reads the story. Ironically, such glitzy trappings make for a disconcerting Potter reading experience. After all, the charm of Potter's tales emanates, in part, from their humility  —   the signature compactness of her books and animal characters. Add to that, the fact that Blake's style as an illustrator is jittery and impressionistic, in contrast to Potter's fluid precision. His illustrations end up emphasizing, rather than countering, the violence that lurks in even the most amiable Potter tale. That ominous tone is set in the very first story when Peter Rabbit's mother gives him and his sisters  —   Flopsy, Mopsy and    —   a warning: ”Now, my dears,” said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, ”you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.” In its own quaint way, Potter's landscape is every bit as Gothic as the Brontes'. And, sometimes, as in The Tale of    Potter's stories are nearly as surreal as Lewis Carroll's. The ”Kitty” in question here calls herself ”Miss Catherine St. Quintin,” and she does, indeed, lead a double life. By day she's the docile pet of a kind old lady by night she's a poacher who prowls the countryside armed with an   and dressed in ”a gentleman's Norfolk jacket, and little   boots.” Kitty is such a convincing gender nonconformist that she's mistaken for ”a sportsman” by Mrs.   the   from an earlier tale. Other recognizable furry faces include fellow feline Tabitha Twitchit, Mr. Tod the creepy fox and a much older Peter Rabbit, described as ”stout” and ”very fat.” Rest assured, this is the closest we come here to that dread Atticus Finch moment in which a beloved character is changed for the worse. Newly discovered manuscripts by revered authors hold out the promise of familiar, yet fresh, literary magic in truth, though, The Tale of    is just a curious afterword to the 24 children's books Potter completed in her lifetime. Perhaps the best thing about this ”new” story is that it will send some readers back to the originals and to the life of the extraordinary woman who wrote them. Potter was a naturalist, fascinated by fungi she was a shrewd businesswoman, who patented an early ”Peter Rabbit” doll and other   merchandise and she was an environmentalist, responsible for the preservation of much of The Lake District in England. Potter's tales sprang from her deep appreciation of all creatures slight and small, but  —   as a woman and a writer  —   she was a smart, tough cookie certainly no Mrs.  .",False,"This year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Beatrix Potter, one of the most enduring and cherished children's authors of all time.

Brown announced he is ending his   career as a member of his city's police force. Brown is perhaps best known for leading his department in the aftermath of the slaying of five Dallas police officers by a disgruntled war veteran on July 7. ”Let's always remember the fallen officers including the five officers on July 7, 2016, and the brave men and women of the Dallas Police Department for their sacrifices to keep Dallas safe. Their memory will remain with all of us forever,” Brown said. ”I know the people of Dallas will never forget the ultimate sacrifice they made on the streets of our city that awful night.” Brown gave no reason for his decision, saying he will be unavailable until Sept. 8, when he will hold a news conference. He said his retirement will be effective Oct. 22. As member station KERA reports, Brown joined the Dallas force in 1983 as a patrol officer and had moved up the ranks. His tenure as police chief has been mixed. With violent crime surging in Dallas earlier this year, Brown tried to reassign hundreds of officers to   neighborhoods and move more personnel to the 4 p. m. to midnight shift. That move prompted a backlash among the rank and file, and one police union called for his resignation. But Brown's public image changed in July when he projected steady and sensitive leadership of his   department at its darkest period. Chief Brown called the slain officers ”guardians” of democracy who died protecting the freedom of   protesters. Obama praised his leadership. In the aftermath of the killings, Brown cracked down on protesters. In his statement, Brown thanked his officers. ”Your extraordinary service will forever be etched in my heart and will serve as a guidepost for me in the next phase of my life,” he said. ”You will always be in my prayers.”",False,"In a brief and surprising statement, Dallas Police Chief David O.

248,116596,172086,Can Cute Virtual Reality Spiders Help Reduce Arachnophobia?,NPR,Barbara J. King,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/09/01/491991386/can-cute-virtual-reality-spiders-help-reduce-arachnophobia,"Eight yellow garden spiders, also called writing spiders or Argiope aurantia, set up shop at various locations around the exterior of my house this summer. These strikingly large,    spiders were fascinating to watch: Remaining immobile for long periods, occasionally they would rapidly travel their web  —   unusually patterned with its zigzag of silk or ”writing” in the center  —   to collect and ”wrap up” a tiny prey animal. Luckily for me, one of the biggest spiders resided directly outside my study window, so I could observe all this from only a few inches away, through clear glass. It was that solid barrier between the spider and me that made me so brave. Arachnophobia, though, isn't the same as a little bit of unease around spiders: It can be a serious and sometimes debilitating fear. Itsy, a Samsung Nordic Virtual Reality app, is meant to help significantly reduce spider fear in three hours. Developed by William Hamilton and tested in cooperation with psychologists at Stockholm University, Itsy takes techniques borrowed from cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, transports them into a gamelike VR environment, and introduces viewers to animated spiders that slowly become more realistic. I tried VR for the first time last January at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, where I watched iAnimal, Animal Equality and Condition One's VR film about pig slaughter. By the film's conclusion, I was so moved as to be in tears. But Itsy, unlike iAnimal, constructs a fake world with spiders that are at the beginning dressed up and made cute: Does that matter for how people react? Hamilton, speaking in a video, says that even if the environment in a particular VR app is simulated, ”the emotional response is not.” Itsy was tested with four volunteers, one each from Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. In the video, Mette Marie Lei Lange from Denmark is shown first in a room with a tarantula in an exhibit case. Her fear is evident, and she says, ”I doubt that God exists if that thing does.” She adds, ”I don't understand it. It has too many legs.” I really liked the   humor in Lange's words and also her honesty. She knows that most spiders aren't dangerous (a point made vitally clear in the video) and she doesn't wish to pass on her arachnophobia to her two children. Her decision to try out the Itsy app was brave  —   given her phobia, I mean seriously brave, not the jokey ”brave” of my looking at a writing spider through my window. We can follow along in the   video, lasting around 12 minutes, to see for ourselves some of how Lange does before, during and after the VR experience. It's clear at the end that she felt helped: When she encounters the same   spider in the ”after” condition, she approaches much more closely, with a more relaxed body posture. I do have some constructive criticism. Given that Lange pinpoints her specific fear as rooted in the movements of spiders, shouldn't she, in the ”after” condition, encounter a spider that is moving, not just sitting immobile? And how do we know that the spider fear stays reduced for weeks and months after the   Itsy treatment? In an email message, Hamilton, through a third party, said that ”the effect will last as long as in a traditional treatment. We checked in with the test subjects and they are still relieved from their fear.” How long after, he didn't say. The Stockholm University study now underway, comparing the results of traditional CBT therapy using real spiders with VR therapy using animated spiders, will no doubt address that point. Though tamping down arachnophobia is Itsy's main aim, I love that another goal is to help spiders too: Fewer spiders may be killed in our homes once people become less afraid of them. (My house spiders get taken calmly or sometimes less calmly outdoors in   missions.) On Tuesday, as my husband and I did a final   census around the perimeter of our house, we spied what we're pretty sure is a spider egg sac hanging near our front   window.

249,116597,172087,Costa Rica Becomes A Magnet For Migrants,NPR,Carrie Kahn,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/09/01/492066728/costa-rica-becomes-a-magnet-for-migrants,"Costa Rica is best known for its vacation beaches and lush rain forests. But recently it has become a thoroughfare for tens of thousands of migrants from South America and elsewhere who are hoping to reach the U. S. Many are from the Caribbean, but a significant number trekking through the country are Africans and Southeast Asians, and collectively, they are straining Costa Rica's welcoming reputation. Migration officer Marvin Rodriguez is on the phone. He's getting word that authorities are sending two buses carrying 120 migrants that just crossed into Costa Rica on its southern border with Panama. It'll take about two hours for them to arrive at this newly erected migrant shelter where he's stationed, in the small town of Buenos Aires, just north of the border. ”We've never seen anything like this,” says Rodriguez. But this is becoming increasingly common in Costa Rica. Migrants from many countries, Late last year, thousands of Cubans came. They got stuck in Costa Rica when Nicaragua refused to let them continue northward. Then soon after came Haitians, Nigerians, Congolese, and even Kashmiris started coming. Authorities say about 150 migrants arrive every day, though only about 30 can sneak out daily into Nicaragua. That's left most migrants stranded at shelters. Migrants like Maria Joseph, who arrived eight days ago with her husband and two daughters. In broken Spanish, she says her family flew from the Congo to Brazil, then crossed several South American countries by bus, paying off border guards all along the way, then walked eight grueling days through the jungle between Colombia and Panama. ”In Panama these five guys with guns got us, and took everything. Clothes, cellphones, all our money,” says Joseph. ”In Costa Rica, they don't take from you,” she says. ”They just give.” Mayte Castro Santi smiles when she hears the migrants speak well of the Costa Ricans. She's one of several local residents cooking two meals a day, washing the bedsheets and handing out donated clothes. Stirring a huge pot of white rice, she says that ”since our grandparents' time, Costa Ricans have always greeted people as best as we can.” Lately though, that goodwill is being put to the test. In just the past four months, more than 6, 500 migrants have been registered entering Costa Rica's southern border. The majority have told officials they are from Congo. But most are believed to be Haitians who were living in Brazil and left when their construction jobs in the run up to the Olympics ended. With so many migrants coming through, authorities say even if they could determine nationalities, mass detention or deportation is not an option financially or morally. ”A humanitarian challenge” President Luis Guillermo Solis says his country will not criminalize migration. ”It has to be seen as a humanitarian challenge and this is how we like to think we are handling it,” he says. Solis spoke at the Wilson Center, a Washington, D. C. think tank, after a meeting last week with Obama and Vice President Biden. The U. S. ambassador to Costa Rica, S. Fitzgerald Haney, says Costa Rica is a model for the world on how to treat refugees. ”We very much appreciate and applaud the government of Costa Rica for everything they are doing, and where we can help we will,” he says. The U. S. sent tents for 2, 400 families and is helping migration officials reduce a backlog of asylum applications. The country is also dealing with a record number of Central Americans, especially from El Salvador, seeking refuge. Starting this month, the U. S. will work with Costa Rica to resettle some of those asylum seekers in the U. S. While the current work with migrants is admirable, University of Costa Rica social science professor Carlos Sandoval says the country has a mixed record on accepting immigrant groups and   resettlement. Nicaraguans, who arrived here during the tumultuous 1980s and '90s, still fill the lowest jobs in society and get blamed for nearly all social ills. ”Insecurity, lack of health provisions and the like . .. you just blame it on the Nicaraguans,” he says. ”It is very common, that kind of justification.” Sandoval worries the newest refugees may suffer the same outcome, especially since there's no sign their numbers are letting up. Carlos Granados lives next to one of Costa Rica's official migrant shelters and has grown tired of the endless traffic. ”It's great being good people, but there's a limit,” says Granados. ”We have a lot of our own poor people here . .. and they need help, too.”",False,"Costa Rica is best known for its vacation beaches and lush rain forests.

That's because it doesn't exist. But to be fair to Janus, most   remote islands aren't easy to find on maps either, unless you know what you're looking for. The gorgeous new period drama The Light Between Oceans does know what it's looking for. Set on the fictitious Janus, which lies some distance from the Australian coast, the film understands the romance and the mystique that arises from picturesque isolation. Literature's greatest names have long routed their heroes to islands, and the movie demonstrates the setting's great durability. It builds a gripping morality play, with characters as fierce and hardened as the choppy waves that crash onto the shore from all directions. The lighthouse keeper on this godforsaken paradise is Tom, played by Michael Fassbender with tight lips and a weary stare. He's a stoic World War I veteran with no family and a fat ton of survivor's remorse. These qualities would seem to make him the ideal candidate for such a solitary gig, but lighthouse keepers, we're told, fare better when they have companions to help tend to the chores. (The previous one had conjured images of his dead wife to keep him company.) So it's good for work when Tom quickly falls for Isabel (Alicia Vikander) the pretty young woman in the closest port town who's OK with the isolation  —   and the broken piano in the keeper's house  —   but desperately wants a family. Two heartbreaking miscarriages follow, with silent funerals as the island wind rattles the plain wooden crosses. The edge of the world seems to reject all attempts to populate it. An unexpected gift soon washes ashore. It would be foolish to give away too much of what follows this divine intervention, but don't believe the ads for this movie billing it as a mere romance. Readers of the novel by M. L. Stedman, from which the film is adapted, will know what sorts of decisions await Tom and Isabel, both out on Janus where only God is around to judge, and back in town where the repercussions will grow over the years. The story is airtight, with not an action or background detail wasted. As a grieving mother on the mainland (Rachel Weisz) begins to factor into things, a fascinating spiritual element takes shape: What is the just and righteous decision, and what is the   decision, and what if they are secretly the same? The skill of the leads is such that we can ask these questions without straying too far from the film itself. Any number of readings are possible in the performances of the   perfectly cast Fassbender and Vikander, who each depict their characters as withdrawn even when they're being intimate, and who can open up deep rifts in their relationship without saying a word. At one crucial moment, Vikander lets out a scream of such primal fury, a wail of possession, that it shatters the bones. It's a selfish, even childlike reaction to something she herself did wrong, yet we never think of Isabel as a cheat. She's human, and her wounds are deep, and she's chosen the wrong way to fill them. Director Derek Cianfrance previously made Blue Valentine, a   tale of love gone wrong, and The Place Beyond the Pines, a   crime saga. In the past, he has favored an intense, often furious brand of imagery that uses showy technique to approximate deep human emotion without ever quite arriving at real humanity. (Feel Ryan Gosling's pain! Feel it!) But here, Cianfrance has found material that complements him well, because the   story forces him to put his visual style to good use. He does wonders with closeups from behind, in   profile, setting the relationships between his leads   in subtle ways. And because setting your movie on an island is a waste if you can't bathe everything in natural light, he turns the film (shot on Tasmania and New Zealand) into   playtime. The Light Between Oceans drifts   in the ending, which drags on for one epilogue too many and operates under the ancient Hollywood sailor's mistaken belief that a touch of schmaltz cures all wounds.

251,116599,172089,FDA Fees On Industry Haven't Fixed Delays In Generic Drug Approvals,NPR,Sydney Lupkin,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/09/01/492235796/fda-fees-on-industry-havent-fixed-delays-in-generic-drug-approvals,"Consumers and lawmakers pushing for cheaper alternatives to the EpiPen, an antidote for   allergic reactions, and other   drugs are seeking answers about a stubborn backlog of generic drug applications at the Food and Drug Administration. Even after the agency started levying user fees on drugmakers in 2012 to pay for more people to review the medicines, the backlog of decisions still stretches almost four years. As of July 1, the FDA had 4, 036 generic drug applications awaiting approval, and the median time it takes for the FDA to approve a generic is now 47 months, according to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, a trade group. The FDA has approved more generics in the past few years, but a flood of applications has added to the problem. By comparison, the European Medicines Agency, Europe's version of the FDA, has just 24 generics, including biologically based biosimilars awaiting approval. The FDA's generic count doesn't include biosimilars, which are more complicated medicines to review. The EMA along with the European Commission, which handles approval of marketing materials, are approving generics and   drugs in about a year on average, according to the EMA. Critics say getting generic alternatives to the U. S. market for products like EpiPen is still taking far too long. Other   drugs with rising prices and no generic competition have also drawn scrutiny, including Turing Pharmaceuticals' Daraprim, for toxoplasmosis, and Valeant's cardiovascular drugs Isuprel and Nitropress. Congress asks why generic version of EpiPens aren't available  ”We are concerned that Mylan (maker of the EpiPen) has not faced much competition for its product,” five U. S. senators wrote Aug. 24 to FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf, adding that one of EpiPen's nongeneric competitors,   was recalled in October, granting Mylan a near monopoly. ”News reports indicate that generic versions of the EpiPen have been subject to additional questioning by the FDA and have yet to be approved.” On Monday, three members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce wrote a similar letter to the FDA, seeking information about the EpiPen generic applications it has received and how they've been prioritized. When asked whether the FDA bears any responsibility for the lack of EpiPen competition, FDA spokesman Kristofer Baumgartner said he couldn't comment on pending applications or confirm their existence, citing confidentiality rules. But he stressed that the FDA pushes pending applications for drugs with no current generics to the front of the line and approved 580 generics in 2015, a record for the agency and 40 percent more than in 2014. ”The FDA is confident that the overall trend in actions on generic drug applications will be one of continuing improvement,” Baumgartner said. In March, generics giant Teva Pharmaceuticals told investors that its generic version of EpiPen was rejected by the FDA, and that it wouldn't be able to launch the generic until at least 2017. Adamis Pharmaceuticals reported a similar rejection from the FDA for its EpiPen generic in June. Mylan has said it will offer a $300 generic in the coming weeks. Because Mylan also makes the   product, it won't have to wait in line behind other pending generics. Dr. James Baker, the CEO and chief medical officer of the advocacy group Food Allergy and Research Education, said Mylan's move may deter other generic manufacturers from seeking approval. Adrenaclick is the only other epinephrine   on the market, but it isn't an exact generic of EpiPen and can't be swapped automatically at the pharmacy if a doctor has written a prescription for EpiPen. Adrenaclick also isn't widely available. ”You call up 100 pharmacies, and maybe 10 have the device, from what we gather,” Baker said of Adrenaclick. He said several factors have allowed EpiPen's price tag to swell over the years. Many patients were in the dark about EpiPen price increases until insurers started shifting more of the cost onto consumers a few years ago, and getting approval for a generic that's both a drug and a device is more complicated than getting approval for a drug alone, he said. Meanwhile, Mylan has aggressively marketed its product and raised doubts about alternatives.  And documents show that Mylan submitted a citizen petition to the FDA arguing that people trained to use EpiPens wouldn't be able to use Teva's pending generic epinephrine   because of design differences. ”Is Mylan doing anything illegal? No,” Baker said. ”It's taking advantage of all these things to take the market and basically push it to an extreme.” User fees levied to speed up the approval process, The FDA's generic backlog isn't a new problem. In 2012, it was so large that it prompted the government to start charging user fees to generic manufacturers to provide the funds for the FDA to speed the process. The fees built on the    Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which required   drugmakers to pay fees to expand FDA's capacity to review applications for those medicines. In the first three years, the FDA collected $1 billion from generic drug manufacturers. The fees were used to hire an additional 1, 000 employees, and put the Office of Generic Drugs on par with the Office of New Drugs by reorganizing it and moving it from four outlying buildings to the FDA's main campus in Silver Spring, Md. The funds were also used to upgrade the office's information technology. The FDA says on its website: ”Additional resources will enable the Agency to reduce a current backlog of pending applications, cut the average time required to review generic drug applications for safety, and increase   inspections.” In October 2012, there was a backlog of 2, 868 generic drugs awaiting approval, and the FDA said it would take a ”first action” on 90 percent of these drugs by 2017. This summer, the agency met its goal a year early, but a first action isn't an approval. Instead, it stops the review clock and puts the applications back in industry's court. Only 1, 551 generics have been approved since the fees on drugmakers were initiated, and that total includes some extra applications that weren't considered part of the official backlog. So, all told, the agency has only approved about half of the backlogged generics that were awaiting approval in 2012. ”Most applications from the backlog will need to come back to FDA for additional review due to deficiencies in the submissions, before approval is possible,” the agency said in a statement in responses to questions. David Gaugh, senior vice president for science and regulatory affairs at the Generic Pharmaceuticals Association, said standards used to compile generic applications when they were submitted three or four years ago have changed while the applications were sitting in the backlog. So when the FDA got back to those companies, it said the applications were of ”poor quality.” The applications for generic drugs have continued to pile up even as the FDA approved a record number of generics in 2015 and again in the first seven months of 2016. The number of generic drug applications tripled from 2002 to 2012, according to January congressional testimony  from Janet Woodcock, who directs the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Still, some see signs the agency is on the right track. ”I think that it is an optimistic picture overall . .. at the FDA, there's been a lot of progress, and I think there is more to be made,” said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, an interdisciplinary drug researcher at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. ”This is not something that people should think has been solved at this point. It's totally an ongoing process.” Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.

At just    Schuble is short for a cyclist, but she has explosive power. She displays no outward signs of a disability at first glance. Schuble, who lives and trains in Birmingham, Ala. grew up playing soccer and running track. Then a series of accidents beginning in 1997 changed her life. It started when Schuble attended the U. S. Military Academy at West Point. ”I was in a hand to hand combat class and I did a flip and landed on my head,” she said. ”I ended up with a concussion [and] my neck had four partially bulged discs.” That's when she suffered her first traumatic brain injury, or TBI. She began to struggle  —   both academically and physically  —   and withdrew from West Point. A few years later, Schuble was in a car accident that resulted in a second TBI. Then in 2004, doctors diagnosed her with multiple sclerosis. At that point, she said, ”What next?”  Schuble says her biggest physical ailments are because of MS. ”MS is like an old house ” she said. ”So when your core body temperature gets hotter as in when you're exercising . .. you start misfiring. Your brain stops communicating. So, as an athlete that makes it harder.” When her body temperature rises she loses feeling in her feet, which makes running almost impossible. But on a bike, her feet lock into the pedals and her legs do the work. Schuble says cycling helps to keep her MS at bay and she constantly pushes the limits despite her disability. Paralympic athletes are divided into groups based on physical ability. Schuble competes with athletes who have mild physical impairments. Back in 2008, she came out of nowhere to break the world record in the women's 500 meters in Beijing. ”That was just a huge moment because I don't think anyone in that arena thought I'd win the 500 and break the world record,” said Schuble. ”And for me to actually pull that off and actually do the start that I did, it was huge.” She came close to winning gold again in London in 2012, but had to settle for an individual silver and a team bronze.

Jesuit priests connected to the private Catholic university sold 272 enslaved people in 1838, to pay off the university's massive debts. The men, women and children were sold to plantations in Louisiana the university received the equivalent of $3. 3 million, securing its survival. A working group, created last year to explore Georgetown's historical ties to slavery, says even more slaves might have been sold in the 1830s to keep the school afloat. And the school's connection to slavery is both broader and deeper than the one   sale. Georgetown was supported by the plantations of Jesuit priests in Maryland hundreds of people were enslaved by those Jesuits. An ”unknown number” of other enslaved people worked in or for the school, the working group says. In their report, made public Thursday, the working group says much more research is needed to fill in gaps in the historical record. They also call for a formal apology from the university for the school's ”historical relationship with slavery.” And, the report suggests, the school should give descendants of people owned by the Maryland Jesuits ”an advantage in the admissions process.” On Thursday, the university announced it would be doing just that  —   specifically, by treating the descendants of those enslaved people the same way it treats legacy students, applicants whose family members attended Georgetown. The working group had also recommended that Georgetown explore the feasibility of offering financial assistance for those students as well. The university did not mention scholarships or financial aid for descendants of the enslaved. Additionally, the school will be renaming two buildings  —   formerly named after the two university presidents who made the arrangements to sell slaves to fund the school. The buildings had been temporarily renamed to Freedom Hall and Memorial Hall while waiting for their final names. One will become Isaac Hall, after one of the enslaved men who was sold in 1838, and another Anne Marie Becraft Hall, after a black educator and nun. ”We hope that the two buildings will stand as a reminder of how our University community disregarded the high values of human dignity and education when it came to the plight of enslaved and free African Americans in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,” the working group wrote in its report. Georgetown will also establish a memorial to the people whose enslavement funded and built the school, offer a mass of reconciliation and work to promote scholarship in the field of racial justice, it says. Universities across the country have recently been grappling with their historical ties to slavery and slaveowners  —   along with the contemporary problems of racism and racial inequity, frequently the subject of campus protests. But Georgetown's step, to consider the enslavement of ancestors as part of the admissions process, may be unprecedented, The NY Times reports. The Times  —   which published a lengthy report on Georgetown's legacy of slavery this spring  —   spoke to a historian named Craig Steven Wilder who said he knew of no other school that had offered that kind of preferential admission status. Wilder also cautioned, the Times reports, ”that the significance of such a gesture would rest heavily on the degree to which Georgetown invested in outreach to descendants, including identifying them, making sure they are aware of the benefit's existence and actively recruiting them to the university.” Georgetown says that it will ”deepen archival resources to support genealogical work” and establish a new institute to research slavery and engage with descendants. The Georgetown Memory Project, an independent group, is currently working to identify descendants of those sold in 1838 to fund Georgetown. Richard Cellini, the founder of that project, told the student newspaper at Georgetown, that statistical models suggest up to 12, 000 to 15, 000 descendants may be living.

255,116603,172093,How GMOs Cut The Use Of Pesticides — And Perhaps Boosted It Again,NPR,Dan Charles,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/09/01/492091546/how-gmos-cut-the-use-of-pesticides-and-perhaps-boosted-them-again,"In the ferocious, sprawling brawl over genetically modified crops, one particular question seems like it should have a simple factual answer: Did those crops lead to more use of pesticides, or less? Sadly, there's no simple answer. Pesticides include both insecticides and herbicides. Backers of GMOs point to the example of crops containing new genes that fight off insect pests, so farmers don't have to spray insecticides. Biotech critics point to the example of crops that have been altered to tolerate specific weedkillers, like glyphosate, thus encouraging farmers to rely more heavily on those herbicides. This week, scientists at Iowa State made a fresh attempt to answer this question. It's based on the most detailed data ever assembled to examine the issue. Those data came from a private company, which gathered information about the farm practices of 5, 000 randomly selected farmers who grew corn and soybeans, the two most widely planted crops in the country. That information allowed detailed comparisons of pesticide use on fields planted with GMO corn and soybeans, compared to   fields. Unfortunately, this study probably won't settle the debate. It's that complicated. One of the study's conclusions is straightforward and difficult to dispute. Genetically modified,   corn has allowed farmers to reduce their use of insecticides to fight the corn rootworm and the European corn borer. There is, however, concern that this effect won't last. Corn rootworms have evolved resistance to one of the genes that has been deployed against them. When it comes to weedkillers, though, the picture gets more murky. For one thing, the effect of GMOs has been different in corn than in soybeans. Farmers who switched to   corn also switched herbicides, and used less total herbicide than farmers did on conventional corn  —   for a while. In the years since 2007, however,   corn got sprayed with more weedkillers, as measured in kilograms per acre, than corn without that GMO trait. Farmers who are growing genetically modified,   soybeans, meanwhile, have been using more weedkillers than their   neighbors. In fact, that gap has been widening in recent years. Edward Perry of Kansas State University, a   of the new study, which appears in the journal Science Advances, says farmers may be using more herbicides on   crops in recent years because they have to fight off an increasing number of weeds that have evolved to become resistant to glyphosate. Complicating the picture, however, is the fact that the war on weeds involves many different herbicides, and they vary tremendously in their environmental effects. The new study tries to account for that by comparing the ”environmental impact quotient,” or EIQ, of the herbicides sprayed on each field, in addition to their weight. But Andrew Kniss, a weed scientist at the University of Wyoming, says the EIQ falls woefully short as a measure of real environmental impact. ”Toxicity can vary by a factor of 10 or a hundred,” he says. The EIQ doesn't come anywhere close to capturing those large differences among chemicals, he says. Much better, he says, is a ”risk quotient” measure that's used by the EPA. ”It is, frankly, disappointing to see continued use of the EIQ in the   literature,” Kniss wrote in an email to The Salt. Kniss says the EIQ is such a crude measure that this study can't convincingly show whether GMO crops have been helpful or harmful to the environment.

258,116606,172096,One Result Of China's Buildup In South China Sea: Environmental Havoc,NPR,Jackie Northam,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/09/01/491395715/one-result-of-chinas-buildup-in-south-china-sea-environmental-havoc,"Just over a month ago, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague issued two important rulings. One soundly rejected Beijing's extensive claim of sovereignty in the South China Sea. The other focused on whether China had caused environmental damage as it constructed artificial islands in the region to help prop up its claim. The South China Sea's disputed waters are claimed by seven countries, and The Hague rulings came in response to a case brought against China by the Philippines. China dismissed The Hague's decision as ”nothing but a scrap of paper.” But Kent Carpenter, a professor of biological science at Old Dominion University and an expert witness for the tribunal, says The Hague tribunal's findings were nothing short of damning. ”The tribunal clearly decided that China had caused severe harm to the coral reef environment,” he says. China also violated its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ”to preserve and protect fragile ” he says. The tribunal found that damage to the coral reefs in the Spratly Islands is extensive, spreading for more than 30 square miles. Much of that damage is caused by China's    —   turning pristine reefs into permanent military outposts that include massive runways. John McManus, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Miami, says the Chinese use huge dredgers to pull up sand and anything else in their way. ”They're using a grinding ball,” he says. ”It's got grooves and teeth and it spins around and tears up living coral and parts of the coral reef substrate, to make more gravel and sand to be sucked up and used for  .” The dredgers also create plumes of sediment, McManus says. When it lands, the sediment smothers coral, fish, whole marine ecosystems. He says this has been devastating to one of the world's most biodiverse regions. ”We're talking about some of the highest diversity in the world,” he says. ”You may have 70 species of coral, roughly, in the Caribbean, about 70 or so in Hawaii  —   but here, we're talking well over 400 species of coral. And it's the same ratios for fish and invertebrates.” However destructive the   is, it's nothing compared to the damage done by the poaching of giant clams, says Carpenter. Chinese fishermen have been destroying entire reefs, he says, by using propellers to try to dredge up and harvest the clams, which appear on the IUCN Red List as a ”vulnerable” species. The fishers anchor a boat, rev up the engine and swing the propeller from side to side, he says. ”The action of the propeller basically uncovers and breaks up all of the coral, so that the giant clams are basically easy to extract,” he says. Carpenter says The Hague tribunal found the Chinese government had essentially turned a blind eye to the poaching of giant clams. The poachers' actions help China back up its claim that it's only building artificial islands on dead coral reefs, not living ones, McManus says. ”So in a way,” he says, ”China is not lying, they're telling the truth. They actually built on dead coral  —   because the Chinese fishers had already killed the coral.” Beijing has recently started cracking down on the poachers, he says. But Edgardo Gomez, a marine biologist at the University of the Philippines, says it may be too late. ”There are    species of giant clams in the world that are within that area,” he says, ”and all of the living clams plus the shells have been virtually wiped out of the South China Sea.” The Philippines tried restocking, but the clams were wiped out again. China was invited to  —   but did not  —   provide evidence to The Hague tribunal to back up its claims that it had done extensive environmental studies before constructing islands in the South China Sea. Carpenter says there's concern China will continue to build up islands and destroy the environment. ”If it does, then it will begin to lose all of its credibility with regard to its own international obligations,” he says. Even if China were to abandon the artificial islands, he warns, the environment in the area could take decades  —   if ever  —   to recover. Tearing down the islands at this point, he says, isn't the answer, either, and would cause more damage than has already been done.",False,"Just over a month ago, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague issued two important rulings.

China dismissed The Hague's decision as nothing but a scrap of paper. But Kent Carpenter, a professor of biological science at Old Dominion University and an expert witness for the tribunal, says The Hague tribunal's findings were nothing short of damning. The tribunal clearly decided that China had caused severe harm to the coral reef environment, he says. China also violated its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to preserve and protect fragile  he says. The tribunal found that damage to the coral reefs in the Spratly Islands is extensive, spreading for more than 30 square miles. Much of that damage is caused by China's       turning pristine reefs into permanent military outposts that include massive runways. John McManus, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Miami, says the Chinese use huge dredgers to pull up sand and anything else in their way. They're using a grinding ball, he says. It's got grooves and teeth and it spins around and tears up living coral and parts of the coral reef substrate, to make more gravel and sand to be sucked up and used for  . The dredgers also create plumes of sediment, McManus says. When it lands, the sediment smothers coral, fish, whole marine ecosystems. He says this has been devastating to one of the world's most biodiverse regions. We're talking about some of the highest diversity in the world, he says. You may have 70 species of coral, roughly, in the Caribbean, about 70 or so in Hawaii     but here, we're talking well over 400 species of coral. And it's the same ratios for fish and invertebrates. However destructive the   is, it's nothing compared to the damage done by the poaching of giant clams, says Carpenter. Chinese fishermen have been destroying entire reefs, he says, by using propellers to try to dredge up and harvest the clams, which appear on the IUCN Red List as a vulnerable species. The fishers anchor a boat, rev up the engine and swing the propeller from side to side, he says. The action of the propeller basically uncovers and breaks up all of the coral, so that the giant clams are basically easy to extract, he says. Carpenter says The Hague tribunal found the Chinese government had essentially turned a blind eye to the poaching of giant clams. The poachers' actions help China back up its claim that it's only building artificial islands on dead coral reefs, not living ones, McManus says. So in a way, he says, China is not lying, they're telling the truth. They actually built on dead coral     because the Chinese fishers had already killed the coral. Beijing has recently started cracking down on the poachers, he says. But Edgardo Gomez, a marine biologist at the University of the Philippines, says it may be too late. There are    species of giant clams in the world that are within that area, he says, and all of the living clams plus the shells have been virtually wiped out of the South China Sea. The Philippines tried restocking, but the clams were wiped out again. China was invited to     but did not     provide evidence to The Hague tribunal to back up its claims that it had done extensive environmental studies before constructing islands in the South China Sea. Carpenter says there's concern China will continue to build up islands and destroy the environment. If it does, then it will begin to lose all of its credibility with regard to its own international obligations, he says. Even if China were to abandon the artificial islands, he warns, the environment in the area could take decades     if ever     to recover. Tearing down the islands at this point, he says, isn't the answer, either, and would cause more damage than has already been done."

Just Ask HGTV,NPR,Kristofor Husted,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/09/01/492117376/your-dilapidated-barn-is-super-trendy-just-ask-hgtv,"Larry Gerdes is having his barn taken down and disassembled in Malta Bend, Mo. It's about the size of a   garage but stands much taller in a clearing surrounded by   stalks of corn. The barn's exterior is graying, part of its roof is missing, and there's a gaping hole looking out from the hayloft. It's about 100 years old, and it's not really useful. ”It's deteriorated and it would cost a lot of money to repair it,” Gerdes says. ”And it doesn't fit into modern farming. Unless you got two cows to let them loaf inside, nothing fits, and it's just obsolete.” While a quaint wooden barn lost in a field of greening corn is a classic farm country tableau, for modern farmers, many of these aging barns have lost their purpose. The barns can't fit today's giant tractors and are too small to house the larger herds of cattle or hogs. While the dilapidated barn might be a nuisance for farmers, reclaimed barn wood is a hot decorating trend from Manhattan to Manhattan Beach. Turn on HGTV, and you'll see people asking for reclaimed barn wood on many of their shows, including Fixer Upper. Using barn wood is so popular right now, it even has its own slot on the DIY Network  —   a show hosted by Mark Bowe called ”Barnwood Builders.” Old barn wood is called a lot of things in the construction business, like reclaimed, salvaged or repurposed. For 20 years, Bowe has been taking old barns apart. He says his customers are interested in what's called ”upcycling”  —   taking undesirable or waste materials and creatively reusing them. The barn siding he sells can turn into brewery bars or restaurant tables. ”Most people want those accent pieces,” he says. ”They want to have those pretty beams in the ceiling or they want to have the barn wood walls, or the tables and the furniture.” A few years ago, many farmers didn't understand how valuable their old barns were and might have been swindled, Bowe says, but today they know the capital they're sitting on. He says we're in the midst of a barn wood frenzy right now, but it still likely has a shelf life. Indeed, there are only so many weathered barns in the U. S. ”This is a finite resource,” he says, ”so it seems like every building we take down, we deplete our livelihood.” A tableau tradeoff, With every barn that comes down, the classic landscape of American farmland littered with wooden barns fades away. The National Barn Alliance is trying to make sure that doesn't happen by preserving the buildings it can and documenting those that will come down. ”Preservation in the past has really sought to preserve the great, grand mansions of important white men, but we're so far beyond that now as a discipline,” says Danae Peckler, an architectural historian with the alliance. ”We start to look at average landscapes that really tell the American story. And the farm is one of those.” Peckler says she understands the big changes happening in agriculture, and accompanying modern barns, but she hopes people at least take photos and write down the barn's history before salvaging it for parts and selling them. ”It makes me a little sad, but it also makes me a little excited,” Peckler says. ”It makes me think that we're realizing this has a cultural resonance with us.” The barns have sentimental value to many people. Mark Bowe knows this. ”We are changing the landscape for our future generations by removing these barns, and it is a bittersweet living for me,” he says. ”When we salvage barns for parts, we always take down the ones we know won't be standing in 15 years.” Preserving a barn's history, Mike Hudson hasn't been in the business as long as Bowe, but says he feels the same way. ”Sometimes it's not real exciting taking it down, because you understand the history behind the barn,” Hudson says. Hudson's business also deconstructs old barns,   the pieces and then sells them to contractors or designers. They'll use it for flooring, furniture and accent walls. And while he has acquired some barns for free, he has also paid up to $1, 000 for one. ”There's a lot of expense involved that people don't quite understand,” he says. ”Even if you got a free barn, it's not necessarily free. We spend an average of about $500 a day in bringing one of these down respectfully.” Hudson and his team were hired by Larry Gerdes in central Missouri to pull apart the barn by hand, using hammers and crowbars. It will take about two weeks to take Gerdes' barn down, Hudson says. In the end, he'll sell the wood for between $5 and $10 a square foot, depending on species, size and condition. Black walnut, red oak and chestnut are some of the more expensive species, he says. ”This is it. This is what I have a passion for,” he says. ”And if you can find that passion, that's what you stick with. It's not always about the money.” Hudson says he has an immense respect for the crafting and history of old barns. He takes photos to share with the owners and always asks about the history of the farm. ”That's the thing we take into consideration when we come in, because we're just as passionate about bringing it down properly [and] respectfully as the pioneers were back then to build it,” he says. So what happens when the barn wood trend fizzles out? Mark Bowe says look for people trying to repurpose material from a different era. ”Maybe we start to see more factory beams incorporated,” he says. ”The story becomes less about the early pioneer and more about the industrial age, with large factory timbers and factory floors.” This story comes to us from Harvest Public Media, a reporting collaboration focused on food and agriculture.",False,"Larry Gerdes is having his barn taken down and disassembled in Malta Bend, Mo.

260,116608,172098,How U.S. Businesses In Europe Are Already Planning For Brexit,NPR,Frank Langfitt,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/492142750/for-u-s-businesses-brexit-leads-to-uncertainty-and-worry,"As part of the project A Nation Engaged, NPR and member stations are exploring America's role in the world heading into the presidential election. The United Kingdom's planned split from the EU is expected to take years, but it's already creating uncertainty for multinational companies operating in the U. K. including many American firms. Brexit also poses challenges to the U. S. government, as Washington ponders a future in which a key ally has less influence in Europe and likely becomes less relevant on the global stage. Even before the June referendum, American and other financial firms were looking beyond the City of London  —   the Wall   at the core of Britain's capital  —   for new office space in Europe. Meanwhile, U. S. automakers are anticipating sizable financial hits from the decision to leave the EU. ”We see the impact on Ford of being somewhere in the range of $400 to $500 million each year,” said Bob Shanks, Ford's chief financial officer, on an investor call earlier this summer. General Motors says it is cutting worker hours in German factories because it expects less demand for cars in Great Britain following the June Brexit vote. The car companies also worry that new tariffs could hurt the competitiveness of their U. K. factories. The U. K.'s auto business, which is seen as very successful, sends more than half of its exports to the EU. ”It's vital for our U. K. automotive manufacturing, and for our huge retail market here that we secure unfettered access to European markets,” says Tamzen Isacsson, director of communications with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a U. K. industry group. If not, that could make it harder for auto plants in the U. K. to win future work. Plants routinely compete within companies for the opportunity to build new models, but because cars are built on   to   product plans, the June vote is not expected to have an immediate impact on which models are built there. ”The big issues are going to be   models coming up for renewal during the period of uncertainty,” says Graham Armitage, an auto analyst for KPMG. For instance, if it costs 10 percent extra to export a car from the U. K. into Europe after Brexit, Armitage says that could make building some models in the U. K. unprofitable. ”You're talking about tens of thousands of jobs that could be affected,” Armitage says. ”No one would say that all of those decisions will go against the U. K. but they're going to be tougher decisions than they would otherwise have been.” The British auto industry does have something in its favor: The United Kingdom is an attractive export market. Germany sends about 800, 000 cars a year to the U. K. and doesn't want retaliatory tariffs. Armitage says there are incentives for both sides to make a deal on market access. Relocations as   rights vanish, The outlook for the financial industry is a bit darker. Currently, firms in the City of London can freely offer a variety of financial services throughout the EU under what are called ”passporting” rights. Many analysts expect at least some of those rights will disappear after Brexit. Even before the June vote, JPMorgan Chase  Co. chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon warned company workers in the U. K. that he might have to send some of their jobs to mainland Europe. ”Today we can service EU companies here, freely  —   with systems, technology, research, investment banking,” Dimon told employees at JPMorgan's office in the city of Bournemouth, on the English Channel. ”After a Brexit, we cannot do it all here. And we will have to start planning for that. I don't know if it means 1, 000 jobs, 2, 000 jobs  —   it could be as many as 4, 000.” Andrew Gray, a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers, which advises investment banks, insurance companies and other firms on Brexit planning, says some companies are considering moving some operations to EU cities ranging from Dublin and Amsterdam to Paris and Luxembourg. But he says such moves are hugely complicated, because London offers so many financial support services and already has a very talented labor pool. ”A number of banks have estimated [that] to replicate even part of their infrastructure in Europe could take between five and 10 years,” says Gray. ”You have to be looking at real estate as an option,” adds Gray, who says companies will have to look for areas with appropriate schools, housing and financial expertise. ”There is only a finite supply of suitable real estate in a number of these locations.” A   relationship? As for the U. S. government, Brexit is a deep disappointment. During a visit to London last spring, Obama urged voters to cast their ballots in favor of staying in the EU  —   not just for economic reasons, but political as well. The U. S. traditionally has seen Great Britain as a valuable ally in many respects, including in pressing its interests with the EU. Washington also has struggled for years on an EU trade deal known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which it hoped would bind the U. S. and its allies more closely. Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at Kings College, says a united Europe that shares democratic values is a valuable asset for the U.

262,116610,172100,POLL: Most Americans Want Congress To Make Zika Funding A High Priority,NPR,Alison Kodjak,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/09/01/492103236/poll-most-americans-want-congress-to-make-zika-funding-a-high-priority,"Summer is winding down, but when members of Congress return to Washington from their vacations next week, many of their constituents want them to do something about the mosquitoes  —   the ones carrying Zika virus, to be specific. A new survey shows that three quarters of Americans say Congress should make the allocation of more money to deal with the Zika outbreaks in Florida and Puerto Rico an ”important” or ”top priority” when they return to Washington. ”People generally do value spending money when there is sort of a public health emergency,” says Mollyann Brodie, executive director of public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducted the survey. About half those surveyed said they'd be uncomfortable traveling to the areas of Florida where people have been infected by Zika. And 77 percent said pregnant woman are not safe in those areas. ”It is something that the local officials have to take really seriously,” Brodie says, ”because in many of those areas the tourism industry is a big part of those communities.” Obama asked for $1. 9 billion in emergency federal funding back in February to fight Zika. So far, Congress hasn't allocated anything. So the administration has been using money shifted from other accounts  —   including money that had been specified for studying and fighting Ebola, and for   emergency preparedness  —   to address the Zika threat, instead. Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, says his agency will be out of funds to fight Zika by the end of the month. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell issued a similar warning in August. But Mark Harkins, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Government Affairs Institute, says that  —   at least technically  —   the Obama administration could move even more money from other programs to fight Zika. Even though lawmakers usually allocate money for specific purposes, the federal budget allows for some shifting of funds, Harkins says. ”As part of the appropriations bills themselves there's always a provision that says you may transfer money or reprogram money, based on certain levels,” he says. ”And then they put in a little out that says, you can move money at any point, at any amount, as long as you give 15 days notice.” Some lawmakers seem to be daring the administration to do just that. Senators Charles Grassley,   and James Lankford,   wrote a letter to Burwell, dated Aug. 26, that pointed to $20 billion that is sitting unspent in the HHS and State Department budgets. It could be spent on Zika, the senators say. Lankford's staff provided NPR with a list of the accounts the letter refers to. They included Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses, the State Department's diplomatic and consular programs and programs in nonproliferation and  . The Senators simply added up all the money that remains unspent in the accounts Obama specified as needing additional funds, Harkins says. Grassley ”doesn't care that that money is supposed to be used for multiple different things,” says Harkins. ”He's just saying, 'If you think money should come out of that account, take any money that's left in that account. '” Meanwhile, as the White House and Congress debate the budget, state health officials are scrambling. Frank Welch, the head of community preparedness at Louisiana's health department, says his federal grant to prepare for all kinds of health emergencies was cut, and replaced with money that can only be used for Zika. ”But none of those other threats or emergencies that are very real possibilities have gone away,” he says, ”and we took about a $700, 000 dollar cut.” Louisiana is using the Zika money for mosquito control, to do public outreach and education about how to recognize and prevent infection. The state is also updating its lab to be able to do Zika testing. Welch says they've done a good job with prevention and preparedness, but there just isn't enough money left to deal with a Zika response if there's an outbreak in that state.",False,"Summer is winding down, but when members of Congress return to Washington from their vacations next week, many of their constituents want them to do something about the mosquitoes     the ones carrying Zika virus, to be specific. A new survey shows that three quarters of Americans say Congress should make the allocation of more money to deal with the Zika outbreaks in Florida and Puerto Rico an important or top priority when they return to Washington. People generally do value spending money when there is sort of a public health emergency, says Mollyann Brodie, executive director of public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducted the survey. About half those surveyed said they'd be uncomfortable traveling to the areas of Florida where people have been infected by Zika. And 77 percent said pregnant woman are not safe in those areas. It is something that the local officials have to take really seriously, Brodie says, because in many of those areas the tourism industry is a big part of those communities. Obama asked for $1. 9 billion in emergency federal funding back in February to fight Zika. So far, Congress hasn't allocated anything. So the administration has been using money shifted from other accounts     including money that had been specified for studying and fighting Ebola, and for   emergency preparedness     to address the Zika threat, instead. Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, says his agency will be out of funds to fight Zika by the end of the month. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell issued a similar warning in August.

265,127397,190494,Madeline weakens to tropical storm as nears Hawaii; Hermine approaches Florida,Reuters,Karin Stanton,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-atlantic-idUSKCN11618M  ," Hurricane Madeline weakened to a tropical storm on Wednesday as it advanced toward Hawaii's Big Island, while a hurricane warning was issued for another storm approaching the Gulf Coast of Florida, where the governor has called an emergency. Strong winds and driving rain pounded both northwest Florida and Big Island as residents braced for even wilder weather.  Hawaii officials opened shelters and closed offices, schools and roads on Wednesday to prepare for Madeline, which is expected to pass just south of the Big Island. ”We should all be hunkering down as the storm passes,” said Hawaii County Civil Defense spokeswoman Kanani Aton. Madeline, as it weakened with sustained winds of about 70 mph (113 kph) on Wednesday afternoon, was about 75 miles (121 km) southeast of the Big Island, said Central Pacific Hurricane Center meteorologist Ray Tanabe. The tropical storm, before it moves westward out of reach of Hawaii, could dump as much as 15 inches (40 cm) of rain on parts of the Big Island, according to the National Weather Service. The storm already was lashing the island with rain and wind, resulting in some road closures, Tanabe said. Hurricane Lester, currently a major Category 4 storm, could affect Hawaii over the weekend.  Hawaii Gov David Ige signed an emergency proclamation that runs through Sept. 9, freeing up state resources. Meantime, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for a portion of northwestern Florida as Tropical Storm Hermine continued to strengthen over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The system was located about 315 miles (510 kilometer)   of Tampa with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95  ) the   weather forecaster said late on Wednesday. The NHC said additional strengthening is forecast during the next 24 to 36 hours, and Hermine is expected to be a hurricane as it reaches the Florida's northern Gulf Coast by Thursday afternoon and then sweep across northern parts of the state with driving rain, then northeast along the Atlantic Coast. Florida's governor declared an emergency on Wednesday ahead of the brewing storm as many school districts along the Gulf Coast canceled   activities and ordered students to stay home on Thursday. Heavy rains were already pounding parts of the state on Wednesday. As much as 20 inches (50 cm) could fall over northwest Florida, the NHC said, warning of storm surges and ”  inundation.”  On its current path, the system would dump as much as 10 inches (25 cm) of rain on coastal areas of Georgia, which was under a tropical storm watch, and the Carolinas. Lori Hebert, 40, woke up on Wednesday to flood waters seeping into her house in the Tampa Bay region. Catfish came onto her driveway as the street flooded in Gulfport, a small waterfront city. ”We haven't gotten the main storm yet,” she said, loading a dozen sandbags into her van.  U. S. oil and gas producers in east of the Gulf of Mexico removed workers from 10 offshore platforms, moved drilling rigs and shut some output because of the storm.

267,127399,190496,Turkey wants to 'cleanse' strip of territory on Syrian border,Reuters,David Dolan,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey-idUSKCN1160Z1  ," Turkey wants to clear ISIS from a   ( ) stretch of territory on the Syrian side of its border, an official said on Wednesday, a week after it launched an incursion that has strained ties with the USA. Operation ”Euphrates Shield” in which Turkish troops and tanks entered Syria in support of rebels for the first time, began on Aug. 24 with the swift capture of Jarablus, a town a few km (miles) inside Syria that was held by the militant group.   rebels patrolled the town on motorbikes on Wednesday as children played in dusty alleys. The bulk of   forces have since moved further south into territory held by militias loyal to the   Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition supported by Washington in its bid to defeat the jihadists. Turkish clashes with SDF loyalists have alarmed the USA, which has described the Turkish action as ”unacceptable” because it hindered the battle against ISIS. But Turkey, which is fighting a Kurdish insurgency at home, says that, while it remains intent on clearing Islamist militants from its border region, it also wants to prevent Kurdish militias from seizing territory in their wake. Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said the goal was to drive ISIS from a   strip of land along the border with Turkey, which has been buffeted by a spate of bombings, blamed on the group, that have killed scores. ”Starting from Jarablus, the cleansing of this region is our priority,” Kalin told a news briefing. ”We have already cleansed 400 square km successfully.” Turkey has long said it wants a ”buffer zone” in the area, although it has not used the term during this incursion. As well as driving out the   Islamists, it also wants to prevent Kurdish forces taking territory that will let them join up cantons they control in northeast and northwest Syria. Turkey frets that seizing such a broad swathe of territory could embolden Kurdish PKK insurgents on Turkish soil. THUD OF EXPLOSIONS U. S. officials on Tuesday welcomed what appeared to be a pause in fighting between Turkish forces and rival militias, after days when the border area reverberated with Turkish warplanes roaring into Syria and artillery pounded Syrian sites, saying it was hitting Kurdish fighters. In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman told reporters on Wednesday there had been calm in northern Syria in the past 24 hours. ”We continue to work very closely with our coalition partner and ally Turkey in trying to address their concerns about this situation,” spokesman Peter Cook said. ”Likewise we continue to work with our partners in Syria to try and keep the focus where it should be,” he added. On Wednesday only the occasional thud of explosions in the distance was audible along the Turkish frontier. Ankara has denied statements from Kurdish fighters in Syria that a temporary truce had been agreed, saying it would not make any pact with the Kurdish YPG militia, a powerful force in the SDF coalition, as it considers it a terrorist body. ”The Turkish Republic is a sovereign state, a legitimate state. It cannot be equated with a terrorist organization,” EU Affairs Minister Omer Celik told   Anadolu news agency, adding this meant there could be no ”agreement between the two.” Turkey has demanded that the YPG cross the Euphrates river into a   canton in Syria's northeast. U. S. officials have threatened to withdraw backing for the YPG if it did not meet that demand, but have said that the Kurdish group has mostly done so. Turkey's EU affairs minister said some Kurdish fighters were still on the western side and called that ”unacceptable.” Eager to avoid more clashes between Turkey and U. S.  Syrian fighters, the Pentagon said the U. S.  coalition against ISIS was establishing communications channels to better coordinate in a ”crowded battlespace” in Syria. As well as battling ISIS in Syria, Turkey has been rounding up suspected militants at home. Interior Minister Efkan Ala said the authorities had arrested 865 people since the start of 2016, more than half of them foreigners, preventing them crossing through Turkey's long border with Syria and Iraq.

",False," Turkey wants to clear ISIS from a   ( ) stretch of territory on the Syrian side of its border, an official said on Wednesday, a week after it launched an incursion that has strained ties with the USA. Operation Euphrates Shield in which Turkish troops and tanks entered Syria in support of rebels for the first time, began on Aug. 24 with the swift capture of Jarablus, a town a few km (miles) inside Syria that was held by the militant group.   rebels patrolled the town on motorbikes on Wednesday as children played in dusty alleys. The bulk of   forces have since moved further south into territory held by militias loyal to the   Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition supported by Washington in its bid to defeat the jihadists. Turkish clashes with SDF loyalists have alarmed the USA, which has described the Turkish action as unacceptable because it hindered the battle against ISIS. But Turkey, which is fighting a Kurdish insurgency at home, says that, while it remains intent on clearing Islamist militants from its border region, it also wants to prevent Kurdish militias from seizing territory in their wake. Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said the goal was to drive ISIS from a   strip of land along the border with Turkey, which has been buffeted by a spate of bombings, blamed on the group, that have killed scores. Starting from Jarablus, the cleansing of this region is our priority, Kalin told a news briefing. We have already cleansed 400 square km successfully. Turkey has long said it wants a buffer zone in the area, although it has not used the term during this incursion. As well as driving out the   Islamists, it also wants to prevent Kurdish forces taking territory that will let them join up cantons they control in northeast and northwest Syria. Turkey frets that seizing such a broad swathe of territory could embolden Kurdish PKK insurgents on Turkish soil. THUD OF EXPLOSIONS U. S. officials on Tuesday welcomed what appeared to be a pause in fighting between Turkish forces and rival militias, after days when the border area reverberated with Turkish warplanes roaring into Syria and artillery pounded Syrian sites, saying it was hitting Kurdish fighters. In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman told reporters on Wednesday there had been calm in northern Syria in the past 24 hours. We continue to work very closely with our coalition partner and ally Turkey in trying to address their concerns about this situation, spokesman Peter Cook said.

Investors drove the stock to   lows after the global smartphone leader told Reuters late on Wednesday the shipments had been delayed for quality control testing, and that shipments to South Korea's top three mobile carriers had been halted. Faults with the new premium flagship device could deal a major blow to the South Korean giant, which was counting on the Galaxy Note 7 to maintain its strong mobile earnings momentum against Apple Inc's ( ) new iPhones expected to be unveiled next week. ”This is some major   for Samsung, especially given all of the   excitement that products like the Note 7 have been garnering lately,” IDC analyst Bryan Ma said.  ”The pending Apple launch puts all the more pressure for them to contain this quickly. The timing of this couldn't have been worse.”     Samsung did not comment on what problem it was trying to address or whether other markets were affected besides South Korea.  Sister company Samsung SDI Co Ltd ( ) said that while it was a supplier of Galaxy Note 7 batteries, it had received no information to suggest the batteries were faulty.         Several people posted images and videos of charred Galaxy Note 7s online and said their phones had caught on fire.  ”Be careful out there, everyone rocking the new Note 7, might catch fire y'all,” one user said in a YouTube clip showing a burnt Note phone. It was not immediately possible to confirm the veracity of the clip. Samsung's shares, which hit a record high of 1. 694 million won last week, fell 2 percent, and Samsung SDI tumbled 6. 1 percent, versus a 0. 1 percent fall for the broader market  . Several South Korean media reports, without citing direct sources, said Samsung will soon announce a plan to recall affected Note 7 phones and replace their batteries as opposed to giving the users a new device. A Samsung spokesman declined to comment on the reports.    DAMAGE CONTROL  Last year, production problems for the curved displays for the Galaxy S6 edge model resulted in disappointing sales, and Samsung risks a repeat this year if it cannot address the Galaxy Note 7 problems quickly.           Its mobile profit is on track to post annual growth for the first time in three years, thanks to robust sales of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge devices that it launched in March to critical acclaim. The Galaxy Note 7 received similar praise, raising expectations for strong sales in the second half. Samsung said in August demand for the new handset, priced at 988, 900 won ($882) in South Korea, was far exceeding supply, pushing the firm to delay the launch in some markets.  HDC Asset Management fund manager Park   said it now appeared inevitable that Samsung's smartphone average selling price and profits would miss lofty   expectations. ”Apple is supposed to show off the iPhone 7 next week and this issue has emerged, so the current state of things do not look good,” he said.

S. soil a few hours later. ”I hope that he does really, in his heart, have a little more compassion than what he spouts out,” said Dave Mitchell, 58, of Surprise, Arizona, a   moderate who says he is begrudgingly planning to vote for Trump. Arizona, a reliably Republican state in past elections, could prove to be a close race in the battle between Trump and Democratic rival Clinton. The   States of the Nation project, which is based on a national online opinion poll, found Trump leading Clinton by only 3 percentage points in the state as of Aug. 26.  Trump's   visit on Wednesday to Mexico was designed to appeal to moderate voters, including those most affected by illegal immigration, who are worried that the real estate mogul and former reality TV star lacks the temperament to engage in international diplomacy.  Pena Nieto had on Wednesday afternoon hailed the impromptu meeting with Trump as ”open and constructive.” Trump later referred to the Mexican leader as his friend and a ”wonderful” president. But only hours after leaving Mexico, Trump delivered a speech in Phoenix, Arizona, in which he again emphasized his desire to build a wall along the southern border and deport millions of people who had entered the USA illegally.  Pena Nieto later rebuked Trump as a threat to his country. Trump launched his campaign last year on a promise to build a wall along the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration, and accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers into the USA.

She said she had hoped Trump would take a more moderate tone after the meeting with the Mexican president, but was disappointed by his speech later that day in her home state. ”Being a moderate Republican means (being) an endangered species right now,” Yaeger said, explaining that she felt the party had moved too far to the right.   Lois Pidde, 70, an office manager in Casa Grande, said she agreed with Trump that immigration is a problem, but opposed his proposed solutions, such as the need for a border wall or a suspension of Muslim immigration to shore up national security.  ”I used to be able to turn him off when he was on 'The Apprentice' and I'd like to keep it that way,” she said, referring to Trump's reality TV show. She said she was likely to vote for New Mexico Gov Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. Josh Jensen, 35, a Border Patrol agent from southeastern Arizona, said he thinks Trump's plan to build a wall is   and is voting for Johnson too. ”I was thinking maybe Hillary over Trump,” Jensen said. “But I can't vote for either one of the two candidates.” April Chase, 58, of Arizona, was aware of Trump's trip to Mexico but did not watch it.

Mylan, whose tax address is in the Netherlands but with corporate headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, has raised the U.

S. politicians, the company on Monday said it will soon launch the first generic version of the device for $300, half the list price of its branded product. The EpiPen jabs a dose of the drug epinephrine into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions such as to peanuts, food allergies and bee stings.

S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The National Labor Relations board on Aug. 26 sided with the UAW in the union's effort to get VW to negotiate wages and benefits for about 160 of the 1, 500 hourly workers at a VW plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Thursday's filing was expected. The NLRB decision for the UAW in the dispute was highly anticipated, and VW had previously said it would appeal if the ruling went against the   company. The union sought to represent only a portion of the plant's workers after it in February 2014 narrowly lost an election to represent all 1, 500 hourly workers at the Chattanooga plant. In December 2015, the union handily won the right to represent about 160 skilled trades workers who maintain machinery at the plant. The UAW has never been able to win an organizing vote at a   auto assembly plant in the U. S. south. A victory, even for only a portion of workers at the VW plant, would give the union a stronger foothold in the south, where most   auto plants are located. On Thursday, VW said in a statement that it ”respects the right of all of our employees to decide the question of union representation. This is why we disagree with the decision to separate Volkswagen maintenance and production workers and will continue our effort to allow everyone to vote as one group on the matter of union representation.”   UAW   Gary Casteel said in a statement on Thursday evening that the union is ”disappointed that Volkswagen is continuing to thumb its nose at the federal government. The federal courts have consistently upheld the NLRB labor standard that enabled the   vote in Chattanooga.” The UAW has for several years been assisted in its effort to organize workers in Tennessee by the powerful German union IG Metall, which has members on the VW Supervisory Board. Earlier on Thursday, the head of IG Metall, Joerg Hofman,  demanded that VW enter talks with the   workers.

275,127418,190522,Venezuelan opposition floods Caracas in vast anti-Maduro protest,Reuters,Diego Oré and Brian Ellsworth,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKCN1173LS  ," Opponents of President Nicolas Maduro flooded Venezuela's capital on Thursday in one of the biggest mass protests against socialist rule for more than a decade. Dressed in white and chanting ”this government will fall,” hundreds of thousands rallied across Caracas to demand a recall referendum against Maduro and decry a deep economic crisis in the South American OPEC nation. The opposition Democratic Unity coalition estimated at least 1 million people took part after protesters streamed into Caracas from the Amazon jungle to the western Andes.   ”We are going to bring down Maduro!” said Naty Gutierrez, 53, whose   (120 km) drive from Maracay into Caracas took three times longer than usual due to soldiers' roadblocks.  ”We are going to defeat hunger, crime, inflation and corruption. They've done nothing in 17 years. Their time is finished,” she said, surrounded by thousands of people waving banners and national flags at one gathering point. The government, which mounted its own, smaller   did not give numbers for the turnout. The opposition hoped its protests would prove they are the majority and heap pressure on Maduro and the national election board to allow a plebiscite on his rule, as allowed by the constitution   through a presidential term. But with the election board dragging its feet over the process and the government swearing the referendum will not happen this year, the opposition has no way to force it no matter how many people it brings onto the streets.  The timing is   because if a plebiscite were held in 2017 and Maduro lost, his handpicked vice president would take over for the ruling Socialist Party, rather than triggering a new presidential election. In power since Hugo Chavez's presidency from 1999, the socialists have hit a low ebb as falling oil prices and a failing   economy have left the country in turmoil.   inflation, a third year of recession, shortages of basics, and long lines at shops have exasperated many of Venezuela's 30 million people. The frustration led to a resounding opposition win in a December legislative vote. ”READY FOR EVERYTHING” Maduro, 53, denounced what the opposition had billed as the ”Takeover of Caracas” as a front for coup plans, akin to a   2002 putsch against his mentor Chavez, who died of cancer three years ago. Maduro has failed to replicate his charismatic predecessor's popular appeal, and his ratings in opinion polls have halved to just over 20 percent. ”We have stopped the coup today, the violent, fascist ambush,” Maduro told supporters, saying detentions of activists in recent days had prevented violence. At least a dozen opposition campaigners were still in custody on Thursday, according to rights groups and the opposition. Extra police and troops were positioned around Caracas, and there were roadblocks on most major routes into the capital from the provinces, with buses being blocked and traffic crawling. ”All they are interested in is staying in power,” said construction worker Luis Palacios, 59, from the poor Caracas neighborhood of Petare. ”We want change, we are hungry.” After the main events had finished peacefully, a small group of youths, many covering their faces, hurled stones and petrol bombs at security forces who fired back teargas during a standoff on a highway in Caracas.  The opposition Democratic Unity coalition said the youths  were infiltrators trying to sow trouble. Fearing violence, especially given 43 deaths around   protests in 2014, many businesses in the capital had stayed closed. Dozens of indigenous people marched hundreds of miles from their home state of Amazonas. Swearing loyalty to Chavez's legacy and calling opposition leaders a wealthy elite intent on controlling Venezuela's oil, thousands of   government supporters also gathered for  . ”The opposition want to topple the president, but they won't be able to,” said lawyer and civil servant Adriana Jimenez, 44, at one such rally close to a huge inflatable puppet of Chavez in downtown Caracas. Like other ”Chavista” loyalists, she blamed Venezuela's ailing economy on an ”economic war” by businessmen hiking prices and hoarding goods. Maduro joined his supporters in the afternoon, singing on stage and pumping his fist in the air.  The opposition called a nationwide protest of banging pots and pans for   and announced a timetable for further rallies in coming weeks.

MORE FROM REUTERS: HPE has received offers for the software unit of as much as $7. 5 billion in a sale process managed by investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( ) the sources said this week. Thoma Bravo has made the highest offer for the assets among the private equity firms that held discussions with HPE, though significant discrepancies in valuation expectations persist and no deal is certain, the people said.

It was still possible that HPE would turn to a buyout firm other than Thoma Bravo to pursue a deal, or that Thoma Bravo would buy only some of the assets, the people said. A sale of HPE's entire software division to a single private equity firm would be easier if the latter already owns some related companies, the people said. Thoma Bravo owns several software companies, including Dynatrace LLC and Compuware Corp, which could produce cost savings and efficiencies if combined with some of HPE's software assets, the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. HPE, Goldman Sachs, Thoma Bravo, Vista Equity, Carlyle and TPG declined to comment. HPE shares rose as much as 4 percent on the news and ended Thursday's NY trading up 3. 2 percent at $22. 16, giving the company a market capitalization of $36. 8 billion. HPE's software unit generated $3. 6 billion in net revenue in 2015, down from $3. 9 billion in 2014. The company has said revenue growth in its software unit has been challenged by a market shift toward cloud subscription offerings. HPE acquired part of its software portfolio as a result of its   $10. 3 billion acquisition of Autonomy Corp in 2011 and the $4. 5 billion acquisition of Mercury Interactive in 2006. The software assets also include Vertica, a big data analytics platform, ArcSight, a cyber security firm as well as products for IT operations management. HPE is the latest technology company looking to slim down a large portfolio of noncore software assets that are struggling to generate growth. In June, Dell Inc [DI.

Uber, in a statement, said it intends to appeal to a Pennsylvania state court, and overturn what it called an ”absurd” fine imposed for ”technical violations.” The PUC, which regulates taxi services and Uber rivals such as Lyft, had sanctioned Uber for having from February to August 2014 provided 122, 998 rides in Pennsylvania without prior approval, and obstructing a state probe into its operations. It imposed the fine on April 21, reducing it from the $49. 9 million ordered by two administrative law judges. The PUC agreed in June to reconsider the payout at Uber's request, over the objection of state officials who called the fine an ”appropriate response” to Uber's ”lawless conduct.” Uber offered new evidence that its service benefited Pennsylvanians, and that any fine should be capped at $1, 000 per day, or roughly $200, 000, and not based on the number of trips. But the PUC said in its   decision that Uber ”failed to set forth any new and novel arguments that appear to have been overlooked or not addressed in our prior determination.” In its statement, Uber said the decision sends a ”troubling message that Pennsylvania is unwelcoming to technology and innovation,” and shows why the state needs ”permanent, statewide   legislation as soon as possible.” Based in San Francisco, Uber has drawn criticism from taxi companies losing market share, regulators concerned about driver and passenger safety, and riders upset over high prices. The PUC previously found that Uber had in 2014 posed a risk to public safety by offering rides without proof its drivers, vehicles and insurance provisions met state standards.

S. Senate Democrats would not agree to postponing completion of this year's spending legislation until 2017, the chamber's top Democrat said on Thursday, warning the majority Republicans against considering such an approach when Congress returns next week. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid spoke after some conservative groups outside Congress earlier this week said it would be better for lawmakers not to finish a government appropriations bills until early 2017, when there will be a new president who could work out a deal with a newly elected Congress. The lawmakers return to work next week from a lengthy recess with appropriations bills unfinished for the coming fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. By law, lawmakers must act by Sept. 30 to approve the spending bills, or the government shuts down, as it did for two weeks in 2013 when appropriations bills had not been enacted in time. In a conference call with reporters, Reid said he worried that ”we're headed straight for another unnecessary government shutdown” unless action is taken.  Congress could pass a   continuing resolution that would keep the government running at current spending levels until next year, postponing final appropriations decisions until then without shutting down the government. Reid said Democrats favored approving a shorter   bill that would let lawmakers return to Washington later this year   presumably after the Nov. 8 election   to finish spending bills. ”But we are not doing anything into next year,” he said. ”And the Republicans should be made aware of that right now.”  Reid said he had met with Obama on Wednesday, implying Obama endorsed his stance. Although Democrats are in the minority in both the Senate and House, rules requiring a supermajority for many Senate actions give Democrats significant leverage. More than two dozen conservative groups wrote to lawmakers this week saying they were worried that Congress would use what is called a ”lame duck” session immediately after the election to tack on additional spending and corporate welfare provisions to the appropriations bills. Among other things, Congress has not been able to decide how much to spend to fight the   Zika virus. The Republican leadership has not announced its plans for finishing work on spending bills.

","      Just over a year ago, Allegiant Air pilot Jason Kinzer was sitting in the cockpit of a    McDonnell Douglas   aircraft bound for Hagerstown, Md. having just taken off from St. Petersburg, Fla. As the plane climbed through 2, 500 feet, a cabin attendant alerted Kinzer to a strong burning smell. Alarmed, Kinzer turned Allegiant Air Flight 864 back toward the airport. Fire and rescue crews met the plane on the runway as smoke wafted from an engine. Kinzer told the 144 passengers to disembark. He then helped a flight attendant carry a paraplegic passenger to the exit. It seemed to be model behavior. But Allegiant Air did not praise Kinzer. It fired him. In a dismissal letter, the airline called the evacuation of the plane “unwarranted” and faulted Kinzer as not “striving to preserve the Company's assets, aircraft, ground equipment, fuel and the personal time of our employees and customers. ” Later, the company's attorneys would call Kinzer's account an “inaccurate and   recitation of events. ” Kinzer's saga, now the subject of a court case in Nevada, involves one of dozens of incidents that have prompted scrutiny of the safety and maintenance practices at Allegiant Air, a   carrier that has found a profitable niche in serving airports in    cities.   In an industry that has habitually struggled to make money, Allegiant's soaring earnings stand out. Last year, its profits jumped 154 percent, to $220. 4 million, as the carrier  —   relying heavily on cheaper, previously used planes  —   flew more than 300 routes. In June, Allegiant announced a dozen new routes and three new cities, for the first time competing with major carriers at airports in Newark and Denver.  [Flights are about to become cheaper]  But observers with various interests and viewpoints are asking whether Allegiant has pursued fast growth and financial success at the expense of other considerations. Unwanted attention has come from federal regulators worried about safety, investors betting against the stock, a pilots union concerned about maintenance, and corporate governance experts who fault the airline's cozy board of directors as not doing more to head off problems. About 300 pages of Federal Aviation Administration records for Allegiant show a pattern of safety problems that triggered a relatively large number of aborted takeoffs, emergency descents and emergency landings from Jan. 1, 2015, through this March. The Allegiant records were obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Robert MacArthur, owner of Alternative Research Services, a consultancy that caters to short sellers  —   investors who benefit when company share prices drop. Allegiant had about nine times as many serious incidents over that period as Delta Air Lines had with similar types of planes of similar vintage  —   even though Delta was flying about three times as many such planes, according to a Washington Post analysis of FAA documents relating to both companies. “I don't think there's a safety problem,” Allegiant's chief operating officer, Jude Bricker, said in an interview. “Our unscheduled landings in particular are a result primarily of an abundance of caution, and our pilots are entitled to put their planes into landing anytime they feel unsafe. ” But leading experts said Allegiant needs to pay closer attention to its aging aircraft. “They just have a lot of problems with leaks, doors not closing properly, things not working properly,” said Mary F. Schiavo, an aviation lawyer who served as inspector general for the Department of Transportation from 1990 to 1996. “They have electrical smells every day, which means they've got old wiring. It's just kind of a poorly maintained fleet. ” Allegiant said that its “safety protocols emphasize putting the safety of passengers foremost. ” And in July, the company said it had agreed to depart from customary practice and buy 12 new Airbus A320s for delivery by 2018.    The fortunes of chief executive Maurice J. Gallagher Jr. are tied to Allegiant Air's performance. Higher maintenance spending could cut into profits  —   and hurt the company's stock price. Gallagher, who does not take a base salary, owns about 20 percent of the company and received more than $4 million in dividends last year. On March 9, he sold shares of Allegiant worth $47. 8 million. (Andrew   News)  A swift ascent The chief executive of Allegiant Air is Maurice “Maury” J. Gallagher Jr. who ran ValuJet until one of its planes plunged into the Florida Everglades in 1996, killing all 110 people aboard. In 1999, after ValuJet was merged into AirTran, Gallagher started building a new carrier, Allegiant Air, which now has about 80 planes serving about 113 airports. The Las   company became the darling of Wall Street. It was the subject of a glowing article in Fast Company. It made Fortune's list of   companies. Aviation Week in 2013 named it the   small carrier in the world. Although the stock has lost nearly half its value since its peak of $234 a share last year, it has increased more than fivefold in the past decade. Analysts hailed Gallagher's strategy of buying older   often for a tenth of the $40 million to $50 million its competitors were paying for new aircraft. The average age of Allegiant's   fleet is 26. 49 years; recently added Airbus planes also are used, with an average age of 14. 2 years. But Allegiant Air has run into trouble. Allegiant aircraft this year made unscheduled landings on Feb. 28; on March 2, 3 and 14; and twice on March 13, according to FAA documents. On March 5, a crew aborted a takeoff after a loud bang, warning signs from the right engine and smoke in the cabin. One flight attendant was treated by emergency medical technicians for smoke inhalation. All airlines must file reports about safety and maintenance incidents with the FAA. After Allegiant's spate of midair incidents, the agency moved up a periodic evaluation of the airline that had been scheduled for 2018. “The purpose of these reviews is to verify a company is complying with the applicable regulations; determine whether it is operating at the highest possible degree of safety; and identify and address any   issues,” the FAA said, although it would not comment on Allegiant. Later, in a July 18 letter to Allegiant, the FAA said it had “identified several element design and element performance deficiencies”  —   such as software that did not meet FAA specifications and a failure to notice fractures in a   pylon  —   and ordered the airline to come up with a “mitigation plan” by Sept. 30. The FAA said two findings “revealed possible regulatory issues” but did not describe them. Schiavo  —   author of “Flying Blind, Flying Safe,” a book critical of the FAA  —   said the agency needs to take a tougher stance.  “I think that the FAA bears some responsibility for this horrible track record,” said Schiavo, who works at the law firm Motley Rice, which specializes in   lawsuits but has not been involved in any cases involving Allegiant. “The FAA sees its job as promoting the airlines and keeping them flying. They really try to keep just about any hunk of junk” flying. The FAA documents suggest that the agency had expressed concerns before. When Allegiant Air sought FAA approval of a new safety chief, the agency in a Feb. 1, 2016, report described qualifications for the position  —   “the education” and “vast experience” needed to “help lead the airline in providing the public with the safest means of commercial travel”  —   and then said it approved the appointment “with concern and trepidation. ” An Allegiant spokesman, Hilarie Grey, referred The Post to the FAA for comment. The FAA did not elaborate. Gallagher said the findings of this year's FAA inspection were “minor or less than minor. ” “So when you send 30 people around for 90 days in any organization, they're going to find stuff, as well they should. And we'll respond and adjust it,” Gallagher said in a July 29 conference call with securities analysts. But he said “there's nothing that operationally we're going to do substantially different. ” The FAA said it “will closely monitor” the carrier's efforts.    Allegiant told the FAA that for the 15 months ending in March, its 50 McDonnell Douglas planes  —   including   and    —   had 50 unscheduled landings, five emergency descents and eight aborted takeoffs. (Michael  )  Operational incidents The FAA's Service Difficulty Reports cover issues ranging from a   light bulb on a cabin exit sign to an engine failure. The Post examined FAA reports from Allegiant for 15 months ending in March and focused on the three types of operational incidents that aviation experts deem most significant: emergency descents, unscheduled landings and aborted takeoffs. The Post then compared Allegiant's record with Delta's by obtaining and reviewing reports filed by Delta for the same aircraft models for the same period. Delta flies more than twice as many   and   and more than four times as many of the Airbus models, but Allegiant had many more serious incidents. Allegiant told the FAA that its 50 McDonnell Douglas planes  —   including   and    —   had 50 unscheduled landings, five emergency descents and eight aborted takeoffs. From Jan. 1, 2015, through the end of March 2016, Delta reported that its 117   aircraft had six unscheduled landings, one emergency descent and no aborted takeoffs. For its 30 Airbus jetliners, Allegiant reported five unscheduled landings, two aborted takeoffs and one emergency descent. Delta reported that its 126 Airbus planes had one unscheduled landing, no aborted takeoffs and no emergency descents. Allegiant's Bricker said that “the reporting criteria [to the FAA] is open to interpretation and therefore is vastly different from fleet to fleet. ” In less than a year, a single Allegiant   had almost as many incidents as the entire Delta fleet of   FAA records show. In August 2015, that plane took off from Memphis and was at 16, 000 feet, climbing to cruising altitude, when one of its two engines shut down. The crew declared an emergency and landed the plane. In November, the same plane made an unscheduled landing after flight attendants said the air in the cabin had grown hazy and they smelled something burning. Three weeks later, the plane's pilot made another unscheduled landing after a gray haze filled the cabin. During a flight 12 days after that, the plane had reached cruising altitude when the cockpit crew noticed the “odor of evaporating oil,” which led to the replacement of the left engine before the plane was flown again. Repeated problems with other Allegiant   were common. One aircraft made three unscheduled landings. Another was met by firetrucks this year after an engine failed in flight. Six months earlier, the same plane made an emergency descent and an unscheduled landing after its instrument panel started to smoke. That incident occurred 10 days after the same plane made an unscheduled landing when the tail compartment next to the plane's engines overheated. “I just don't like the look, feel or smell of their track record,” Schiavo said.  [‘I have people's blood on my feet': Severe turbulence on Allegiant Air flight lands passengers in hospital]  A caller to the FAA's hotline said that an Allegiant    suffered engine failures twice, on July 31 and Aug. 3, 2015, both times en route to Richmond from St. Petersburg. On one of those flights, the crew reported the smell of burning rubber and a grinding noise followed by the failure of an engine. A maintenance crew later found a compressor “severely damaged,” and the engine was replaced, the FAA said. Bricker said that Allegiant takes “older airplanes to isolated areas, where we don't have our own mechanics” and therefore they are more likely to turn back if there's trouble.    Allegiant says it will spend more on maintenance this year. (Michael  )  Clashes with union Allegiant says the controversy about its safety record is due in large part to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The airline's pilots voted to join the Teamsters in 2012 and, after prolonged negotiations, reached an agreement with the company on June 21. A company spokesman said the union had made a “significant effort” to create “negative media coverage” of Allegiant. The company said that “one of those tactics” was to issue safety reports about the fleet. “There's never been any denial or doubt or rebuttal by the company to refute the number of engine failures, aborted takeoffs or near crashes,” said Daniel C. Wells, president of Teamsters Local 1224. “No one ever said those were false reports. ” The union has issued safety reports on Allegiant for the past three years that are based on what its members have reported. Wells said the contract would “not lessen our concern about getting the safety issues fixed with Allegiant, first for our members and, of course, the flying public. ” The company said in a statement: “Allegiant is a very safe airline. We have robust internal and external auditing programs and are investing heavily in new training programs and technologies that are industry leading. ” Allegiant says it will spend more on maintenance this year. According to the MIT Airline Data Project, Allegiant's maintenance spending hit $72. 7 million in 2011, then fell to $33. 6 million and $38. 7 million the next two years, less than in any other year since 2008, when it was a much smaller company. Maintenance spending climbed again, to $62. 3 million, in 2014. Allegiant spokeswoman Wheeler said the fluctuations were “largely driven by scheduled maintenance events. ” She said that in 2011, the airline “underwent a   engine overhaul project. ” The company said that it is in regular contact with the FAA and that its maintenance programs are “in accordance with all standards of the airline industry. ” On Aug. 5, it cut the ribbon on a new training center in Florida for pilots, flight attendants and mechanics. Higher maintenance spending could cut into profits  —   and the company's stock price. The fortunes of chief executive Gallagher are tied to that performance. Although he does not take a base salary, he owns about 20 percent of the company and received more than $4 million in dividends last year. On March 9, he sold shares of Allegiant worth $47. 8 million. Despite the string of safety incidents in 2015, the company's board also gave him a nearly $3 million bonus, putting his total compensation for that year at the same level as his counterpart's at   rival JetBlue, which is about four times larger. Waiting for a resolution Kinzer isn't flying these days. Broke and unable to get a job in aviation, he is trying to start a photography business and is waiting for the court case to begin. Bricker and Wheeler declined to comment on the litigation. Allegiant's attorneys in Nevada moved in federal court to have the case dismissed. A judge rejected the motion and sent the case back to state court. On July 18, Kinzer's attorneys filed depositions, including one by Capt. Cameron Graff, a witness for Allegiant, who in reply to a question said: “It's my opinion that Capt. Kinzer was terminated to quell the pilot group, to silence the pilot group, to in a way ‘take one out' to keep the pilots from reporting safety events, emergencies, those types of events. ”  Steven Rich contributed to this report.

Delta reported that its 126 Airbus planes had one unscheduled landing, no aborted takeoffs and no emergency descents. Allegiant's Bricker said that the reporting criteria [to the FAA] is open to interpretation and therefore is vastly different from fleet to fleet.  In less than a year, a single Allegiant   had almost as many incidents as the entire Delta fleet of   FAA records show. In August 2015, that plane took off from Memphis and was at 16, 000 feet, climbing to cruising altitude, when one of its two engines shut down. The crew declared an emergency and landed the plane. In November, the same plane made an unscheduled landing after flight attendants said the air in the cabin had grown hazy and they smelled something burning. Three weeks later, the plane's pilot made another unscheduled landing after a gray haze filled the cabin. During a flight 12 days after that, the plane had reached cruising altitude when the cockpit crew noticed the odor of evaporating oil, which led to the replacement of the left engine before the plane was flown again. Repeated problems with other Allegiant   were common. One aircraft made three unscheduled landings. Another was met by firetrucks this year after an engine failed in flight. Six months earlier, the same plane made an emergency descent and an unscheduled landing after its instrument panel started to smoke. That incident occurred 10 days after the same plane made an unscheduled landing when the tail compartment next to the plane's engines overheated. I just don't like the look, feel or smell of their track record, Schiavo said.  [I have people's blood on my feet': Severe turbulence on Allegiant Air flight lands passengers in hospital]  A caller to the FAA's hotline said that an Allegiant    suffered engine failures twice, on July 31 and Aug. 3, 2015, both times en route to Richmond from St. Petersburg. On one of those flights, the crew reported the smell of burning rubber and a grinding noise followed by the failure of an engine. A maintenance crew later found a compressor severely damaged, and the engine was replaced, the FAA said. Bricker said that Allegiant takes older airplanes to isolated areas, where we don't have our own mechanics and therefore they are more likely to turn back if there's trouble.    Allegiant says it will spend more on maintenance this year. (Michael  )  Clashes with union Allegiant says the controversy about its safety record is due in large part to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The airline's pilots voted to join the Teamsters in 2012 and, after prolonged negotiations, reached an agreement with the company on June 21. A company spokesman said the union had made a significant effort to create negative media coverage of Allegiant. The company said that one of those tactics was to issue safety reports about the fleet. There's never been any denial or doubt or rebuttal by the company to refute the number of engine failures, aborted takeoffs or near crashes, said Daniel C. Wells, president of Teamsters Local 1224. No one ever said those were false reports.  The union has issued safety reports on Allegiant for the past three years that are based on what its members have reported. Wells said the contract would not lessen our concern about getting the safety issues fixed with Allegiant, first for our members and, of course, the flying public.  The company said in a statement: Allegiant is a very safe airline. We have robust internal and external auditing programs and are investing heavily in new training programs and technologies that are industry leading.  Allegiant says it will spend more on maintenance this year. According to the MIT Airline Data Project, Allegiant's maintenance spending hit $72. 7 million in 2011, then fell to $33. 6 million and $38. 7 million the next two years, less than in any other year since 2008, when it was a much smaller company. Maintenance spending climbed again, to $62. 3 million, in 2014. Allegiant spokeswoman Wheeler said the fluctuations were largely driven by scheduled maintenance events.  She said that in 2011, the airline underwent a   engine overhaul project.  The company said that it is in regular contact with the FAA and that its maintenance programs are in accordance with all standards of the airline industry.  On Aug. 5, it cut the ribbon on a new training center in Florida for pilots, flight attendants and mechanics. Higher maintenance spending could cut into profits     and the company's stock price. The fortunes of chief executive Gallagher are tied to that performance. Although he does not take a base salary, he owns about 20 percent of the company and received more than $4 million in dividends last year. On March 9, he sold shares of Allegiant worth $47. 8 million. Despite the string of safety incidents in 2015, the company's board also gave him a nearly $3 million bonus, putting his total compensation for that year at the same level as his counterpart's at   rival JetBlue, which is about four times larger. Waiting for a resolution Kinzer isn't flying these days. Broke and unable to get a job in aviation, he is trying to start a photography business and is waiting for the court case to begin. Bricker and Wheeler declined to comment on the litigation. Allegiant's attorneys in Nevada moved in federal court to have the case dismissed. A judge rejected the motion and sent the case back to state court. On July 18, Kinzer's attorneys filed depositions, including one by Capt. Cameron Graff, a witness for Allegiant, who in reply to a question said: It's my opinion that Capt. Kinzer was terminated to quell the pilot group, to silence the pilot group, to in a way take one out' to keep the pilots from reporting safety events, emergencies, those types of events.

","  PHOENIX  —   Trump's latest immigration proposals would require a dramatic and costly expansion of the U. S.   system  —   targeting millions more people for immediate removal while also making it much harder for millions of others to enter the country legally. The deportation priorities outlined by the Republican presidential nominee during a policy address here late Wednesday would target at least 5 million and as many as 6. 5 million undocumented immigrants for swift removal, or about half of the 11 million estimated to be living in the USA. And he left open the possibility that he would seek to deport many more as well. “Anyone who has entered the USA illegally is subject to deportation,” Trump said.  Trump delivered a series of similarly sweeping statements and proposals during the   speech, following a tortuous   period in which he had signaled that he might soften his tone on the issue instead. He not only called for removing all undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes, but also said he would prioritize the deportation of those who have overstayed their visas.  To accomplish that goal, he said he would triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and create a “new special deportation task force” to track the most serious security threats.        “We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty,” he said. “Our message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the USA by illegally entering our country. Can't do it. ”  [  Trump's immigration speech]  That speech, which followed a quick visit to Mexico earlier Wednesday to meet with President Enrique Peña Nieto, effectively shut down speculation that he would move toward the center on immigration issues before Election Day. Many Republican strategists hoped that such a move would help him court moderate voters and regain ground against his Democratic rival, Clinton. His speech also prompted resignations on Thursday by several members of his Hispanic Advisory Council, who said they felt misled by earlier overtures. There has been widespread confusion about Trump's position in recent weeks, in part because he has repeatedly contradicted himself in public statements about mass deportation. He said in Phoenix that what becomes of the 11 million undocumented immigrants “will never be a central issue” even as he vowed that he would begin removing millions on “day one, as soon as I take office. ” And although he rejected any possible path to legal status  —   or “amnesty”  —   during that speech, he suggested Thursday during an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham that he would revisit legalization after his border security policies were enacted. Despite the confusion, what is clear is that Trump's specific deportation prescriptions would require an expansive effort.  An estimated 690, 000 undocumented immigrants have committed significant crimes that would make them security priorities  —   felonies or serious misdemeanors  —   according to a study by the Migration Policy Institute. That number is closer to 2 million according to some, including Jessica Vaughan of the   Center for Immigration Studies, whom the Trump campaign has consulted on the issue. If visa overstays are included in the immediate priorities, as Trump said he would order during his speech, the number would grow by about 4. 5 million people, according to estimates that place overstays at about 40 percent of the total undocumented population.

The Michigan construction executive, a longtime ally of 2012 Republicans nominee Mitt Romney and a top fundraiser for Sen. Marco Rubio, was not yet sold on raising funds for Trump. But the Trump who Rakolta encountered in a suite on the 27th floor was nothing like the provocateur he expected. “He is extremely ” Rakolta said. “None of the stuff that I imagined. ” The two had a   discussion about why auto companies build plants in countries such as Mexico instead of the USA.

","      Bald but beaming,    Eden Oyelola yanked the long rope to ring the “victory bell” at Children's National Medical Center last September. She was finally done with her treatment for brain cancer  —   surgery followed by months of radiation and chemotherapy that made her terribly ill. At a “bell party” at her home in Upper Marlboro, Md. later that week, she gobbled down ice cream with friends and rode a pony around the back yard. Her parents exhaled in relief. “We thought she was in the clear,” her father said. The relief was  . In January, the little girl who loved gymnastics started having seizures and losing control of her left side. She frequently stumbled. “What's wrong with my legs?” she asked. A second surgery followed after an MRI showed that the tumor had returned, forcing her doctors at Children's to ask whether there was anything else that would give Eden a chance to survive.  The team ultimately turned to the hottest field in medicine and a new class of drugs that has had stunning success in some adults, including former president Jimmy Carter, with even    malignancies. Growing ranks of pediatric oncologists are considering immunotherapy and “checkpoint inhibitors” to try to save desperately ill children.  But young patients with cancer present a special challenge. Research can seem more dangerous because of their age, and drugs that work in adults may fail for the same reason. No one can yet say with certainty whether  —   or to what degree  —   these treatments hold equal promise for children. That allows for hope as well as, in Eden's case, devastating disappointment. “It's a new horizon that we need to explore and see if it can help these kids,” said Brian Rood, Eden's  . “But we're still learning how to use it. ”   [Immunotherapy shows promise in a growing list of cancers]   Immunotherapy, which one specialist calls “the fourth pillar of cancer treatment” after surgery, radiation and chemo, marshals the body's immune system to fight a malignancy. As part of that approach, checkpoint inhibitors disrupt a cloaking device tumors wield to evade and suppress T cells, the foot soldiers of the immune system. Once T cells can see the cancer, they attack it just as they would other foreign intruders such as bacteria.    Four checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for adults, but they are only now undergoing broader testing in children. The lag reflects the many significant hurdles of conducting clinical trials with this age group. Eden's doctors set their hopes on a     clinical trial led by Children's, a study testing a checkpoint inhibitor treatment in children who have aggressive brain tumors. The complex strategy has its own set of risks; the treatment often causes inflammation and swelling, a dangerous combination in the contained space of the brain. In describing the trial to Eden's parents, Rood was cautious. Their daughter would need yet another surgery to reduce the size of her tumor, and there was no guarantee she would be eligible for the trial after that, or that the treatment would work. “About the best we can say,” Rood acknowledged, “is that we don't know that it doesn't work. ” “Eden will be a guinea pig,” thought Eden's mother, Sara Amare. But like her husband, Toks Oyelola, she was eager to press ahead. Both knew that the study medication, Keytruda, also called pembrolizumab, was the same one that Carter received after advanced melanoma spread to his liver and brain. Last December, following surgery, radiation and the immunotherapy, the former president announced that his cancer had disappeared. “He was 91,” Amare said. “I thought, ‘Surely, this will work in a   .' ”    As a child with cancer, Eden belongs to a relatively small group. An estimated 16, 000 children up to age 19 will be diagnosed with the disease in the USA this year, and it will kill fewer than 2, 000. By contrast, about 1. 6 million adults are expected to get a diagnosis, and more than 590, 000 will die of the disease. Pediatric oncologists complain that medicines for children are too few and too toxic, largely because drug companies focus their efforts on the adult market. Only one immunotherapy drug has been specifically approved for pediatric cancer. “Over the last 30 years, we have had very, very few new drugs in our clinics, and we still rely on radiation and chemo,” said Michael Jensen, director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle Children's. “When a drug is developed for prostate cancer or breast cancer or colon cancer, they will say, ‘Here, try this for kids with brain tumors.' It really doesn't help these underserved kids. ”       Eden likes drawing, ponies, and the toy babies and pets called Twozies. (Michael S.   Washington Post)  Researchers have long known that children are not simply miniature adults; they are biologically different. They tend to get different cancers than adults  —   leukemia rather than lung cancer, for example  —   and even the same cancer can play out differently in their bodies. So, perhaps, may immunotherapy. Many adult tumors have mutations caused by cigarette smoke, sunlight and other environmental insults. Once unmasked by a checkpoint inhibitor, such mutations can be seen by the immune system as “foreign” and deserving of attack. Children's cancers, however, generally have far fewer mutations and thus may offer fewer targets, according to one theory.   [Checkpoint inhibitor helps melanoma patients survive longer ]   Another kind of immunotherapy, called   cell therapy, is being widely tested in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common and once universally fatal childhood cancer. It has shown extraordinary effectiveness in treating recurrent disease.  By contrast, checkpoint inhibitors in children “may not be the home run they are in adults,” said Crystal Mackall, head of the cancer immunology and immunotherapy program at the Stanford University School of Medicine. “But it's too early to know. ”  The Oyelola family lives in a comfortable house in a gated community in Prince George's County, with a back yard big enough to accommodate pony rides on special occasions. Eden, who is obsessed with unicorns, has a    sister, Sade, and an    brother, Tobi. “He chases me, then I chase him,” Eden said on a recent afternoon as the children raced around. Dressed in a shirt decorated with lions, tigers and zebras, she showed little sign of being sick, other than a little puffiness in her face and slightly shorter hair where she had surgery.     Eden and her sister, Sade, 7, look at a picture book of animals and insects as they play in their home in Upper Marlboro, Md. (Michael S.   Washington Post)  Eden's father is a consultant for Ernst & Young whose parents came from Nigeria decades ago. Her mother is a native of Ethi o pia who moved to the USA as a little girl. A wall of photographs in the family room shows a handsome and happy family. On Halloween 2014, Oyelola remembers, “a new normal” took hold. Amare was driving their daughters home from a school parade  —   Eden had been dressed up as the country of Russia. Suddenly, Sade cried from the back seat: “Mommy, Eden is shaking!” Saliva foamed on her lips. Doctors at Children's diagnosed a febrile seizure, a   event in childhood. But several weeks later, another seizure followed. This time, Children's did a scan. “We see a mass,” the doctors told Amare. Brain surgery was scheduled for Christmas Eve. Eden's family decorated her   room with lights, wreaths and a tree. When she woke up on Christmas, she was amazed by the presents, sneaked in by nurses, and by a visit from Santa Claus himself. Those would be the only bright spots of the holiday. The ultimate diagnosis was that Eden had a “primitive, very rare, very unusual tumor,” Rood said, with many of the characteristics of glioblastoma. This deadly type of cancer arises from glia cells, which support brain function. Months of radiation and chemo followed, ending with the bell party in September 2015. Late last year, the    Foundation arranged for the family to go on an   scavenger hunt that culminated in a ride on a “unicorn” at Verizon Center. “Yes, it's a real unicorn!” Eden declared, caressing the big white horse.  The tumor's return in January was a crushing blow. Eden quickly had surgery and eventually entered a clinical study involving pomalidomide, a thalidomide derivative that is thought to interfere with tumor growth. She began getting violent headaches. “She could wake up in the morning and be hysterical for two hours,” her father said. And she was having three to four seizures an hour.    Eden's father, Toks Oyelola, wears a variety of inspirational wristbands. As her tumor grew, he pushed her doctors hard for treatment alternatives. (Michael S.   Washington Post)   The doctors took her off the medicine and talked to her parents about the immunotherapy trial and another operation. “It was ” Rood said. Yet they had no other options. In late May, Eden had her third surgery, which succeeded in sharply reducing the tumor and the swelling, and in easing her pain. A few days later, she celebrated her sixth birthday.  Not long after, she got a spot in the Children's trial.  Brain and    tumors are the    type of childhood cancers, after leukemia. A patient's prognosis depends on the type of malignancy, whether cancer cells remain after surgery and whether the tumor recurs.  Given the success seen with checkpoint inhibitors for some adult cancers, there is intense interest in trying them in brain tumors in patients of all ages. The hope is that the immune system will be effective at attacking the tumor and breaching the   barrier, a kind of security system that protects the brain yet also prevents many treatments from getting through. Several pediatric trials are underway or in development, including one trying a combination of checkpoint inhibitors that NY's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has set for next year.   [How cancer gets around the new immunotherapy drugs]   The    trial at Children's and other institutions is   by the National Cancer Institute and the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, a network of children's hospitals and academic medical centers that conducts   studies of novel treatments. Up to 70 patients will be enrolled, ages 1 to 21, with participants given infusions of Keytruda for 30 minutes every three weeks. The treatments are slated to extend over two years.    Sara Amare has relied on her faith during the nearly two years since her daughter Eden was diagnosed with cancer. (Michael S.   Washington Post)  Eugene Hwang, a pediatric   at Children's, and the other investigators are proceeding carefully because of the risks, frequently “pausing” the study to examine results and decide whether changes are needed. One of the toughest challenges in using checkpoint inhibitors or any immunotherapy for brain tumors, Hwang said, is figuring out how to produce the right level of immune response. Too weak and it won't affect the tumor. But too strong and the swarm of T cells could trigger lethal swelling.  “I have desperation in my back yard, where kids are dying, and there's hope the next yard over, where adults who have failed trial after trial are surviving,” said Hwang, the study chairman. “There is nothing that is going to dissuade me from trying something that has really revolutionized care for many adults. ”  Eden got her first dose of Keytruda on June 22, and everything seemed fine for the first two weeks. But shortly before her planned second dose, she again began having headaches, and numbness in her left arm. An MRI showed that the mass in her head had doubled in size in barely a month. That raised a critical issue for her physicians: Did the larger mass mean the drug had triggered the robust immune response they wanted? Or was the treatment failing and the cancer's growth accelerating? Or some combination of both? It was impossible to tell from the scan. Yet the answer would determine whether Eden could continue in the trial. The doctors delayed the second dose and gave her steroids to reduce the brain swelling. That effectively negated the effects of the immunotherapy, but it was the only way to figure out what was happening as they chose how to proceed. Her family tried to carry on with life. They all took a vacation to the beach, making sure they visited Assateague Island to see the wild ponies. Eden seemed to be doing well, and her parents were increasingly sure she would soon get her second Keytruda dose. But on July 28, she awoke in intense pain and was rushed the 20 miles to Children's. The tumor had gotten significantly bigger in just a few weeks and was starting to push the brain from the right side of her head toward the left. Blood and fluid also appeared to be leaking into the space between the brain and the skull. Doctors treated Eden with high levels of painkillers and higher levels of steroids. And they sat down with her parents. Rood told them that the tumor's fast growth was making it impossible for Eden to stay on the trial. Take her home, Rood suggested, and make her as comfortable as possible. “I can't accept that,” Amare said later, even as she talked about going “the God route. ” At her request, pastors from her Ethio pian Orthodox church have come to pray for her daughter.  Her husband is similarly torn. The doctors, he said, “don't expect a miracle to happen. But I do. ” Eden still romps through the house and plays with her dogs, Winter and Summer. On a recent afternoon, bored for the moment, she climbed onto her father's lap and whispered in his ear to take her to Target. She wanted to get more Twozies to add to her already sizable collection of the toy babies and pets. “Okay,” Oyelola said with a smile. “Let's go. ” ",False,"      Bald but beaming,    Eden Oyelola yanked the long rope to ring the victory bell at Children's National Medical Center last September. She was finally done with her treatment for brain cancer     surgery followed by months of radiation and chemotherapy that made her terribly ill. At a bell party at her home in Upper Marlboro, Md. later that week, she gobbled down ice cream with friends and rode a pony around the back yard. Her parents exhaled in relief. We thought she was in the clear, her father said. The relief was  . In January, the little girl who loved gymnastics started having seizures and losing control of her left side. She frequently stumbled. What's wrong with my legs? she asked. A second surgery followed after an MRI showed that the tumor had returned, forcing her doctors at Children's to ask whether there was anything else that would give Eden a chance to survive.

","    Florida is about to experience its first landfalling hurricane in more than a decade. The National Hurricane Center announced on Thursday afternoon that Hermine, previously a tropical storm, attained hurricane intensity at 2:55 p. m. Eastern Thursday. At the same time, radar imagery revealed an eye emerging at the center of the storm, a telltale indicator that a hurricane was developing. Intense bands of wind and rain were already lashing Florida's Gulf Coast from Tampa to Panama City. Florida has not experienced hurricane conditions since 2005 during Hurricane Wilma. In fact, the entire Gulf of Mexico hasn't had a hurricane since Ingrid in 2013. A hurricane warning is in effect for Florida from the Suwannee River to Mexico Beach. The center of Hermine could make landfall anywhere between those locations. A dangerous storm surge is possible as the storm rolls ashore on Thursday night  —   particularly on the south side of the storm  —   and flooding will be exacerbated by heavy rain. A storm surge warning is in effect from Franklin County through Hernando County. The highest surges are expected in coastal Wakulla, Jefferson and Taylor counties, and could reach 6 to 7 feet in the most vulnerable locations.      The timing of the tides will determine which locations get the worst impacts from storm surge. Unlike Sandy in 2012, which arrived precisely at one of the highest astronomical tides of the year, Hermine should make landfall near low tide in Apalachicola, Fla. which reduces the net water level by about 1. 2 feet. But in Cedar Key, roughly 150 miles farther down the coast, the storm is expected to make landfall closer to high tide when the water level is about 3. 2 feet higher than at low tide. Some of Apalachicola's worst storm surge events include Hurricane Dennis in 2005 and Hurricane Elena in 1985, and Hermine's surge could rival the surge produced by Category 3 Hurricane Dennis, which hit near Pensacola.      People on Florida's Gulf Coast boarded up windows and nailed plywood across shop fronts on Sept. 1 as they braced for Hurricane Hermine to make landfall on Thursday evening. (AP)   Another major threat facing north Florida and the Southeast USA in the coming hours and days is inland flooding caused by excessive rainfall. Through Sunday morning, a vast swath of the Big Bend and panhandle will get over six inches of rain. Some isolated areas could see more than 10 inches, especially where heavy rain bands form. After passing over Florida, Hermine will track along the East Coast, bringing heavy rain to Georgia and the Carolinas. How far inland the storm tracks is still a question mark until the center passes through Florida and back over water in the Atlantic.     rainfall forecast, valid from Thursday morning through Sunday morning.

Until yesterday, Aguilar was a prominent surrogate for Trump. But Trump delivered a hardline speech on immigration last night, and now top Latino supporters like Aguilar are bolting. Aguilar, who has been in regular touch with members of the National Hispanic Advisory Committee for Trump, a group formed by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, tells me that he expects as many as a half a dozen members of the Committee to step down or otherwise withdraw their support. The speech and fallout, said Aguilar, the head of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, are “a debacle for the Trump campaign. ” Latino conservatives thought there was a real chance that Trump might genuinely moderate on the issue, Aguilar said, perhaps by declaring himself open to some form of expedited path to legal status for those undocumented immigrants who leave the country and return. But in his speech last night, Trump flatly ruled out any such expedited pathway. To Latino conservatives, there is no doubt about the true intentions of Trump's speech, even though there are still a few observers here and there who continue to suggest that he somehow softened his approach yesterday. Trump stopped using the words “deportation force,” but he nonetheless made it absolutely clear that maximum deportations and stepped up enforcement are his guiding priorities, and also left no doubt that there simply isn't any meaningful path to assimilation in Trump's vision. “He means, We're gonna start detaining people, left and right,” Aguilar said, adding that Trump's vision was akin to “putting ICE on steroids” and creating “a deportation regime with close collaboration with state and local police. ” Aguilar added, however, that he would not be supporting Clinton. Massey Villarreal, a   businessman who was also a member of the Trump advisory committee, has pulled his support, too. “He will not be supporting Trump, and he will not be supporting Clinton,” Villarreal's assistant told me. He told NBC Latino that Trump's speech was “awful. ” Still another member of the Trump advisory committee, Jacob Monty, a   lawyer, longtime Republican, and   Mexican American, told my Post colleagues Aaron Blake and Jenna Johnson that he had attended a meeting with Trump at which he seemed reasonable on immigration. But after Trump's speech, he feels that he was misled, and has now decided he's done: “The speech was just an utter disappointment,” Monty said in an interview on Thursday  …    . “We were out there defending him. And then to be just lied to like that  —   it doesn't feel good. It's not okay. ” Politico reports that another member of Trump's advisory council, Ramiro Pena, a pastor, has also pulled out: “I am so sorry but I believe Mr. Trump lost the election tonight,” said Pena, a pastor at Waco's Christ the King Church. “The ‘National Hispanic Advisory Council' seems to be simply for optics and I do not have the time or energy for a scam. ”  In his interview with me, Aguilar suggested that this really is the stuff of nightmares for the Republican National Committee. As you'll recall, the RNC put out that autopsy after the 2012 election, concluding that the party must broaden its appeal by supporting immigration reform and taking genuine steps to be more welcoming to Latino immigrants. Surrogates such as these are central to these types of outreach efforts, because they embody the case that the conservative agenda holds promise for Latinos.

289,143544,214885,Georgetown plans to apologize for its role in slavery,Washington Post,Nick Anderson,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160902000145/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/09/01/georgetown-panel-urges-university-to-apologize-for-its-role-in-slavery/
","         Georgetown University plans to offer an apology for its participation in the institution of slavery, officials said, following the release of a report Thursday that scrutinized the sale of hundreds of   slaves in the early 19th century for the benefit of the Catholic school. In addition, the highly selective university in the nation's capital plans to give the descendants of slaves owned by Maryland Jesuits a boost in admissions, treating applicants from that community the same as it would those who are children of faculty, staff and alumni. And it will name a university residence hall after one of the slaves, a man named Isaac. He was 65 years old in 1838 when he and 271 other slaves were sold and shipped to a Louisiana plantation. Those are among several steps Georgetown is taking in response to a report from a panel of faculty, staff, students and alumni that examined the university's ties to slavery, including the 1838 sale. That transaction helped pay off debt at the Jesuit school then known as Georgetown College.   [Maryland Jesuits grateful for Georgetown slavery report]   Two Jesuit priests who took turns as president of Georgetown in those years, the Rev. Thomas Mulledy and the Rev. William McSherry, orchestrated the 1838 sale, for a price of $115, 000, or $3. 3 million today. The sale, which stirred debate at the time within the Society of Jesus, led to the shipment of slaves to Louisiana plantations, separating families. The episode has been known to scholars for decades. But it has drawn new attention in the past year amid an intensive dialogue about race relations on college campuses across the country. The panel, which Georgetown President John J. DeGioia convened a year ago, studied the sale and other issues connected to Georgetown and slavery. It said in its report to DeGioia that “a formal, spoken apology” would be appropriate “because its absence rings so loudly. ” “The University, despite the many ways that it has invested resources over the past half century to heal the wounds of racial injustice, has not made such an apology,” the report continued. “While there can be empty apologies, words of apology, genuinely expressed, make a difference in the quest for reconciliation. ” The report and the university's response drew emotional reactions from people who trace their lineage to those sold in 1838. Jessica Tilson, 34, a student at Southern University in Louisiana, said she was especially moved by the university's decision to dedicate one of its buildings to the memory of Isaac. Tilson said she is descended from him. Tilson was driving her mother to work Thursday when she got an email from Georgetown with news of the report. She said she burst into tears, pulled into a gas station parking lot and told her mother. They cried together, and talked about how they would tell Tilson's    grandfather. “I love the idea  —   all of it,” Tilson said. “Especially the name of the buildings. Isaac is my sixth great grandfather   …     When people name buildings after people, it shows how much you value them and respect them  …    . That means millions of children that come to that school for an education will learn about him. That is  —   I'm speechless. There are no feelings in the world that can describe how that feels. ” With the report, Georgetown joins a growing number of prominent colleges and universities that are giving new scrutiny to their various connections to the institution of slavery in America from colonial times through the Civil War. Brown University acknowledged its close ties to the   transatlantic slave trade in a groundbreaking 2006 report. The University of Virginia's governing board voted in 2007 to express regret for the use of slaves at the school Thomas Jefferson founded in 1819, a decade after the   Founding Father ended his second term as president. Georgetown, founded in 1789, is now revisiting its own deep entanglement with slavery, a story broader than the infamous 1838 sale. DeGioia, president of Georgetown since 2001,  in recent months has reached out personally to descendants of slaves the Jesuits sold in a quest to make amends for the actions of his predecessors. He met in June with descendants in Spokane, Wash. and in New Orleans, BatonRouge and elsewhere in Louisiana  —   40 to 50 in all, he said.   [Georgetown's priests sold her ancestors]      Patricia   meets John J. DeGioia, president of Georgetown University, in Spokane, Wash. in June.   is a descendant of slaves who were sold by Georgetown in 1838. (Jerry Johnson)  “We want to embrace them as members of our family,” DeGioia said in an interview Wednesday. DeGioia said he encountered “kindness and hospitality” as he expressed “a sincere desire on the part of the university to engage with them in a spirit of seeking reconciliation. ” Asked whether he had apologized to the descendants he met, DeGioia said that had not been his objective in the meetings. Instead, he said he wanted to introduce himself and begin a dialogue, even as he conveyed a sense of contrition for the university's actions. He also sought to place the issue in a wider context. As a nation, DeGioia said, “we're still coping with our failure to address the original evil of slavery. ” University officials indicated through a written statement Thursday that an apology is planned, one that will be “informed through the Catholic tradition,” including a Mass of Reconciliation to be held with the Archdiocese of Washington and the Society of Jesus in the USA. Read the panel's report here: Report presented to the president of Georgetown University  The Rev. David J. Collins, an associate professor of history who chaired the panel, said the members were clear that a full and formal apology was necessary. “Of course we want to say it,” Collins said in an interview. “What do you say to people, you know? You say, ‘I am sorry.' ” Over the past year, Georgetown has kept the Jesuits apprised of the panel's work. “As we have stated on other occasions, we deeply regret that part of our history,” a representative of the Jesuits, the Rev. James J. Miracky, said Thursday, speaking about the order's involvement with slavery. Miracky is the higher education liaison for the Maryland and Northeast provinces of the Jesuits. “It's important to embrace our past, to come to understand it and to be sorry for it,” he said. Miracky said the Jesuits, like Georgetown, are seeking to engage with the slave descendant community. Georgetown is one of a small group of schools that pledge to be “ ” in making admission decisions and meet the full need of all who enroll. It does not offer merit scholarships or other financial aid that is not based on need. Any aid program targeting the descendants of slaves would have to fit within those guidelines. The report is a milestone for the school of 18, 500 students that ranks among the nation's elite. Georgetown, like many prominent colleges, was long an   bastion. Its first African American students were enrolled in the university's law school in 1948, and its first African American undergraduate matriculated in 1950. Today about 6 percent of Georgetown's 7, 500 undergraduates are African American. Eight percent are Latino, 10 percent are Asian American and 4 percent are multiracial. The release culminated nearly a year of work by the   panel named the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation. At a little more than 100 pages, the report summarizes the close relationship between Maryland Jesuits, slavery and the college. The Jesuits, through colonial land grants, established plantations and began using slave labor on them around 1700. Those plantations became an enduring source of financial support for Georgetown, founded in 1789 as the first Catholic college in the newly independent nation. The college's founder, the Rev. John Carroll, who was the first bishop in the USA, owned at least one slave, whom he freed in his will. William Gaston, the college's first student, owned perhaps as many as 40 slaves but also supported the abolition of slavery on a number of occasions in public venues. The report notes that the “general attitude of Jesuit faculty and students favored slavery as at least a necessary evil” and that through the Civil War “the mood at the College was   and ultimately  . ” Most Georgetown alumni who fought in the war were in the rebel armies. Preliminary research suggests that there were more slaves on Georgetown's campus than previously thought, the report said. Some were brought by students. Some were rented from slave owners in the port of Georgetown, a hub of commerce for the slave society of Washington. The best estimate of the share of people on campus who were enslaved in the early 19th century is about 10 percent. All of that provides context for the sale of   slaves in 1838 and on other occasions. According to the report, Mulledy and McSherry organized the sale of 272 slaves to Louisiana businessmen while the former was college president and the latter held the title of superior of the Maryland Province of the Jesuits. The two priests swapped roles by the time the sale occurred. The slaves were taken from Maryland to various plantations in the Pointe Coupee, Iberville and Ascension parishes of Louisiana. Many were then sold and resold. The tragedy that befell those slaves is hardly unique. But the sale was one of the   of its kind in American history because the Jesuits kept meticulous records, many of them now at Georgetown's Lauinger Library. Exactly how much money from the sale came to Georgetown, and when, is uncertain. “We need to hammer this down a little bit more,” Collins said. “They certainly didn't get it all at once. ” But it is clear that $17, 000 from a down payment was used to pay down a Georgetown building debt, which translates to about $500, 000 today. What is also clear is that there was controversy over the sale within the Jesuit community at the time. Jesuit authorities in Rome were initially inclined to support emancipation, the report said, and they imposed several conditions on any sale, including a mandate that slave families should not be divided. That condition and others were not honored. In the aftermath, Mulledy was forced to resign as head of Jesuits in the USA and travel to Rome to avoid being dismissed from the order. Eventually he returned to become the first president of the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts, and he later served another term as president of Georgetown. Until last year, Mulledy and McSherry were honored at Georgetown through the usual way on a college campus: Two buildings were named for them. But as the university began to revisit the slave sale, a movement emerged last fall to improve the racial climate on college campuses around the country. Students at Georgetown held a   outside DeGioia's office in November to protest the Mulledy and McSherry building names and other issues.    About 30 students occupied a hallway in front of the office of John J. DeGioia, president of Georgetown, on Nov. 13. Demonstrators expressed solidarity with other student protests against racial discrimination and demanded that Mulledy Hall on campus be renamed. (Astrid Riecken for The Washington Post)  Soon afterward, the university removed plaques bearing the names and gave the buildings temporary names: Freedom Hall and Remembrance Hall.   [Georgetown to rename two buildings connected to slavery]   The panel's report recommended two permanent names for the buildings. The building once known as Mulledy Hall, now called Freedom Hall, should be renamed Isaac Hall, the report said, to honor the first of the 272 slaves listed in the articles of agreement for the 1838 sale. The other, once known as McSherry Hall and now called Remembrance Hall, should be renamed Anne Marie Becraft Hall, the report said, to honor a free woman of color of that name, “a trailblazing educator” who had roots in the Georgetown neighborhood in the 19th century. DeGioia said Georgetown's governing board approved the renaming of the two halls in July, and the school expects to move quickly to put that into motion. Among the panel's other recommendations:  Engage with the community of Maryland Jesuit slave descendants. Possible measures would be to support genealogical research, commission an oral history project, hold public events to tell the story of Jesuit slave holding and solicit input from descendants on a memorial for the people sold in 1838. Develop a public memorial to slaves and their families outside the two renamed halls, with names of the 272 preserved either as part of the memorial or inside the halls. Create an Institute for the Study of Slavery and its Legacies at Georgetown. Take other steps to publicize the school's history, including a historical walking tour of black Georgetown. Invest in diversity at Georgetown. One possible measure could be intensified recruiting of African American students, especially from Maryland, D. C. and Louisiana.  DeGioia said he is adamant that the panel's report should not be interpreted as a step toward closure of the issues. “Quite the contrary,” he said. “What we've been able to do is develop a road map to open up Georgetown to be a university in new kinds of ways. ”",False,"         Georgetown University plans to offer an apology for its participation in the institution of slavery, officials said, following the release of a report Thursday that scrutinized the sale of hundreds of   slaves in the early 19th century for the benefit of the Catholic school. In addition, the highly selective university in the nation's capital plans to give the descendants of slaves owned by Maryland Jesuits a boost in admissions, treating applicants from that community the same as it would those who are children of faculty, staff and alumni. And it will name a university residence hall after one of the slaves, a man named Isaac. He was 65 years old in 1838 when he and 271 other slaves were sold and shipped to a Louisiana plantation. Those are among several steps Georgetown is taking in response to a report from a panel of faculty, staff, students and alumni that examined the university's ties to slavery, including the 1838 sale. That transaction helped pay off debt at the Jesuit school then known as Georgetown College.   [Maryland Jesuits grateful for Georgetown slavery report]   Two Jesuit priests who took turns as president of Georgetown in those years, the Rev. Thomas Mulledy and the Rev. William McSherry, orchestrated the 1838 sale, for a price of $115, 000, or $3. 3 million today. The sale, which stirred debate at the time within the Society of Jesus, led to the shipment of slaves to Louisiana plantations, separating families. The episode has been known to scholars for decades. But it has drawn new attention in the past year amid an intensive dialogue about race relations on college campuses across the country. The panel, which Georgetown President John J. DeGioia convened a year ago, studied the sale and other issues connected to Georgetown and slavery. It said in its report to DeGioia that a formal, spoken apology would be appropriate because its absence rings so loudly.  The University, despite the many ways that it has invested resources over the past half century to heal the wounds of racial injustice, has not made such an apology, the report continued. While there can be empty apologies, words of apology, genuinely expressed, make a difference in the quest for reconciliation.  The report and the university's response drew emotional reactions from people who trace their lineage to those sold in 1838. Jessica Tilson, 34, a student at Southern University in Louisiana, said she was especially moved by the university's decision to dedicate one of its buildings to the memory of Isaac. Tilson said she is descended from him. Tilson was driving her mother to work Thursday when she got an email from Georgetown with news of the report. She said she burst into tears, pulled into a gas station parking lot and told her mother. They cried together, and talked about how they would tell Tilson's    grandfather. I love the idea     all of it, Tilson said. Especially the name of the buildings. Isaac is my sixth great grandfather        When people name buildings after people, it shows how much you value them and respect them      . That means millions of children that come to that school for an education will learn about him. That is     I'm speechless. There are no feelings in the world that can describe how that feels.  With the report, Georgetown joins a growing number of prominent colleges and universities that are giving new scrutiny to their various connections to the institution of slavery in America from colonial times through the Civil War. Brown University acknowledged its close ties to the   transatlantic slave trade in a groundbreaking 2006 report. The University of Virginia's governing board voted in 2007 to express regret for the use of slaves at the school Thomas Jefferson founded in 1819, a decade after the   Founding Father ended his second term as president. Georgetown, founded in 1789, is now revisiting its own deep entanglement with slavery, a story broader than the infamous 1838 sale. DeGioia, president of Georgetown since 2001,  in recent months has reached out personally to descendants of slaves the Jesuits sold in a quest to make amends for the actions of his predecessors. He met in June with descendants in Spokane, Wash. and in New Orleans, BatonRouge and elsewhere in Louisiana     40 to 50 in all, he said.

DeGioia, president of Georgetown University, in Spokane, Wash. in June.   is a descendant of slaves who were sold by Georgetown in 1838. (Jerry Johnson)  We want to embrace them as members of our family, DeGioia said in an interview Wednesday. DeGioia said he encountered kindness and hospitality as he expressed a sincere desire on the part of the university to engage with them in a spirit of seeking reconciliation.  Asked whether he had apologized to the descendants he met, DeGioia said that had not been his objective in the meetings. Instead, he said he wanted to introduce himself and begin a dialogue, even as he conveyed a sense of contrition for the university's actions. He also sought to place the issue in a wider context. As a nation, DeGioia said, we're still coping with our failure to address the original evil of slavery.  University officials indicated through a written statement Thursday that an apology is planned, one that will be informed through the Catholic tradition, including a Mass of Reconciliation to be held with the Archdiocese of Washington and the Society of Jesus in the USA. Read the panel's report here: Report presented to the president of Georgetown University  The Rev. David J. Collins, an associate professor of history who chaired the panel, said the members were clear that a full and formal apology was necessary. Of course we want to say it, Collins said in an interview. What do you say to people, you know? You say, I am sorry.'  Over the past year, Georgetown has kept the Jesuits apprised of the panel's work. As we have stated on other occasions, we deeply regret that part of our history, a representative of the Jesuits, the Rev. James J. Miracky, said Thursday, speaking about the order's involvement with slavery. Miracky is the higher education liaison for the Maryland and Northeast provinces of the Jesuits. It's important to embrace our past, to come to understand it and to be sorry for it, he said. Miracky said the Jesuits, like Georgetown, are seeking to engage with the slave descendant community. Georgetown is one of a small group of schools that pledge to be   in making admission decisions and meet the full need of all who enroll. It does not offer merit scholarships or other financial aid that is not based on need. Any aid program targeting the descendants of slaves would have to fit within those guidelines. The report is a milestone for the school of 18, 500 students that ranks among the nation's elite. Georgetown, like many prominent colleges, was long an   bastion. Its first African American students were enrolled in the university's law school in 1948, and its first African American undergraduate matriculated in 1950. Today about 6 percent of Georgetown's 7, 500 undergraduates are African American. Eight percent are Latino, 10 percent are Asian American and 4 percent are multiracial. The release culminated nearly a year of work by the   panel named the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation. At a little more than 100 pages, the report summarizes the close relationship between Maryland Jesuits, slavery and the college. The Jesuits, through colonial land grants, established plantations and began using slave labor on them around 1700. Those plantations became an enduring source of financial support for Georgetown, founded in 1789 as the first Catholic college in the newly independent nation. The college's founder, the Rev. John Carroll, who was the first bishop in the USA, owned at least one slave, whom he freed in his will. William Gaston, the college's first student, owned perhaps as many as 40 slaves but also supported the abolition of slavery on a number of occasions in public venues. The report notes that the general attitude of Jesuit faculty and students favored slavery as at least a necessary evil and that through the Civil War the mood at the College was   and ultimately  .  Most Georgetown alumni who fought in the war were in the rebel armies. Preliminary research suggests that there were more slaves on Georgetown's campus than previously thought, the report said. Some were brought by students. Some were rented from slave owners in the port of Georgetown, a hub of commerce for the slave society of Washington. The best estimate of the share of people on campus who were enslaved in the early 19th century is about 10 percent. All of that provides context for the sale of   slaves in 1838 and on other occasions. According to the report, Mulledy and McSherry organized the sale of 272 slaves to Louisiana businessmen while the former was college president and the latter held the title of superior of the Maryland Province of the Jesuits. The two priests swapped roles by the time the sale occurred. The slaves were taken from Maryland to various plantations in the Pointe Coupee, Iberville and Ascension parishes of Louisiana. Many were then sold and resold. The tragedy that befell those slaves is hardly unique. But the sale was one of the   of its kind in American history because the Jesuits kept meticulous records, many of them now at Georgetown's Lauinger Library. Exactly how much money from the sale came to Georgetown, and when, is uncertain. We need to hammer this down a little bit more, Collins said. They certainly didn't get it all at once.  But it is clear that $17, 000 from a down payment was used to pay down a Georgetown building debt, which translates to about $500, 000 today.

","     A few years ago, researchers from Indiana University discovered a disturbing pattern at the 2013 Swimming World Championships in Barcelona. According to the   data, athletes assigned to the outer lanes of the pool were consistently swimming faster in one direction than the other. A mysterious force seemed to be interfering with the competition. But before the researchers could investigate in person, the pool  —   a temporary facility constructed just for that event  —   was torn down. The same strange problem cropped up at the Rio Olympics, and nobody can explain why. Two independent statistical analyses show discrepancies large enough to cast doubt on the results of some races. The problem may have even cost swimmers medals.   [Why bronze medalists are happier than silver medalists, and other things the Olympics teaches us about human emotions]   The following chart  —   from Eastern Michigan University professor Andrew Cornett, and Indiana University's Christopher Brammer and Joel Stager  —   illustrates the lap time discrepancies in the Rio pool using data from the   races. Since competitors in those events make several laps back and forth along the    pool, the researchers could compare swimmers against themselves. Each dot represents a swimmer in one of the   and   races. The vertical position of the dot shows whether the athlete swam faster in one direction or the other.     In a perfectly fair pool, all of the dots should be near the zero line. In Rio, athletes in the middle lanes were relatively unaffected. But on the   side of the pool, competitors were about 0. 4 seconds faster swimming away from the starting blocks. The   side of the pool suffered from the opposite problem. Swimmers were about 0. 2 seconds slower in their outgoing laps compared to their return laps. (In all of this, the researchers ignored the first and last laps because those are strategic parts of the race.) To understand the pattern of lane bias, consider the example of Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen, who is marked on the chart in pink. In his preliminary heat for the   race, Christiansen was assigned to Lane 2. In that race, his outgoing laps were 0. 28 seconds faster than his incoming laps, on average. When Christiansen made it through to the final, he was assigned to the other side of the pool. In Lane 8, Christiansen swam a completely different race. His outgoing laps were slower than his incoming laps.     Could this have cost someone the gold? Because most Olympic events require athletes to swim an even number of laps, the effects of any currents in the water should have somewhat canceled out. Those who got a boost swimming in one direction would have to fight the same force when they turned around. The one exception is the   freestyle, which only covers a single length of the pool. Barry Revzin, a data analyst based in Chicago who used to swim competitively at MIT, found compelling evidence of the lane effect by comparing swimmers' times as they rose through the heats and  . He took advantage of the fact that athletes were typically assigned different lanes as they progressed through the competition. On average, Revzin found that swimmers raced faster when they moved to   lanes, and slower when they moved to   lanes. By Revzin's estimates, shifting two lanes to the right in the Rio pool would have given a swimmer a boost of about 1 centimeter per second. In a   freestyle race at Olympic pace, that translates to a difference of about   of a second.     As Revzin notes, this is a significant difference. In both the men's and the women's   freestyle, the top three finishers were separated by less than   of second. We'll never know for sure, but the evidence raises questions about what would have happened if people had gotten different lane assignments. For instance, the women's bronze medalist, Belarus's Aliaksandra Herasimenia clocked 24. 11 seconds. She beat out defending gold medalist Ranomi Kromowidjojo of the Netherlands, who clocked a 24. 19. But Herasimenia swam in Lane 8, which the data suggest was the fastest lane. Kromowidjojo swam in Lane 3. The Indiana University researchers' data led them to a similar finding: The   lanes in Rio, they determined, may have given the   swimmers a boost of up to 1 percent relative to the middle lanes. The   lanes may have slowed them down by up to 1 percent. Revzin, who calls himself a ”huge swimming fan,” said he was deeply disappointed when he noticed the discrepancies. ”Sadness was the main emotion,” he said. ”This is not the kind of thing you want to see in the biggest competition in your sport,” he said.

"," The Romanian hacker who first revealed that Clinton used a private email address while she was secretary of state was sentenced to more than four years in federal prison Thursday by a U. S. district judge in Alexandria, Va. Marcel Lehel Lazar, 44, known online as “Guccifer,” was extradited in 2014 to the USA and pleaded guilty in May to one count each of aggravated identity theft and unauthorized access to a protected computer. Lazar admitted to victimizing about 100 Americans from his home overseas over 14 months. They included celebrities, business executives and political figures such as Sidney Blumenthal, an adviser with whom Clinton corresponded using her personal email account; confidantes of former president George W. Bush; and former secretary of state Colin L. Powell. U. S. District Judge James C. Cacheris imposed a   sentence, saying a tough penalty was needed to deter future hacking. He cited reports of escalating cyber attacks against Americans in recent years, including this week's FBI warnings of intrusions into state election systems. “This epidemic must stop,” Cacheris said.

He also leaked pictures of Bush's paintings. “The extent of the harm caused by defendant's conduct is incalculable,” federal prosecutors wrote in seeking a maximum penalty of   years under U. S. sentencing guidelines. A maximum punishment “would also help address any false perception that unauthorized access of a computer is ever justified or rationalized as the cost of living in a wired society  —   or even worse, a crime to be celebrated,” Assistant U.

He was also motivated, Quill wrote, “to expose what he saw as hypocrisy, especially in those connected to the defense and intelligence sectors. ” A high school graduate, Lazar had no formal training or computer expertise.

In his 2014 interview, Lazar told FBI agents that he trawled more or less randomly through the online accounts of “important people,” looking for weak spots. He succeeded only about 8 to 10 percent of the time, he estimated.  Prosecutors argued that although Lazar confessed, he showed no remorse and probably will return to hacking. He was on probation for a hacking offense in Romania when he began targeting American celebrities in 2012 and has been sentenced to seven years in prison there. If he could go back in time and talk to his 2012 self, prosecutors say that he told one FBI agent, “I'd say, ‘All right, you have done a good job.' ” Cacheris said Romania's Justice Ministry requested that Lazar be immediately released to his home country to serve his time there and indicated that he would be conditionally released in 2018 and returned to the USA to serve his prison term here.

Fahrenthold,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160902000145/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/
","     Trump paid the IRS a $2, 500 penalty this year, an official at Trump's company said, after it was revealed that Trump's charitable foundation had violated tax laws by giving a political contribution to a campaign group connected to Florida's attorney general. The improper donation, a $25, 000 gift from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, was made in 2013. At the time, Attorney General Pam Bondi was considering whether to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University. She decided not to pursue the case. Earlier this year, The Washington Post and a liberal watchdog group raised new questions about the    gift. The watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, filed a complaint with the IRS  —   noting that, as a registered nonprofit, the Trump Foundation was not allowed to make political donations. The Post reported another error, which had the effect of obscuring the political gift from the IRS. In that year's tax filings, The Post reported, the Trump Foundation did not notify the IRS of this political donation. Instead, Trump's foundation listed a donation  —   also for $25, 000  —   to a Kansas charity with a name similar to that of Bondi's political group. In fact, Trump's foundation had not given the Kansas group any money. The prohibited gift was, in effect, replaced with an   but nonexistent donation. Trump's business said it was unaware of any of these mistakes until March, when it heard from the watchdog group and The Post. On Thursday, Jeffrey McConney  —   senior vice president and controller at the Trump Organization  —   said that after being notified, Trump filed paperwork informing the IRS of the political gift and paid an excise tax equal to 10 percent of its value. McConney said that Trump had also personally reimbursed the Trump Foundation for $25, 000, covering the full value of the improper gift. McConney blamed a series of mistakes, all of them unintentional. McConney said there had been no attempt to deceive. ”It was just an honest mistake,” McConney said. He added: ”It wasn't done intentionally to hide a political donation, it was just an error.” McConney said that he believed Trump had now done everything necessary to rectify the error. ”We've done what [we] were instructed to do,” he said.   [Inside The Post's search for evidence that Trump gives his own money to charity]   Trump started the Donald J. Trump Foundation in the late 1980s, to give away proceeds from his book, ”The Art of the Deal.” He remains the foundation's president, but  —   in recent years  —   Trump has stopped putting his own money into its coffers. Tax records show no gifts from Trump himself to the foundation since 1988; it has instead received donations from a smattering of Trump's friends and business associates.      Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi praised Republican presidential nominee Trump at the Republican National Convention. Bondi said foe Clinton's security clearance deserved to be taken away. (The Washington Post)   The Trump Foundation has no paid staff and relatively little money for a superwealthy man's personal charity: At the end of 2014, it had $1. 3 million in the bank. The foundation's giving is small and scattershot, with its gifts often sent to people whom Trump knows, or charities that hold their galas at his properties in NY and Florida. In this case, Trump staffers said that a series of unusual  —   and unrelated  —   errors by people working for Trump had led to both the improper donation and to the omission of that donation from the foundation's tax filings. The sequence began when Bondi herself solicited a donation from Trump. That solicitation was reported this year by the Associated Press. That request came as Bondi was considering allegations that Trump University  —   a real estate seminar business  —   had defrauded customers in Florida. Trump decided to give to the group connected to Bondi, called ”And Justice for All.” Then, a request for a check was sent to an   clerk at Trump's headquarters. This clerk was empowered to cut checks from both Trump's personal account and from the Trump Foundation. In most cases, political contributions were paid out of Trump's own account. But, in this case, that didn't happen. In March, Trump's chief financial officer told The Post that a mistake occurred when an accounting clerk  —   following office protocol  —   looked in a book that contained a list of all official charities. The clerk's standing order from Trump was that, if the payee was listed in this book of charities, the check should be paid from the Trump Foundation, not from Trump's own account. The clerk found a group called ”And Justice for All” listed in the book. The clerk cut the check from the Trump Foundation. But that was wrong. Trump's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, told The Post that the charity in the book was actually from Utah, and unconnected to Bondi. If the clerk had known that the check was meant for a political group, Weisselberg said, “we would have taken it out of [Trump's] own personal account. ” After that, a check from the foundation went out. It did not go to Utah but to Bondi's group in Florida, and was deposited. Then, when the Trump Foundation sent in its tax filings that year, it compounded the original error by leaving out any mention of a political gift. When the IRS form asked if the Trump Foundation had spent money for political purposes that year, the foundation wrote ”No.”    A section of the Trump Foundation's 2013 tax filing, in which the foundation said it had not engaged in political activity. In fact, it had sent a check to a political group in Florida, in violation of IRS rules.  Then, the Trump Foundation told the IRS about a gift that did not exist. The foundation told the IRS that it had given $25, 000 to a third group, a charity in Kansas with a similar name, ”Justice for All.” In fact, the Trump Foundation had not actually sent the Kansas group any money. This new, incorrect listing had the effect of camouflaging the prohibited gift. Trump's CFO said that the listing of the Kansas group was another mistake, made by the foundation's accountants.    An excerpt from the 2013 tax filings of the Donald J. Trump Foundation. The $25, 000 gift to ”Justice for All” did not exist. It took the place of a real $25, 000 gift that had violated IRS rules, because it went to a campaign group in Florida. The name of the group that got the prohibited gift: ”And Justice for All.”  The Post asked McConney, the Trump Organization controller, for a copy of the IRS form that Trump had filed along with his $2, 500 penalty tax. McConney said he would check to see if it could be released. The IRS declined to comment about the situation. But on Thursday, the liberal watchdog group said that the Trump Foundation needs to do more that it has. Under IRS rules, it appears that the Trump Foundation must seek to get the money back from the political group. Although Trump has apparently reimbursed the foundation, ”that's not the same,” said Jordan Libowitz, of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ”It's about getting the money back from the organization that wasn't allowed to have it in the first place.” So far, that hasn't happened. In fact, the treasurer of Bondi's political group said that she had actually tried to send the money back, without success. ”I wrote a check, sent it via FedEx. I received a call from the Trump Foundation, saying that they had declined to accept the refund,” said Nancy Watkins in an interview with The Post. She said this had happened in the spring, after she learned that the Trump Foundation was not allowed to make political gifts. Watkins said she was told, ”Mr. Trump had reimbursed the foundation with a personal check. And that was the end of it.”",False,"     Trump paid the IRS a $2, 500 penalty this year, an official at Trump's company said, after it was revealed that Trump's charitable foundation had violated tax laws by giving a political contribution to a campaign group connected to Florida's attorney general.

","         Trump's meeting with his Hispanic advisory council a couple of weeks ago left its members so excited that some even told reporters that Trump was about to significantly soften his approach to illegal immigration and maybe even embrace a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. Those advisers got a reality check Wednesday night, when Trump gave arguably his toughest speech on illegal immigration yet  —   promising a   crackdown and saying that every undocumented immigrant is subject to deportation. Now some of these Trump advisers, along with leading Hispanic Republicans who had been giving Trump a second look over the last two weeks, are renouncing him  —   and there are signs many more may follow.   [More than 6 million immigrants could be deported under latest Trump plan]   Jacob Monty, a   immigration attorney who is a third generation Mexican American and a longtime Republican, has now resigned from Trump's advisory council and withdrawn his support for Trump. In June, as Trump became the presumptive nominee, Monty wrote a column in the Houston Chronicle headlined: “A Latino's case for Trump. ” Monty said that he backed Trump  —   and started to help raise money for him  —   before he had fully firmed up his immigration stances. But Monty believed that a businessman would approach immigration from a business standpoint. Monty attended the Aug. 20 meeting at Trump Tower and said he was impressed that Trump talked about what to do with undocumented immigrants who have contributed to American society for years or decades. “He asked all of the right questions. He said all of the right things,” Monty said. “He brought it up.   …     By bringing it up, it told me that he was prepared to talk about it. That was music to my ears, for sure. ” Monty also thought Trump's remarks during a visit with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on Wednesday afternoon struck just the right tone. Monty agreed to go onto cable news shows and defend Trump, believing that the candidate had truly pivoted on this key issue. Then Trump took the stage in Phoenix. “The speech was just an utter disappointment,” Monty said in an interview on Thursday. He added in a Facebook post: “Tonight he was not a Republican but a populist, modern day Father [Charles] Coughlin who demonized immigrants. ” “I don't want to be a prop like the Mexican president,” Monty said in the interview. “We were out there defending him. And then to be just lied to like that  —   it doesn't feel good. It's not okay. ” Monty wasn't the only member of the advisory council to bolt. According to Politico, Texas pastor Ramiro Peña sent the Trump campaign an email saying the council basically amounted to a ”scam.” ”I am so sorry but I believe Mr. Trump lost the election tonight,” Peña said. ”The 'National Hispanic Advisory Council' seems to be simply for optics and I do not have the time or energy for a scam.” Another member, Massey Villarreal, told NBC Latino he was done, too. “As a compassionate conservative, I am disappointed with the immigration speech,” Villarreal said. “I'm going to flip, but not flop. I am no longer supporting Trump for president, but cannot with any conscience support Hillary [Clinton]. ” One Hispanic data analyst who has worked closely with Republicans, Leslie Sanchez, said she expects half the council to quit.   Hispanic leader who advises Trump camp telling me half of Trump's Hispanic advisory board is ready to resign today (15 of 30)  —   Leslie Sanchez (@LeslieSanchez) September 1, 2016   Other Hispanics who have gone to bat for Trump were disheartened. Alfonso Aguilar, the head of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles who has alternately been against Trump and then promoted his campaign as a surrogate, said he was finished with the Republicans nominee. ”I thought that we could work with him and the campaign to move him to the center on immigration, and the initial response was very good,” Aguilar said Thursday morning on CNN. ”And then we heard yesterday, and I was totally disappointed  —   not surprised, but disappointed  —   and slightly misled, because he gave the impression and the campaign gave the impression, till yesterday morning, that he was going to deal with the undocumented in a compassionate way.” Aguilar said Trump's speech was a new low. ”In that speech, he's basically saying: We'll deport you or we   you,” he said. ”It's even worse than what he initially proposed.” And some Hispanics who had been keeping an open mind about Trump as he appeared to soften his rhetoric in recent weeks recoiled after the speech. Bettina Inclán, a former director of Hispanic outreach at the Republican National Committee, went from ”hopeful” after Trump's Mexico visit to disenchanted after his speech.   I think this was a great move by #Trump, good speech. Strong step in the right direction. Now, how will he follow up? #TrumpInMexico  —   Bettina Inclán (@BettinaInclan) August 31, 2016     ughhh. ... I was so hopeful after the #TrumpInMexico trip. Please tell me this speech gets a bit better, give me something to work with Trump  —   Bettina Inclán (@BettinaInclan) September 1, 2016   Artemio Muniz, the chairman of the Texas Federation of Hispanic Republicans who has been a Trump skeptic but was willing to give him a chance on immigration, said Trump is doubling down on a bad strategy. ”I was not sure and I was going to leave my slate blank, but at this point, with what I heard last night, I can't support Trump,” Muniz said on CNN. ”I can't sell the product that he's trying to give to the Hispanic community.” Certainly, surrogates and advisers bolting from the campaign doesn't tell the whole tale. But the growing exodus suggests that the Hispanics watching Trump's moves on immigration the closest now feel betrayed, misled and alienated.

In June, as Trump became the presumptive nominee, Monty wrote a column in the Houston Chronicle headlined: A Latino's case for Trump.  Monty said that he backed Trump     and started to help raise money for him     before he had fully firmed up his immigration stances. But Monty believed that a businessman would approach immigration from a business standpoint. Monty attended the Aug. 20 meeting at Trump Tower and said he was impressed that Trump talked about what to do with undocumented immigrants who have contributed to American society for years or decades. He asked all of the right questions. He said all of the right things, Monty said. He brought it up.        By bringing it up, it told me that he was prepared to talk about it. That was music to my ears, for sure.  Monty also thought Trump's remarks during a visit with Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto on Wednesday afternoon struck just the right tone. Monty agreed to go onto cable news shows and defend Trump, believing that the candidate had truly pivoted on this key issue. Then Trump took the stage in Phoenix. The speech was just an utter disappointment, Monty said in an interview on Thursday. He added in a Facebook post: Tonight he was not a Republican but a populist, modern day Father [Charles] Coughlin who demonized immigrants.  I don't want to be a prop like the Mexican president, Monty said in the interview. We were out there defending him. And then to be just lied to like that     it doesn't feel good. It's not okay.  Monty wasn't the only member of the advisory council to bolt. According to Politico, Texas pastor Ramiro Pea sent the Trump campaign an email saying the council basically amounted to a scam. I am so sorry but I believe Mr. Trump lost the election tonight, Pea said. The 'National Hispanic Advisory Council' seems to be simply for optics and I do not have the time or energy for a scam. Another member, Massey Villarreal, told NBC Latino he was done, too. As a compassionate conservative, I am disappointed with the immigration speech, Villarreal said. I'm going to flip, but not flop. I am no longer supporting Trump for president, but cannot with any conscience support Hillary [Clinton].  One Hispanic data analyst who has worked closely with Republicans, Leslie Sanchez, said she expects half the council to quit.   Hispanic leader who advises Trump camp telling me half of Trump's Hispanic advisory board is ready to resign today (15 of 30)     Leslie Sanchez (@LeslieSanchez) September 1, 2016   Other Hispanics who have gone to bat for Trump were disheartened. Alfonso Aguilar, the head of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles who has alternately been against Trump and then promoted his campaign as a surrogate, said he was finished with the Republicans nominee. I thought that we could work with him and the campaign to move him to the center on immigration, and the initial response was very good, Aguilar said Thursday morning on CNN. And then we heard yesterday, and I was totally disappointed     not surprised, but disappointed     and slightly misled, because he gave the impression and the campaign gave the impression, till yesterday morning, that he was going to deal with the undocumented in a compassionate way. Aguilar said Trump's speech was a new low. In that speech, he's basically saying: We'll deport you or we   you, he said. It's even worse than what he initially proposed. And some Hispanics who had been keeping an open mind about Trump as he appeared to soften his rhetoric in recent weeks recoiled after the speech. Bettina Incln, a former director of Hispanic outreach at the Republican National Committee, went from hopeful after Trump's Mexico visit to disenchanted after his speech.   I think this was a great move by #Trump, good speech. Strong step in the right direction. Now, how will he follow up? #TrumpInMexico     Bettina Incln (@BettinaInclan) August 31, 2016     ughhh. ... I was so hopeful after the #TrumpInMexico trip. Please tell me this speech gets a bit better, give me something to work with Trump     Bettina Incln (@BettinaInclan) September 1, 2016   Artemio Muniz, the chairman of the Texas Federation of Hispanic Republicans who has been a Trump skeptic but was willing to give him a chance on immigration, said Trump is doubling down on a bad strategy. I was not sure and I was going to leave my slate blank, but at this point, with what I heard last night, I can't support Trump, Muniz said on CNN. I can't sell the product that he's trying to give to the Hispanic community. Certainly, surrogates and advisers bolting from the campaign doesn't tell the whole tale. But the growing exodus suggests that the Hispanics watching Trump's moves on immigration the closest now feel betrayed, misled and alienated. And if that extends to   Hispanics writ large, that's very bad for Trump."

The university made the announcement on Thursday when it posted the full list of its 2016 season promotions.

","     Last fall, the Navy Department had a controversial disciplinary case before it: Maj. Jason C. Brezler had been asked by Marine colleagues to submit all the information he had about an influential Afghan police chief suspected of abusing children. Brezler sent a classified document in response over an unclassified Yahoo email server, and he   the mistake soon after. But the Marine Corps recommended that he be discharged for mishandling classified material. The Navy Department, which oversees the Marine Corps, had the ability to uphold or overturn the decision. However, rather than just looking at the merits of the case, Navy officials also assessed that holding new hearings on the case would renew attention on the scandal surrounding child sex abuse in Afghanistan, according to military documents newly disclosed in federal court.   [Afghanistan sees rise in ‘dancing boys' exploitation]   The documents, filed Tuesday in a lawsuit by Brezler against the Navy Department and Marine Corps, also show that Marine and Navy officials in Afghanistan were aware in 2012 of allegations of abuse against children by the Afghan police chief but that the chief was allowed to keep his position in Helmand province anyway. This became a major issue after a teenage boy who worked for the chief  —   and allegedly was abused by him  —   opened fire on a U. S. base Aug. 10, 2012, killing three Marines and badly wounding a fourth. The   legal review, written last October by Lt. Cmdr. Nicholas Kassotis for Vice Adm. James W. Crawford III, the judge advocate general of the Navy, recommended that the Marine Corps' actions against Brezler be upheld. Calling for a new administrative review, known as a Board of Inquiry, would delay actions in the case another six to nine months and possibly increase attention on the case, “especially in the aftermath of significant media attention to the allegations regarding the practice of keeping personal sex slaves in Afghanistan,” Kassotis wrote. A month later in November, acting assistant Navy secretary Scott Lutterloh upheld the Marine Corps' decision.

A spokesman for the Justice Department, which is handling the lawsuit for the government, also declined to comment. The Navy Department's observation about Brezler's case was made as another U. S. service member's career was in jeopardy because of his response to alleged child sex abuse in Afghanistan. In that instance, Army Sgt. 1st Class Charles Martland made headlines after the Army decided last year to involuntarily separate him from the service because of a reprimand he had received for hitting an Afghan Local Police (ALP) official in 2011 after the man laughed about kidnapping and raping a teenage boy. The Army overturned its decision in April and allowed Martland, a Green Beret, to stay in the military after Rep. Duncan D. Hunter ( .) intervened. The Martland case opened a dialogue in which numerous veterans of the war in Afghanistan said they were told to ignore instances of child sex abuse by their Afghan colleagues.

[Pentagon watchdog to investigate allegations of Afghan child abuse]   Brezler's attorney, Michael J. Bowe, said Wednesday in an email that his client is entitled to a “real review” of his case  —   “not a whitewash designed to avoid uncomfortable press stories about child rape by our ‘partners' in Afghanistan. “Our service members deserve better,” he added. A spokesman for Hunter, Joe Kasper, said that the Navy Department is “right to be worried about granting Brezler a new, impartial review of his case” because it “can't sustain a case based on the facts and the moral imperative” that prompted Brezler to send the warning to other Marines that landed him in legal trouble. “The Navy surely watched the Army struggle with the Martland case, and the Army was ultimately left no choice but to retain Martland,” Kasper said. “The Brezler case is no different in that, at its foundation, there's a corrupt Afghan commander that exploits children. It's something that Americans won't tolerate, and good luck to the Navy as it tries to explain that Brezler was better to keep quiet, avoiding scrutiny altogether, than attempt to save several Marines that were killed. On that aspect alone, the Navy loses. ” Acting Defense Undersecretary Brian P. McKeon, said in a letter to Hunter last month that Gen. John “Mick” Nicholson, the top U. S. commander in Afghanistan, reaffirmed in May “tactical guidance” for U. S. troops that directs them to report potential instances of sex abuse to their commanders. “General Nicholson also issued a specific human rights policy directing further education of U. S. and coalition military personnel on their responsibilities to report human rights violations,” McKeon wrote. The Marines killed by the police chief's servant were Staff Sgt. Scott Dickinson, Cpl. Richard Rivera Jr. and Lance Cpl. Gregory Buckley. A fourth Marine suffered five gunshot wounds but survived. The teenager who killed them has been identified by the Marine Corps as Ainuddin Khudairaham.

297,143552,214894,Watch SpaceX's rocket explode in a massive fireball,Washington Post,Christian Davenport,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160902000145/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/01/space-x-explosion-rocks-launch-pad-at-cape-canaveral/
","         As SpaceX prepared to test fire the powerful engines of its Falcon 9 rocket, an explosion rocked its launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Thursday morning, blowing up the rocket, making it the second the company has lost in a fireball in just over a year. There were no humans on board, and no one was hurt. But the massive explosion could be felt for miles and a plume of dark, thick smoke hung over the coastline as emergency officials scrambled to assess the damage. The accident came at a pivotal moment for SpaceX, the upstart company founded by Elon Musk that has for years been flying commercial satellites to orbit and cargo to the International Space Station for NASA. Along with Boeing, SpaceX is now preparing to ferry astronauts for the first time to the station under a contract with NASA. The mission was slated to take place as soon as next year, but some officials say Thursday's explosion is likely to prompt new scrutiny. The explosion came on the same day a government watchdog reported that human flights to the station could be delayed because of technical issues with the companies' spacecraft designs.   [All the vehicles that will take you to space]   Last year, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket —  which would also be used to fly astronauts —  blew up a couple minutes after liftoff during a cargo mission. “This will always raise questions and possible delays, and certainly people redoubling their efforts on safety,” said Lori Garver, the former deputy NASA administrator.  The explosion occurred at 9:07 a. m. as SpaceX was preparing to test fire the rocket's engines ahead of the launch of a commercial satellite, reportedly valued at $195 million, that had been scheduled for early Saturday morning. The Falcon 9, towering some 230 feet high atop Launch Complex 40, was being fueled, when a fireball ignited around the upper stage oxygen tank, Musk said on Twitter. It was unclear what caused the mishap. Video of the incident shows a series of ignitions that engulfed the launch pad in flames.   [What the SpaceX rocket explosion means for NASA and human spaceflight]   In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, NASA officials said they ”remain confident in our commercial partners and firmly stand behind the successful 21st century launch complex that NASA, other federal agencies, and U. S. commercial companies are building on Florida's Space Coast.” Musk, the billionaire tech entrepreneur who also runs Tesla Motors, has laid out huge aspirations for his space company on an incredibly ambitious timeline. He plans to launch an uncrewed spacecraft in 2018 that would land on the surface of Mars, a planet he intends to colonize. At a space conference next month, he is scheduled to provide further details on how the company plans to get humans there by as early as 2025. The company also hopes to launch by the end of the year the Falcon Heavy, a much more powerful rocket than the one that exploded Thursday. And it plans to fly for the first time one of the rockets it had recovered earlier this year in a landing. But now SpaceX will be temporarily grounded while the investigation begins into what caused the explosion and repairs begin on the launch pad. After the explosion last June, SpaceX recovered quickly, returning to flight six months later. On that launch, it pulled off the first of its rocket landings. In an interview in June, Musk said that as it works to get to Mars, “we're going to make mistakes along the way. ” The company has enjoyed tremendous support from people inspired by its successes, but he said that“when we occasionally fall down, we want their support. . . Support us when the chips are down. Fair weather friends are easy to come by. But the ones that really matter are the ones that support you when the chips are down. ”   [Elon Musk provides new details on his ‘mind blowing' mission to Mars]   This year, the SpaceX successfully launched several more rockets, as it worked to churn through its growing backlog. And SpaceX was getting its momentum back, restoring confidence not just in the company, but in the notion that private companies, and not just governments, were capable of safely ferrying passengers to space. Garver, the former NASA deputy administrator, said that after NASA's setbacks, the country “continued to persevere, and I think in this case they will as well. ” She pointed out that NASA hired two companies —  SpaceX and Boeing —  to fly astronauts to the station so that it would have a backup in case something went wrong. “We were always aware that both companies could see setbacks,” she said.   [SpaceX says it will fly a spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018]   Separately on Thursday, NASA's Inspector General released a report that said NASA's “commercial crew” program to outsource human flights to the space station “continues to face multiple challenges,” this time because of concerns with the companies' spacecraft designs. The IG said the issues “will likely delay the first routine flight carrying NASA astronauts to the ISS until late 2018  —   more than 3 years after NASA's original 2015 goal. ” Given the delays, the report said that NASA has had to extend its contract with Russia, which currently flies U. S. astronauts to the station, through 2018 at an additional cost of $490 million. John Logsdon, the former director at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, said it was too early to say what the fallout of the explosion would be “because we don't know what happened or why it happened and how long it's going to be before they launch again. ” No matter what the cause, “it is certainly unfortunate for the broader future plans for SpaceX,” he said. Some in the space industry said they thought SpaceX could recover quickly, especially if the problem was not with the rocket.   [That SpaceX explosion blew up one of Facebook's most ambitious projects]   “We're disappointed by what happened,” said Eric Stallmer, the president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation. “But we're confident they'll find the root of the problem, and they'll be back to flying soon. ” In a statement, Sen. Bill Nelson ( .) said: “As we continue to push the frontiers of space, there will be both triumphs and setbacks. But at the end of the day, I'm confident that our commercial space industry will be very successful. ” The satellite that SpaceX was planning to launch Saturday was the   which would have been used in Facebook's first attempt to provide the Internet to rural areas from space.

[All the vehicles that will take you to space]   Last year, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket   which would also be used to fly astronauts   blew up a couple minutes after liftoff during a cargo mission. This will always raise questions and possible delays, and certainly people redoubling their efforts on safety, said Lori Garver, the former deputy NASA administrator.  The explosion occurred at 9:07 a. m. as SpaceX was preparing to test fire the rocket's engines ahead of the launch of a commercial satellite, reportedly valued at $195 million, that had been scheduled for early Saturday morning. The Falcon 9, towering some 230 feet high atop Launch Complex 40, was being fueled, when a fireball ignited around the upper stage oxygen tank, Musk said on Twitter. It was unclear what caused the mishap. Video of the incident shows a series of ignitions that engulfed the launch pad in flames.   [What the SpaceX rocket explosion means for NASA and human spaceflight]   In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, NASA officials said they remain confident in our commercial partners and firmly stand behind the successful 21st century launch complex that NASA, other federal agencies, and U. S. commercial companies are building on Florida's Space Coast. Musk, the billionaire tech entrepreneur who also runs Tesla Motors, has laid out huge aspirations for his space company on an incredibly ambitious timeline. He plans to launch an uncrewed spacecraft in 2018 that would land on the surface of Mars, a planet he intends to colonize. At a space conference next month, he is scheduled to provide further details on how the company plans to get humans there by as early as 2025. The company also hopes to launch by the end of the year the Falcon Heavy, a much more powerful rocket than the one that exploded Thursday. And it plans to fly for the first time one of the rockets it had recovered earlier this year in a landing. But now SpaceX will be temporarily grounded while the investigation begins into what caused the explosion and repairs begin on the launch pad. After the explosion last June, SpaceX recovered quickly, returning to flight six months later. On that launch, it pulled off the first of its rocket landings. In an interview in June, Musk said that as it works to get to Mars, we're going to make mistakes along the way.  The company has enjoyed tremendous support from people inspired by its successes, but he said thatwhen we occasionally fall down, we want their support... Support us when the chips are down. Fair weather friends are easy to come by. But the ones that really matter are the ones that support you when the chips are down.    [Elon Musk provides new details on his mind blowing' mission to Mars]   This year, the SpaceX successfully launched several more rockets, as it worked to churn through its growing backlog. And SpaceX was getting its momentum back, restoring confidence not just in the company, but in the notion that private companies, and not just governments, were capable of safely ferrying passengers to space. Garver, the former NASA deputy administrator, said that after NASA's setbacks, the country continued to persevere, and I think in this case they will as well.  She pointed out that NASA hired two companies   SpaceX and Boeing   to fly astronauts to the station so that it would have a backup in case something went wrong. We were always aware that both companies could see setbacks, she said.   [SpaceX says it will fly a spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018]   Separately on Thursday, NASA's Inspector General released a report that said NASA's commercial crew program to outsource human flights to the space station continues to face multiple challenges, this time because of concerns with the companies' spacecraft designs. The IG said the issues will likely delay the first routine flight carrying NASA astronauts to the ISS until late 2018     more than 3 years after NASA's original 2015 goal.  Given the delays, the report said that NASA has had to extend its contract with Russia, which currently flies U. S. astronauts to the station, through 2018 at an additional cost of $490 million. John Logsdon, the former director at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, said it was too early to say what the fallout of the explosion would be because we don't know what happened or why it happened and how long it's going to be before they launch again.  No matter what the cause, it is certainly unfortunate for the broader future plans for SpaceX, he said. Some in the space industry said they thought SpaceX could recover quickly, especially if the problem was not with the rocket.   [That SpaceX explosion blew up one of Facebook's most ambitious projects]   We're disappointed by what happened, said Eric Stallmer, the president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation. But we're confident they'll find the root of the problem, and they'll be back to flying soon.  In a statement, Sen. Bill Nelson ( .) said: As we continue to push the frontiers of space, there will be both triumphs and setbacks. But at the end of the day, I'm confident that our commercial space industry will be very successful.  The satellite that SpaceX was planning to launch Saturday was the   which would have been used in Facebook's first attempt to provide the Internet to rural areas from space.

","        Old family photographs on Marisa Vesco's bed. (Gaia  )  My grandmother's life and mine overlapped for 27 years. I always called her “Nonna. ” Our age difference and profoundly contrasting values and way of thinking did not prevent us from developing a strong bond and a relationship punctuated by mischievous games and moments of tenderness and humor. We were amused by our differences. “You know, I was still young when you were born,” she told me a few weeks before she died. “It's a little like we grew up together. ” At a lunch table a few months earlier in Milan, I learned from my mother, her daughter, that Nonna, 85, was suffering from incurable liver cancer. Years before, she had already survived two bouts of breast cancer. Nonna would tell me time and time again that the news of my birth had given her the strength to fight. When I learned that she was sick again, I had just landed in Italy, where I would be for only three days before flying back to NY.    Marisa Vesco eats breakfast in her bed. (Gaia  )     Marisa Vesco eats ice cream in her bed. (Gaia  )  Even more heartbreaking than the fear of saying goodbye to her was the fact that my grandmother did not know how sick she was. My mother and aunt believed she could not bear the thought of a third bout with cancer, this time affecting her liver. Nonna was told by family members that her liver was ill. No one ever mentioned the word “cancer. ” Because of this, one question haunted us until the day she died: Did we have the right to know the truth about her condition when she did not? Nonna spent most of her last months at home, surrounded by family. She reconciled with the idea of death and said she could slowly feel it coming. Doctors felt that surgery and chemotherapy would be pointless. In the midst of all this, I realized that my mother was losing her mother. After moving back to Italy for a few months, I witnessed the range of my mother's emotions and the energy she devoted to the time they had left together. Nonna's world shrank to a few walls and fewer streets. In this narrow existence, every detail and daily act took on deeper meaning. One of the things my mother treasured most was giving her mother a bath. She did not hesitate to touch her old body, and she did not want others to do it on her behalf.    Chiara Micheletti helps her mother Marisa Vesco take a shower. (Gaia  )  I joined my mother and grandmother in the bathroom to quietly observe them with my camera. As I experienced those precious moments, I imagined myself at an older age and thought about how time changes one's perspective on being a woman.

(Gaia  )  If you spoke with people in Nonna's town, they would say she never left the house without being enveloped in a cloud of perfume, her white hair perfectly coiffed and her face tinged with makeup. I was surprised by the way she confronted being ill without losing her femininity. She was able to poke fun at herself. More than once she asked me, “Am I going to end up on Vogue or Marie Claire?” On Oct. 11, 2015, the day Nonna died in Biella, Italy, I was across the world in Brooklyn, N. Y. I had spent five months with her, celebrating her life instead of mourning her death. I remember taking a walk through the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn and staring for a while at kids competing in a race. I was unable to come to terms with the fact she was no longer a part of the world around me. I struggled with the concept of death and the abstract emotion we call grief. I found peace only when I returned to Italy to spread Nonna's ashes. My family and I walked to Nonna's favorite place in the mountains not far from Cossato in northwestern Italy, the town in which she had grown up. Her ashes felt heavy in my hands. I threw them far up into the air, and they fell all over the grass, and all over me. My mother, brother and aunt did the same, again and again.

","     In the aftermath of Anthony Weiner s latest sext scandal, he found a surprising ally:Â Dan Savage. In a Monday interview, the sex columnist said that Weiner should be seen as  the victim of revenge porn, ? aÂ malicious act in which sexual photographs are shared without the consent of the subject, usually to humiliate or harm. Revenge porn (more accurately called involuntary or nonconsensual pornography) is now illegal in several states and, thanks to a bill that is currently in front of Congress, may soon be a federal crime. But when those laws were being crafted just a few years ago, Weiner was a frequently touted example of what revenge porn isn t.   [Opinion: Our gawking at Anthony Weiner reveals something ugly about us]   This was initially a debate over how broadly to write the    statutes. Arizona s statute was so broad that when the American Civil Liberties Union sued over it, and a court of law suspended its enforcement. California s first try at criminalizing revenge porn was too narrow, because it excluded selfies  ” which are, according to some estimates, actually the bulk of all involuntary pornography. But one point of contention that everyone kept looping back to was around one issue: newsworthiness.

","     As Labor Day approaches, and a single day of rest from all the hours we Americans spend on the job is upon us, people can't seem to stop talking about the crazy hours they work. One of the   articles on the Wall Street Journal's web site last week was a piece about how 4 a. m.    a time so ungodly there's even a TED Talk about how surreal it is    has become the most productive hour for  . Trump has been endlessly knocking Clinton for sleeping (gasp!) calling out her lack of stamina as he brags about not needing much sleep and his former staffers say that vacations would ”bore and perhaps scare” the Republicans presidential nominee. And then there is Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, who said in a recent Bloomberg BusinessWeek interview that she regularly pulled all nighters when she worked at Google and can judge a startup's chances for success by whether people are working on the weekends. ”Could you work 130 hours in a week?” Mayer said, referring to the value hard work played in Google's success. ”The answer is yes, if you're strategic about when you sleep, when you shower, and how often you go to the bathroom.”   [Working more than 55 hours a week is bad for you —  in many ways]   This has got to stop. No one, no matter what the upside may be, should have to be that strategic. The idea that being   could be a black mark against a leader is preposterous. And even if a super early   time works for some people    and they're sensitive about sending out email before dawn    if you're having to get up at 4 a. m. to avoid distractions in your day, there's probably something wrong with how we're working. Americans' weekly work hours, on average, actually fall somewhere in the middle of the pack among developed nations. But four in 10 of us don't use all the vacation time we're allotted    which is far less than it is in most countries. Researchers have looked at the Bureau of Labor Statistics' American Time Use Survey and found we're literally trading sleep for work. A Gallup poll found that 50 percent of people work more than 40 hours a week, and the average, nearly 47 hours a week in 2014, has been creeping up for years. The expectation of crazy hours is strong enough that one researcher found some men pretend to work an   week, even when they don't.   [How the new overtime rules could affect flexibility on the job]   Yet research, time and time again, shows the problems with overwork    on people's health, on turnover, on absenteeism, on productivity. Studies have shown that after about 50 hours a week, productivity actually decreases, and it plummets after 55 hours, leaving no detectable difference between those who work 56 hours and those who work 70    or 130, as Mayer suggested may be needed for successful startups. That's an absurd number of hours, translating into more than 18 hours a day of work, seven days a week. It's illogical, given the research. It's obviously unsustainable. And if that's how we're going to measure success in the workplace today, we're in big trouble. Some companies, of course, are looking for smart solutions. Aetna is paying workers up to $500 a year if they get 20 nights of at least seven hours of sleep in a row, using Fitbit devices to help them keep track. Boston Consulting Group has teams set aside ”predictable time off,” covering for each other so they can be available to both their clients and their families. And Amazon. com, which came under fire last year after a NY Times piece about its demanding work culture, will soon launch an experiment that sets up technical teams made up solely of   workers, earning benefits and salaries but at lesser pay. One key reason it could work: Managers of these teams will work just 30 hours a week, too. That could help prevent the ”hours creep” that typically happens when   workers, supervised by people who work much longer hours, try and limit their hours in a   work world. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)   [Amazon is piloting teams with a   workweek]   Managers, after all, are probably the biggest factor in changing our increasingly     world. If workers see people taking time off to coach their kid's soccer game, or leaving by 6 p. m. to have dinner at home, they'll feel entitled to do the same. But if they toil under someone who suggests that working on weekends is ”a huge indicator of success,” or that working 130 hours a week is possible, they may feel compelled to emulate them. Yes, success comes from hard work. And yes, CEOs paid millions of dollars or early startup employees who stand to reap huge rewards may choose to work   weeks. Entrepreneurs who can kick off at 3 p. m. if they start at 4 a. m. and aren't expected to show their face until rush hour starts may love their early morning routines. But they should be mindful that while oddball hours or absurdly long slogs at the desk may work for them, they also set an unattainable standard for many others.      ”There's no reason you are special because you happen to have this job,” the Unilever CEO tells The Post.

That's an absurd number of hours, translating into more than 18 hours a day of work, seven days a week. It's illogical, given the research. It's obviously unsustainable. And if that's how we're going to measure success in the workplace today, we're in big trouble. Some companies, of course, are looking for smart solutions. Aetna is paying workers up to $500 a year if they get 20 nights of at least seven hours of sleep in a row, using Fitbit devices to help them keep track. Boston Consulting Group has teams set aside predictable time off, covering for each other so they can be available to both their clients and their families. And Amazon. com, which came under fire last year after a NY Times piece about its demanding work culture, will soon launch an experiment that sets up technical teams made up solely of   workers, earning benefits and salaries but at lesser pay. One key reason it could work: Managers of these teams will work just 30 hours a week, too. That could help prevent the hours creep that typically happens when   workers, supervised by people who work much longer hours, try and limit their hours in a   work world. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)   [Amazon is piloting teams with a   workweek]   Managers, after all, are probably the biggest factor in changing our increasingly     world. If workers see people taking time off to coach their kid's soccer game, or leaving by 6 p. m. to have dinner at home, they'll feel entitled to do the same. But if they toil under someone who suggests that working on weekends is a huge indicator of success, or that working 130 hours a week is possible, they may feel compelled to emulate them. Yes, success comes from hard work. And yes, CEOs paid millions of dollars or early startup employees who stand to reap huge rewards may choose to work   weeks. Entrepreneurs who can kick off at 3 p. m. if they start at 4 a. m. and aren't expected to show their face until rush hour starts may love their early morning routines. But they should be mindful that while oddball hours or absurdly long slogs at the desk may work for them, they also set an unattainable standard for many others.      There's no reason you are special because you happen to have this job, the Unilever CEO tells The Post.

"," I am going to fill you in on a major secret of good nutrition: Healthier eating often has nothing to do with superfoods, metabolism or the perfect balance of nutrients, but rather with being prepared. That s right  ” just like the Boy Scouts. In this case, what we need to be prepared with is food that is in line with our values and health goals. We live fast lives, and most of us are tight on time. Often we don t eat right not because we don t think we need to or because we refuse to eat vegetables, but rather because we come home tired and hungry to an empty fridge. So we order something quick  ” and probably unhealthy  ” because it is easy and tasty. How can you prepare for this? The answer is batch cooking  ” cooking enough food at one time so you make two or three meals  worth of leftovers. You always have nutritious, homemade food on hand. Life gets easier, and your body gets healthier. It s truly that simple.   [ ? Healthy  sweeteners,   quinoa and other nutrition myths, debunked]  When you first start batch cooking, it will seem to take a lot of time, because you are prepping and cooking so much at once. However, the time you will save during the days that follow is tremendous. If you roast two to four sheets of vegetables on Sundays, you ve got those veggies all week. Stored in a container in your fridge, they can be eaten cold or reheated in seconds. Same with protein: Cook 10 chicken breasts, make a dozen burgers and   a dozen eggs, and you are set for protein when you walk in the door after a long day. This goes for starches as well. Make a big pot of quinoa, rice, beans, you name it, and daily portions are just waiting to be reheated. And don t forget to make use of your freezer, the ultimate weapon against food going bad. You can freeze cooked grains such as rice, bread and pasta, as well as cooked proteins and even vegetables. As you learn to master freezing foods and refrigerating them in airtight containers, you might be able to make enough in one   session to last as long as two weeks.   To be sure, a major problem many people have with batch cooking is they don t think they re getting enough variety in their meals. Repeating the same foods during the week can be boring. The solution is using spices, herbs and condiments to add variety. Protein one night can be made with salsa, cilantro and chilies; the next night, add olives, vinegar and rosemary; for lunch, add ketchup, mustard and pickles.
