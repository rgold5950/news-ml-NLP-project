After the attack, the first lady was airlifted to Miami, Fla., for treatment where she was in a stable condition, Joseph added.
The assassination was carried out by “well-trained professional commandos'” and “foreign mercenaries” who were masquerading as U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents, according to Bocchit Edmond, the Haitian ambassador to the U.S.
The DEA has an office in the Haitian capital to assist the government in counternarcotics programs, according to the U.S. Embassy.

A resident who lives near the president’s home  told the Associated Press  she heard the attack.
“I thought there was an earthquake, there was so much shooting,” the woman said, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she fears for her life. “The president had problems with many people, but this is not how we expected him to die. This is something I wouldn’t wish on any Haitian.”
Haiti’s police and army managed to track down the presumed assassins and were engaged in a fierce battle with them late on Wednesday night, officials said.
Four people suspected of being involved in the assassination were killed by police and two others were arrested, Haiti’s police chief said.
Charles added that three police officers who had been held hostage were freed.

WHAT NOW?

Moïse’s death has generated confusion about who is now the legitimate leader of the country of 11 million people, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic.
-

-

Though Moïse is dead, his party retains power. Joseph, appointed by Moïse on an interim basis as prime minister in April after the previous prime minister resigned, controls Haiti for now.
The 1987 constitution says the head of the supreme court should take over. Meanwhile, amendments that are not unanimously recognized say it should it be the prime minister, or the Parliament should elect a president.

There is no sitting Parliament as Haiti failed to hold legislative elections in late 2019 amid political unrest.
And Moïse had just this week appointed a new prime minister, Ariel Henry, to take over from interim prime minister Joseph, though he had yet to be sworn in when the president was killed.
Henry, however,  told Le Nouvelliste  that he did not consider Joseph the legitimate prime minister anymore and he should revert to the role of foreign minister.
“I think we need to speak. Claude was supposed to stay in the government I was going to have,” Henry was quoted as saying.

The United Nations Security Council was due to hold a closed-door meeting on the situation in Haiti on Thursday.
Since taking over, Joseph has also declared Haiti in a “state of siege” for 15 days. During this time, security forces have increased rights to conduct searches and seizures and to detain persons of interest. Some civil rights have also been suspended, including the right to protest and to hold large gatherings.
WHY WAS MOÏSE SO CONTROVERSIAL?

Moïse had been in office for four-and-a-half years before he was killed.
When he first took office, he pledged to strengthen institutions, fight corruption and bring more investment and jobs to the nation. However, critics accused him of growing increasingly authoritarian.

He said his five-year term was supposed to end in 2022. But his critics, including human rights groups and clergy members, insisted that his term was up this past February.
When he refused to vacate the presidency, protests swelled as many demanded his resignation. Moïse said he planned to modify the Haitian constitution to allow him to stay in office even longer.
Earlier this year, he dissolved the Parliament, saying most lawmakers’ terms had ended. He also forced three supreme court justices into early retirement.

Moise pursued sweeping constitutional changes that would increase presidential power. He planned a vote on a referendum, as well as his replacement, in September.
Moïse lost the trust of the Haitian people early, said Tamanisha John, a Caribbean studies scholar at Florida International University, in an interview with Reuters.

WHAT HAS CANADA, INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SAID?

The assassination drew shock and condemnation from leaders in Latin America, Europe and the U.S., along with calls for calm and unity in the troubled Caribbean nation.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined world leaders on Wednesday in condemning the assassination of Moïse.
In a statement  , Trudeau said he was shocked and saddened to learn of the assassination.
“We wish a full recovery to first lady Martine Moïse who was injured in the attack, and our thoughts are with her as she mourns the loss of her husband,” the statement read.

“It was a real shock because we didn’t expect that, and well, it was horrible because it’s not a very democratic way to get rid of a president,” said Marjorie Villefranche, the executive director of La Maison d’Haiti — a Haitian community group based in Montreal.
According to Villefranche, Moise’s assassination now leaves an even deeper vacuum in power and politics in a country already wracked by political and economic instability.

1,217419,@ChinaDailyApp,2016-09-01,"MEXICO CITY - Haitian police have arrested two of the gunmen who are suspected to have assassinated President Jovenel Moise early Wednesday, while four others were killed when apprehended by the authorities, said Leon Charles, director general of the National Police.
The police operation also led to the release of three police officers the gunmen had kidnapped in the attack at Moise's residence, Charles, accompanied by Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph and other officials, told the press.
The suspects were apprehended following an intense shootout with police in the upscale Pelerin district, where Moise's residence is located, ""shortly before 6 (pm) in the afternoon,"" Secretary of State for Communication Frantz Exantus said earlier via Twitter.
At the briefing, Minister of Culture and Communication Pradel Henriquez said the assailants are foreigners who speak Spanish and English, but did not provide details about their nationality or identity.
The interim prime minister stressed that the country's security situation was ""under control"" in the aftermath of the assassination.
He added that a forensic report was made on Moise's death and his body was then transferred to a morgue in the capital.
Regarding the state of health of the first lady, Martine Moise, who was injured in the attack, Joseph said she was ""out of danger"" after being transferred to a hospital in Miami, Florida.
""Fortunately, many sectors of the opposition condemned the murder,"" said Joseph, who hours earlier expressly asked the opposition to join in denouncing the assassination.

Four people suspected of being involved in the killing of Haiti’s President Jovenel Moise have been shot dead in a brutal shoot-out with police.
The president was assassinated in his home early Wednesday and his wife was wounded.
Four “mercenaries” were killed and two taken into custody, police said, adding that officers were conducting an operation in the capital Port-au-Prince.
“Four mercenaries were killed, two were intercepted under our control. Three policemen who had been taken hostage have been recovered,” said the director general of Haiti’s national police Leon Charles in a televised statement.
He said police pursued the assassins immediately after the attack on Mr Moise and his wife.
Haiti in ‘state of siege’
Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph has declared the nation is in a “state of siege” and said he was now in charge of the country.
He urged people to remain calm while insisting the police and army would ensure public order.
Martial law has been declared and Haiti’s borders and international airport are closed.
A friend of mine tells me “it’s been a long time since I’ve heard gunfire like this.” This is what Port-au-Prince sounded like a bit ago. Says gunfire is now “everywhere.”  #haiti  pic.twitter.com/Qfhnyg2i40
— Michael Deibert (@michaelcdeibert)  July 7, 2021 “The president was assassinated at his home by foreigners who spoke English and Spanish,” Mr Joseph said.
He said the attackers presented themselves as Drug and Enforcement Administration (DEA) Agents in video from the scene.
“I believe they are fake DEA agents,” he told reporters.
State Department spokesperson Ned Price said suggestions the attackers were DEA agents were “absolutely false”.
Mr Joseph described the attackers as a “highly trained and heavily armed group”.
Haitian first lady Martine Moise was injured in the attack and will be moved to a hospital in Miami for treatment.

Mr Moise had ruled Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, by decree, after legislative elections due in 2018 were delayed in the wake of disputes, including on when his own term ends.
In addition to the political crisis, kidnappings for ransom have surged in recent months, reflecting the growing influence of armed gangs in the Caribbean nation.
Haiti also faces chronic poverty and recurrent natural disasters.
The president faced steep opposition from swathes of the population that deemed his mandate illegitimate, and he churned through a series of seven prime ministers in four year.
Most recently, Joseph was supposed to be replaced this week after only three months in the post.
In addition to presidential, legislative and local elections, Haiti was due to have a constitutional referendum in September after it was twice postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
World reacts
US President Joe Biden called the assassination “very worrisome”.
“We need a lot more information but, it’s been very worrisome about the state of Haiti,” he told reporters.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said “we will be helpful in any way to the people of Haiti, to the government of Haiti.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was shocked at the “abhorrent” assassination.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was “shocked” by the assassination and warned it could further destabilise the Caribbean nation.
“This crime poses a risk of instability and a spiral of violence. The perpetrators of this assassination must be found and brought to justice,” Mr Borrell wrote on Twitter.
The Dominican Republic shuttered its border with Haiti after the assassination of the neighbouring country’s president.
The countries share a 380-kilometer border on the island of Hispaniola, and defence ministry spokesman Ceinett Sanchez told AFP its closure would be “immediate.”
Dominican President Luis Abinader condemned the killing, saying on Twitter the crime “undermines the democratic order in Haiti and the region.”
He offered condolences to the family of Moise and his wife Martine.
Local media said Abinader had summoned military leaders to analyse the situation on the island.
‘Multiple crises’
Mr Moise, a 53-year-old former entrepreneur who set up a string of businesses in the north of the country, where he hailed from, burst on to the political stage in 2017 with a message of rebuilding the impoverished nation.
He campaigned on populist pledges, as all candidates in Haiti do, but he kept up the rhetoric even after he was elected in February 2017.
The date of his election became the source of a political standoff. Mr Moise maintained that his term of office ran until February 7, 2022, but others claimed it ended on February 7, 2021.
The disagreement stems from the fact that Mr Moise was elected in a vote that was cancelled for fraud, and then re-elected a year later.
Without a parliament, the country fell further into crisis in 2020, and led to Mr Moise governing by decree, fuelling growing mistrust of him.
The constitution currently in force was written in 1987 after the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship and declares that “any popular consultation aimed at modifying the Constitution by referendum is formally prohibited.”
The United Nations Security Council, the United States and Europe had called for free and transparent legislative and presidential elections to be held by the end of this year.
The killing comes days after Mr Moise appointed Ariel Henry, a neurosurgeon who studied in France, as Haiti’s new prime minister.
Mr Henry, 71, has been part of Haiti’s coronavirus response and previously held posts in the government in 2015 and 2016 as interior minister then social affairs and labour minister.
Mr Henry is close to the opposition, but his appointment was not welcomed by the majority of opposition parties, who had continued to demand the president step down.

7,217425,SFGATE,2016-09-01,"“We are going to bring them to justice,” he said as the 17 suspects sat handcuffed on the floor during a press conference Thursday night.
Late Thursday, Colombia’s government said six of the suspects in Haiti, including two of those killed, were retired member of Colombia's army, though it didn’t release their identities.
The head of the Colombian national police, Gen. Jorge Luis Vargas Valencia, said President Iván Duque had instructed the high command of Colombia’s army and police to cooperate in the investigation.
“A team was formed with the best investigators ... they are going to send dates, flight times, financial information that is already being collected to be sent to Port-au-Prince,” Vargas said.
The oldest suspect is 55 and the youngest, Solages, is 35, according to a document shared by Mathias Pierre, Haiti’s minister of elections.
He would not provide additional details about Solages’ background, nor provide the name of the second Haitian American. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports that Haitian Americans were in custody but could not confirm or comment.
Solages described himself as a “certified diplomatic agent,” an advocate for children and budding politician on a website for a charity he established in 2019 in south Florida to assist residents.
On his bio page for the charity, Solages said he previously worked as a bodyguard at the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. The Canadian Embassy didn’t immediately comment; calls to the foundation and Solages’ associates at the charity either did not go through or weren't answered.
Witnesses said two suspects were discovered Thursday hiding in bushes in Port-au-Prince by a crowd, some of whom grabbed the men by their shirts and pants, pushing them and occasionally slapping them.
Police arrested the men, who were sweating heavily and wearing clothes that seemed to be smeared with mud, an Associated Press journalist said. Officers put them in the back of a pickup truck and drove away as the crowd ran after them to the nearby police station.
Once there, some in the crowd chanted: “They killed the president! Give them to us. We’re going to burn them!”
One man was overheard saying that it was unacceptable for foreigners to come to Haiti to kill the country’s leader, referring to reports from Haitian officials that the perpetrators spoke Spanish or English.
The crowd later set fire to several abandoned cars riddled with bullet holes that they believed belonged to the suspects, who were white men. The cars didn’t have license plates, and inside one of them was an empty box of bullets and some water.
At a news conference Thursday, Charles, the police chief, urged people to stay calm and let police do their work as he warned that authorities needed evidence they were destroying, including the burned cars.
Officials did not address a motive for the slaying, saying only that the attack, condemned by Haiti’s main opposition parties and the international community, was carried out by “a highly trained and heavily armed group.”
Not everyone was buying the government’s description of the attack. When Haitian journalist Robenson Geffrard, who writes for a local newspaper and has a radio show, tweeted a report on the police chief’s comments, he drew a flood of responses expressing skepticism. Many wondered how the sophisticated attackers described by police could penetrate Moïse’s home, security detail and panic room and then escape unharmed but were then caught without planning a successful getaway.
Meanwhile, a Haitian judge involved in the investigation said that Moïse was shot a dozen times and his office and bedroom were ransacked, according to the Haitian newspaper Le Nouvelliste. It quoted Judge Carl Henry Destin as saying investigators found 5.56 and 7.62 mm cartridges between the gatehouse and inside the house.
Moïse’s daughter, Jomarlie Jovenel, hid in her brother’s bedroom during the attack, he said, and a maid and another worker were tied up by the attackers.
Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph, who assumed leadership of Haiti with the backing of police and the military, asked people to reopen businesses and go back to work as he ordered the reopening of the international airport.
On Wednesday, Joseph decreed a two-week state of siege following Moïse’s killing, which stunned a nation grappling with some of the Western Hemisphere’s highest poverty, violence and political instability.
Inflation and gang violence have spiraled upward as food and fuel grew scarcer in a country where 60% of Haitians earn less than $2 a day. The increasingly dire situation comes as Haiti is still trying to recover from the devastating 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016 following a history of dictatorship and political upheaval.
“There is this void now, and they are scared about what will happen to their loved ones,” said Marlene Bastien, executive director of Family Action Network Movement, a group that helps people in Miami’s Little Haiti community.
She called on the Biden administration to take a much more active role in supporting attempts at national dialogue in Haiti with the aim of holding free, fair and credible elections.
Meanwhile, the Security Council met Thursday to talk about the situation in Haiti, and U.N. special envoy Helen La Lime, speaking to reporters at U.N. headquarters from Port-Au-Prince, said Haiti made a request for additional security assistance.
Haiti had grown increasingly unstable under Moïse, who had been ruling by decree for more than a year and faced violent protests as critics accused him of trying to amass more power while the opposition demanded he step down.
Moïse had faced large protests in recent months that turned violent as opposition leaders and their supporters rejected his plans to hold a constitutional referendum with proposals that would strengthen the presidency.
According to Haiti’s constitution, Moïse should be replaced by the president of Haiti’s Supreme Court, but the chief justice died in recent days from COVID-19, leaving open the question of who might rightfully succeed to the office.
Joseph, meanwhile, was supposed to be replaced by Ariel Henry, a neurosurgeon who had been named prime minister by Moïse a day before the assassination.
Henry told the AP that he is the prime minister, calling it an exceptional and confusing situation. “I am the prime minister in office,” he said.
On Thursday, public transportation and street vendors remained scarce, an unusual sight for the normally bustling streets of Port-au-Prince.
Marco Destin, 39, was walking to see his family since no buses, known as tap-taps, were available. He was carrying a loaf of bread for them because they had not left their house since the president’s killing out of fear for their lives.
“Every one at home is sleeping with one eye open and one eye closed,” he said. “If the head of state is not protected, I don’t have any protection whatsoever.”
Gunfire rang out intermittently across the city hours after the killing, a grim reminder of the growing power of gangs that displaced more than 14,700 people last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.
Robert Fatton, a Haitian politics expert at the University of Virginia, said gangs were a force to contend with and it isn’t certain Haiti’s security forces can enforce a state of siege.
“It’s a really explosive situation,” he said, adding that foreign intervention with a U.N.-type military presence is a possibility.
“Whether Claude Joseph manages to stay in power is a huge question. It will be very difficult to do so if he doesn’t create a government of national unity.”

8,217426,Voice of America,2016-09-01,"WASHINGTON / PORT-AU-PRINCE - Haitian police arrested “the presumed assassins” of Haiti President Jovenel Moise, a government official announced on social media late Wednesday.
""Alleged assassins of [Moise] intercepted by the National Police in Pelerin shortly before 6 p.m. tonight,"" Communications Secretary Frantz Exantus tweeted, according to media reports.
Exantus provided no other details, such as how many suspects had been arrested. He said additional details would be released soon.
A manhunt ensued after the shooting death of Moise at his private residence in a wealthy suburb of the capital, Port-au-Prince, before dawn on Wednesday
""Those killers are on the loose,"" Haitian Ambassador to the United States Bocchit Edmond said Wednesday during a briefing with reporters covering the State Department. ""We are calling for an international manhunt.""
Edmond said Haiti would request U.S. assistance and expertise. ""A stable Haiti is in the interest of the United States,"" he said.
Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic and its airports are closed, the ambassador said. Edmond said officials suspected the attackers were either still in Haiti or had escaped over the border. He ruled out the possibility of an escape via air, saying it would have been virtually impossible to evade the country's air surveillance system.
Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph declared a state of siege and said he was now in charge of the country.
Asked by VOA whether officials know the nationality of the gunmen, Edmond said he was unsure, but based on video footage obtained by the national police and deemed credible, the assassins, whom he described as ""mercenaries,"" posed as agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
""They are speaking Spanish and presented themselves as DEA agents. As we well know, this is not the way the DEA operates. I believe they are fake DEA agents. Experts who saw the video said those are professional killers,"" Edmond told reporters.
First lady Martine Moise, who was shot during the attack, was in stable but critical condition, the ambassador said. She has been transferred to a hospital in Miami, Florida, for treatment. One of the president's children who was at home during the attack has been taken to a secure location.
White House reaction
U.S. President Joe Biden condemned the assassination and expressed condolences in a statement issued by the White House.
""We condemn this heinous act, and I am sending my sincere wishes for First Lady Moïse's recovery. The United States offers condolences to the people of Haiti, and we stand ready to assist as we continue to work for a safe and secure Haiti.""
Biden called the attack ""worrisome."" ""We need a lot more information,"" he said in response to a reporter's question before boarding Marine One en route to Joint Base Andrews Wednesday morning.
World bodies react
In Washington, the permanent council of the Organization of American States held a virtual emergency meeting to discuss the Moise assassination Wednesday afternoon. Member states condemned the killing and expressed condolences and solidarity with the Haitian people.
U.S. Ambassador Brad Freden said that he was shocked by the news and that the United States was concerned about Haiti's security and political stability. He called on all political actors to set aside their differences and work for the common good of the Haitian people.
In New York, the United Nations Security Council president, French Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere, said the council was deeply shocked by the assassination.
The council will meet privately Thursday morning to discuss developments.
""This is a critical moment. I think we all knew it was sensitive and difficult on the ground in Haiti,"" Ireland's ambassador, Geraldine Byrne Nason, told reporters. She said the council would discuss how it could support the people of Haiti.
""I think this is a dark hour for them, and we certainly want to be sure we can express our support for the people of Haiti,"" she said.
The United Nations has about 1,200 staff in Haiti as part of its political mission there.
US lawmakers react
On Capitol Hill, the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, New York Democrat Gregory Meeks, extended condolences to the Moise family and the Haitian people. He also expressed his concerns about violence.
""The spiral of violence and political assassinations are a threat to democracy in Haiti. My thoughts go out to the Haitian people as we all hope for a return to peace and stability,"" Meeks said in a statement. ""I will do everything I can to support a thorough investigation to ensure that those involved are held accountable.""
The committee's top Republican, Michael McCaul of Texas, also released a statement condemning the killing and calling for a probe.
""I strongly condemn the assassination of Haitian president Jovenel Moïse and hope his wife who was injured in the attack recovers quickly. There must be a full investigation and appropriate accountability for his murder. My condolences to the Moïse family and people of Haiti.""
Recent uptick in violence
Haiti has been experiencing political instability and division, as well as a rise in gang violence.
Last week in Port-au-Prince, gang leader Jimmy Cherisier, who is known by the nickname Barbecue, took to the streets to protest Moise's government, calling on him to resign.
""Jovenel (Moise) must go!"" Cherisier told reporters during the protest. ""A new group of people needs to lead this country, and we must sit together around a table, have a national dialogue so we can redefine this country.""
Seeking to reassure the nation, the Prime Minister Joseph has appealed for tranquility.
""Stay calm. The nation is secure. Let's look for harmony,"" he said.
Ambassador Edmond reiterated that message during his briefing with reporters.
""Violence is not the answer. There is no future in that,"" he said.

""Jovenel Moise was not terribly popular, but he was the president. He cannot be killed as if he were just an ordinary citizen,"" said a 55-year-old man in Port-au-Prince, who gave his name only as Paul.
A 28-year-old woman named Julia said she was wary of police claims that foreign mercenaries killed the president.
""Where were the well-equipped police who watch over the president night and day? Why didn't they react?"" she asked.
Prosecutors have the same question.
""I have given (police) the power to interview all the security agents close to President Jovenel Moise,"" said Port-au-Prince government commissioner Bed-Ford Claude on Thursday.
""If you are responsible for the security of the president, where were you? What did you do to avoid this fate for the president?"" Claude said.
Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph has declared a national ""state of siege"" and said he was now in charge.
Joseph has only been in his post as prime minister for three months, and was due to step down within days after Moise named a replacement on Monday.
Joseph's replacement, Ariel Henry, said Joseph ""is no longer prime minister in my opinion.""
""Does a country have several prime ministers?"" asked Henry.
The unpopular Moise had ruled Haiti by decree after legislative elections due in 2018 were delayed.
As well as presidential, legislative and local elections, Haiti was due to hold a constitutional referendum in September.
Moise, a successful businessman, campaigned for power as a populist and was sworn in on February 2017.
The end date of his mandate became the source of a standoff, as Moise maintained that his term of office ran until February 7, 2022, but others said it ended on February 7, 2021.

FRANCE
French Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian condemned what he described as a ""cowardly assassination"".
""All light must be cast on this crime that took place in a deteriorating political and security climate. I call on all actors in Haitian political life for calm and restraint,"" Le Drian said in a statement.

12,217430,CBC,2016-09-01,"A squad of gunmen assassinated Haitian President Jovenel Moïse and wounded his wife in an overnight raid on their home Wednesday, with police killing four suspects and arresting two others hours later amid growing chaos in a country already enduring gang violence and protests of his increasingly authoritarian rule.
Three police officers held hostage by the suspected gunmen were freed late Wednesday, said Leon Charles, chief of Haiti's national police.
Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph said the police and military were in control of security in Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, where a history of dictatorship and political upheaval have long stymied the consolidation of democratic rule.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Joseph called for an international investigation into the assassination, said that elections scheduled for later this year should be held and pledged to work with Moïse's allies and opponents alike.
""We need every single one to move the country forward,"" Joseph said. He alluded to enemies of the president, describing him as ""a man of courage"" who had opposed ""some oligarchs in the country, and we believe those things are not without consequences.""

'STATE OF SIEGE'
Despite Joseph's assurances that order would prevail, there was confusion about who should take control and widespread anxiety among Haitians. Authorities declared a ""state of siege"" in the country and closed the international airport.
The normally bustling streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, were empty Wednesday. Sporadic gunshots were heard in the distance, public transportation was scarce and some people searched for businesses that were open for food and water.
Bocchit Edmond, the Haitian ambassador to the United States, said the attack on the 53-year-old Moïse ""was carried out by foreign mercenaries and professional killers — well-orchestrated,"" and that they were masquerading as agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The DEA has an office in the Haitian capital to assist the government in counternarcotics programs, according to the U.S. Embassy.
Joseph said the heavily armed gunmen spoke Spanish or English, but gave no further details.

SLAIN PRESIDENT'S WIFE IN CRITICAL CONDITION
Moïse's wife, Martine, was in stable but critical condition and was being moved to Miami for treatment, Edmond said.
Haiti has asked the U.S. government for assistance with the investigation, he said.
The Dominican Republic said it was closing the border and reinforcing security in the area, describing the frontier as ""completely calm.""
Haiti appeared to be heading for fresh volatility ahead of general elections later this year. Moïse had been ruling by decree for more than a year after failing to hold elections, and the opposition demanded he step down in recent months, saying he was leading it toward yet another grim period of authoritarianism.
It was a testament to Haiti's fragile political situation that Joseph, a protégé of Moïse who was only supposed to be prime minister temporarily, found himself in charge.
But Haiti appears to have few other options. The Supreme Court's chief justice, who might be expected to help provide stability in a crisis, died recently of COVID-19.
The main opposition parties said they were greatly dismayed about the killing.
""In this painful circumstance, the political forces of the opposition condemn with utmost rigour this heinous crime that is at odds with democratic principles,"" their statement said.
The parties added that they hope the Haitian National Police will take all necessary measures to protect lives and property, and they called on Haitians to be ""extremely vigilant.""

'NOTHING CAN BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED'
Joseph is likely to lead Haiti for now, though that could change in a nation where constitutional provisions have been erratically observed, said Alex Dupuy, a Haiti-born sociologist at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn.
The best scenario would be for the acting prime minister and opposition parties to come together and hold elections, Dupuy said.
""But, in Haiti, nothing can be taken for granted. It depends how the current balance of forces in Haiti plays out,"" he said, describing the situation as dangerous and volatile. Haiti's police force is already grappling with a recent spike in violence in Port-au-Prince that has displaced more than 14,700 people, he said.
Former Haitian president Michel Martelly, whom Moïse succeeded, called the assassination ""a hard blow for our country and for Haitian democracy, which is struggling to find its way.""
Prime Minister  Justin Trudeau expressed his condemnation  of the ""appalling assassination.""
U.S. President Joe Biden said he was ""shocked and saddened to hear of the horrific assassination,"" and condemned ""this heinous act.""
""The United States offers condolences to the people of Haiti, and we stand ready to assist as we continue to work for a safe and secure Haiti,"" Biden said in a statement.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also condemned the assassination and stressed that ""the perpetrators of this crime must be brought to justice,"" UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. The Security Council scheduled an emergency closed meeting on Haiti for Thursday.
Governments in Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe and elsewhere also expressed their concern at Haiti's plight."

15,217433,Chron,2016-09-01,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Two men believed to be Haitian Americans — one of them purportedly a former bodyguard at the Canadian Embassy in Port au Prince — have been arrested in connection with the assassination of Haiti’s president, Haitian officials said Thursday.
James Solages and Joseph Vincent were among 17 suspects detained in the brazen killing of President Jovenel Moïse by gunmen at his home in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday. Fifteen of them are from Colombia, according to Léon Charles, chief of Haiti's National Police. He added that three other suspects were killed by police and eight others are on the run. Charles had earlier said seven were killed.
“We are going to bring them to justice,” he said as the 17 suspects sat handcuffed on the floor during a press conference Thursday night.
Late Thursday, Colombia’s government said six of the suspects in Haiti, including two of those killed, were retired member of Colombia's army, though it didn’t release their identities.
The head of the Colombian national police, Gen. Jorge Luis Vargas Valencia, said President Iván Duque had instructed the high command of Colombia’s army and police to cooperate in the investigation.
“A team was formed with the best investigators ... they are going to send dates, flight times, financial information that is already being collected to be sent to Port-au-Prince,” Vargas said.
The oldest suspect is 55 and the youngest, Solages, is 35, according to a document shared by Mathias Pierre, Haiti’s minister of elections.
He would not provide additional details about Solages’ background, nor provide the name of the second Haitian American. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports that Haitian Americans were in custody but could not confirm or comment.
Solages described himself as a “certified diplomatic agent,” an advocate for children and budding politician on a website for a charity he established in 2019 in south Florida to assist residents.
On his bio page for the charity, Solages said he previously worked as a bodyguard at the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. The Canadian Embassy didn’t immediately comment; calls to the foundation and Solages’ associates at the charity either did not go through or weren't answered.
Witnesses said two suspects were discovered Thursday hiding in bushes in Port-au-Prince by a crowd, some of whom grabbed the men by their shirts and pants, pushing them and occasionally slapping them.
Police arrested the men, who were sweating heavily and wearing clothes that seemed to be smeared with mud, an Associated Press journalist said. Officers put them in the back of a pickup truck and drove away as the crowd ran after them to the nearby police station.
Once there, some in the crowd chanted: “They killed the president! Give them to us. We’re going to burn them!”
One man was overheard saying that it was unacceptable for foreigners to come to Haiti to kill the country’s leader, referring to reports from Haitian officials that the perpetrators spoke Spanish or English.
The crowd later set fire to several abandoned cars riddled with bullet holes that they believed belonged to the suspects, who were white men. The cars didn’t have license plates, and inside one of them was an empty box of bullets and some water.
At a news conference Thursday, Charles, the police chief, urged people to stay calm and let police do their work as he warned that authorities needed evidence they were destroying, including the burned cars.
Officials did not address a motive for the slaying, saying only that the attack, condemned by Haiti’s main opposition parties and the international community, was carried out by “a highly trained and heavily armed group.”
Not everyone was buying the government’s description of the attack. When Haitian journalist Robenson Geffrard, who writes for a local newspaper and has a radio show, tweeted a report on the police chief’s comments, he drew a flood of responses expressing skepticism. Many wondered how the sophisticated attackers described by police could penetrate Moïse’s home, security detail and panic room and then escape unharmed but were then caught without planning a successful getaway.
Meanwhile, a Haitian judge involved in the investigation said that Moïse was shot a dozen times and his office and bedroom were ransacked, according to the Haitian newspaper Le Nouvelliste. It quoted Judge Carl Henry Destin as saying investigators found 5.56 and 7.62 mm cartridges between the gatehouse and inside the house.
Moïse’s daughter, Jomarlie Jovenel, hid in her brother’s bedroom during the attack, he said, and a maid and another worker were tied up by the attackers.
Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph, who assumed leadership of Haiti with the backing of police and the military, asked people to reopen businesses and go back to work as he ordered the reopening of the international airport.
On Wednesday, Joseph decreed a two-week state of siege following Moïse’s killing, which stunned a nation grappling with some of the Western Hemisphere’s highest poverty, violence and political instability.
Inflation and gang violence have spiraled upward as food and fuel grew scarcer in a country where 60% of Haitians earn less than $2 a day. The increasingly dire situation comes as Haiti is still trying to recover from the devastating 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016 following a history of dictatorship and political upheaval.
“There is this void now, and they are scared about what will happen to their loved ones,” said Marlene Bastien, executive director of Family Action Network Movement, a group that helps people in Miami’s Little Haiti community.
She called on the Biden administration to take a much more active role in supporting attempts at national dialogue in Haiti with the aim of holding free, fair and credible elections.
Meanwhile, the Security Council met Thursday to talk about the situation in Haiti, and U.N. special envoy Helen La Lime, speaking to reporters at U.N. headquarters from Port-Au-Prince, said Haiti made a request for additional security assistance.
Haiti had grown increasingly unstable under Moïse, who had been ruling by decree for more than a year and faced violent protests as critics accused him of trying to amass more power while the opposition demanded he step down.
Moïse had faced large protests in recent months that turned violent as opposition leaders and their supporters rejected his plans to hold a constitutional referendum with proposals that would strengthen the presidency.
According to Haiti’s constitution, Moïse should be replaced by the president of Haiti’s Supreme Court, but the chief justice died in recent days from COVID-19, leaving open the question of who might rightfully succeed to the office.
Joseph, meanwhile, was supposed to be replaced by Ariel Henry, a neurosurgeon who had been named prime minister by Moïse a day before the assassination.
Henry told the AP that he is the prime minister, calling it an exceptional and confusing situation. “I am the prime minister in office,” he said.
On Thursday, public transportation and street vendors remained scarce, an unusual sight for the normally bustling streets of Port-au-Prince.
Marco Destin, 39, was walking to see his family since no buses, known as tap-taps, were available. He was carrying a loaf of bread for them because they had not left their house since the president’s killing out of fear for their lives.
“Every one at home is sleeping with one eye open and one eye closed,” he said. “If the head of state is not protected, I don’t have any protection whatsoever.”
Gunfire rang out intermittently across the city hours after the killing, a grim reminder of the growing power of gangs that displaced more than 14,700 people last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.
Robert Fatton, a Haitian politics expert at the University of Virginia, said gangs were a force to contend with and it isn’t certain Haiti’s security forces can enforce a state of siege.
“It’s a really explosive situation,” he said, adding that foreign intervention with a U.N.-type military presence is a possibility.
“Whether Claude Joseph manages to stay in power is a huge question. It will be very difficult to do so if he doesn’t create a government of national unity.”

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A squad of gunmen assassinated Haitian President Jovenel Moïse and wounded his wife in an overnight raid on their home Wednesday, with police killing four suspects and arresting two others hours later amid growing chaos in a country already enduring gang violence and protests of his increasingly authoritarian rule.

Joseph is likely to lead Haiti for now, though that could change in a nation where constitutional provisions have been erratically observed, said Alex Dupuy, a Haiti-born sociologist at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut.
The best scenario would be for the acting prime minister and opposition parties to come together and hold elections, Dupuy said.
“But, in Haiti, nothing can be taken for granted. It depends how the current balance of forces in Haiti plays out,” he said, describing the situation as dangerous and volatile. Haiti’s police force is already grappling with a recent spike in violence in Port-au-Prince that has displaced more than 14,700 people, he said.
Former President Michel Martelly, whom Moïse succeeded, called the assassination “a hard blow for our country and for Haitian democracy, which is struggling to find its way.”
U.S. President Joe Biden said he was “shocked and saddened to hear of the horrific assassination,” and condemned “this heinous act.”
“The United States offers condolences to the people of Haiti, and we stand ready to assist as we continue to work for a safe and secure Haiti,” Biden said in a statement.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned the assassination and stressed that “the perpetrators of this crime must be brought to justice,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. The Security Council scheduled an emergency closed meeting on Haiti for Thursday.
Governments in Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe and elsewhere also expressed their concern at Haiti’s plight.
A resident who lives near the president’s home said she heard the attack.
“I thought there was an earthquake, there was so much shooting,” said the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she fears for her life. “The president had problems with many people, but this is not how we expected him to die.”
The U.S. Embassy in Haiti said it was restricting U.S. staff to its compounds and closed the embassy Wednesday.
It’s too early to know exactly what will happen next, said Jonathan Katz, who previously covered Haiti for the AP and wrote a book about the country’s devastating earthquake.
“We don’t know who did this, what their end game is, what else they have planned,” he said, noting that Moïse had a long list of enemies. “There were a lot of people who wanted him gone. And there were a lot of people whom he wanted gone.”
“It seems to be a pretty well-financed operation,” he said, adding it could take days to piece together what happened. “That’s the question: Who’s behind it and what do they want?”
Moïse was killed a day after he nominated Ariel Henry, a neurosurgeon, as the new prime minister. Joseph took over the job of interim prime minister in April following the resignation of the previous premier, Joseph Jouthe — the latest in a revolving door of prime ministers.
In the AP interview, Joseph said he had spoken three times with Henry and that there was agreement he was in charge for now.
“He was actually designated but never took office,” Joseph said of Henry. “I was the one who was a prime minister, who was in office. This is what the law and the constitution says.”
However, in a separate AP interview, Henry appeared to contradict Joseph. “It’s an exceptional situation. There is a bit of confusion,” he said. “I am the prime minister in office.”
Haiti’s economic, political and social woes have deepened recently, with gang violence spiking in Port-au-Prince, inflation spiraling, and food and fuel becoming scarcer in a country where 60% of the population makes less than $2 a day. These troubles come as Haiti is still trying to recover from the devastating 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016.
Opposition leaders accused Moïse of seeking to increase his power, including by approving a decree that limited the powers of a court that audits government contracts and another that created an intelligence agency that answers only to the president.
He had faced large protests in recent months that turned violent as opposition leaders and their supporters rejected his plans to hold a constitutional referendum with proposals that would strengthen the presidency.
In recent months, opposition leaders demanded he step down, arguing that his term legally ended in February 2021. Moïse and supporters maintained that his term began when he took office in early 2017, following a chaotic election that forced the appointment of a provisional president to serve during a year-long gap.
In May, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced an 18-month extension of temporary legal status for Haitians living in the U.S., citing “serious security concerns (in Haiti), social unrest, an increase in human rights abuses, crippling poverty, and lack of basic resources, which are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The reprieve benefited an estimated 100,000 people who came after the devastating 2010 earthquake and are eligible for Temporary Protected Status, which gives haven to people fleeing countries struggling with civil strife or natural disasters.
This story has been updated to correct that Moïse ruled by decree for more than a year, not more than two years.

17,217435,HowStuffWorks,2016-09-01,""" ""  Members of the Haitian police stand guard outside of the presidential residence in Port-au-Prince, Haiti after Haitian President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated and his wife wounded early July 7, 2021 in an attack at their home.  VALERIE BAERISWYL/Getty Images Haitian President Jovenel Moïse was  assassinated in the early morning hours of July 7, 2021  , in a brazen attack on his private home outside Port-au-Prince, the capital. As reported by  The Washington Post  , a U.S. citizen of Haitian descent, James Solages, is among six people arrested in Moïse’s killing, according to Haiti’s minister of elections and inter-party relations, Mathias Pierre.
Moïse's wife was also shot in the assault that killed her husband and Haiti's prime minister reports he is running the country.
Moïse's assassination ended a four-and-a-half-year presidency that plunged the already troubled nation deeper into crisis.
Jovenel Moïse, 53, was born in 1968, meaning that he grew up under the Duvalier  dictatorship  in Haiti. Like most Haitians today, he lived through turbulent times — not only dictators but also  coups and widespread violence, including political assassinations  .
Moïse, a businessman turned president, made his way into politics using political connections that stemmed from the business world. Initially he invested in automobile-related businesses, primarily in the north of Haiti, where he was born. Eventually, he ultimately landed in the agricultural sector – a  big piece of the economy in Haiti, where many people farm  .
"" ""  Haitian President Jovenel Moïse (left) and Haitian First Lady Martine Moise (center) are seen at the National Palace in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, May 23, 2018. HECTOR RETAMAL /Getty Images In 2014, Moïse's agricultural finance company Agritrans  launched an organic banana plantation  , in part with state loans. Its creation  displaced hundreds of peasant farmers, who received minimal compensation  .
But the business brought Moïse prominence. It was as a famed banana exporter that Moïse met then-Haitian President Michel Martelly in 2014. Though he had no political experience, Moïse became  Martelly's hand-picked successor in Haiti's next election  .
Martelly was  deeply unpopular by the end of his term  , but party leaders assumed that Moïse would be more welcomed given his relatable background in farming.

A DIVISIVE AND UNSTABLE PRESIDENCY
Instead, Moïse barely eked out a  win in a Nov. 2016 election  that fewer than 12 percent of Haitians voted in. His meager electoral victory came after two years of delayed votes and  confirmed electoral fraud by Martelly's government  .
In 2017, Moïse's first year in office,  the Haitian Senate issued a report accusing him  of embezzling at least $700,000 of public money from an infrastructure development fund called PetroCaribe  to his banana business  .
Protesters flooded into the streets crying ""  Kot Kòb Petwo Karibe a  ?"" — ""where is the PetroCaribe money?""
"" ""  Demonstrators march in Port-au-Prince Feb. 14, 2021, in protest against the government of President Jovenel Moïse, saying the government was trying to establish a new dictatorship and denouncing international support for Moïse. VALERIE BAERISWYL/Getty Images Lacking the trust of the Haitian people, Moïse relied on hard power to remain in office.
He created a kind of police state in Haiti,  reviving the national army  two decades after it was disbanded and  creating a domestic intelligence agency  with surveillance powers.
Since early last year, Moïse had been ruling by decree. He effectively shuttered the Haitian legislature by refusing to  hold parliamentary elections scheduled for Jan. 2020  and summarily  dismissed all of the country's elected mayors in July 2020  , when their terms expired.
Sustained protests  — over gas shortages and blackouts, fiscal austerity that has caused  rapid inflation and deteriorating living conditions  , and  gang attacks that have killed several hundred  , among other issues — were a hallmark of Moïse's tenure.
Existing street protests exploded in early 2021 after Moïse refused to hold a presidential election and  step down when his four-year term ended in Feburary  . Instead, he claimed his term would end one year later, in Feb. 2022, because Haiti's 2016 election was postponed.
Before his death, Moïse planned to  change the Haitian Constitution  to strengthen the powers of the presidency and  prolong his administration  .

MEMORIES OF A DICTATORSHIP
For months before his assassination, Haitian protesters had been demanding Moïse's resignation.
For many Haitians, Moïse's undemocratic power grabs recall the 30-year, U.S.-backed dictatorships of François Duvalier, known as ""Papa Doc,"" and his son, Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier.
"" ""  François ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier posing for a portrait, Feb. 20, 1969 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Santi Visalli/Getty Images Both Papa Doc and Baby Doc relied on  murdering  and  brutalizing  Haitians to remain in power, with the unspoken approval of  Western political interests  in Haiti. Working with the Duvaliers, U.S. manufacturers in Haiti ensured that their investments were profitable by pushing for wages  to remain low and working conditions to remain poor  .
When mounting Haitian protests ended the regime in 1986, Baby Doc fled the country. The Duvaliers had enriched themselves, but Haiti was left in  economic collapse and social ruin  .
The 1987 Haitian Constitution that Moïse sought to change was written soon after to ensure that Haiti would never slide back into dictatorship.
Beyond Moïse's use of state violence to suppress opposition, anti-Moïse protesters before his killing pointed out another similarity with the Duvalier era: the United States' support.
In March, the U.S. State Department announced that it supported Moïse's  decision to remain in office until 2022  , to give the crisis-stricken country time to ""elect their leaders and restore Haiti's democratic institutions.""
That stance — which echoes that of Western-dominated international organizations that hold substantial sway in Haiti,  such as the Organization of American States  — sustained what was left of Moïse's legitimacy to remain president.

From its invasion and military occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934 to its support of the Duvalier regime, the U.S. has played a  major role in destabilizing Haiti  .
Ever since the devastating Haitian earthquake of 2010, international organizations like the United Nations and nonprofits like the American Red Cross have also had an  outsize presence in the country  .
Now, the unpopular president that foreign powers supported in hopes of achieving some measure of political stability in Haiti has been killed.

18,217436,SFGATE,2016-09-01,"Joseph said that he was dismayed by opponents who’ve tried to take advantage of Moïse’s murder to seize political power — an indirect reference to a group of lawmakers that have declared their loyalty and recognized Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti’s dismantled senate, as provisional president and Ariel Henry, whom Moïse designated as prime minister a day before he was killed, as prime minister.
""I’m not interested in a power struggle,” Joseph said in the brief phone interview, without mentioning Lambert by name. “There’s only one way people can become president in Haiti. And that’s through elections.”
Joseph spoke just hours after the head of Colombia's police said that the Colombians implicated in Moïse's assassination were recruited by four companies and traveled to the Caribbean nation in two groups via the Dominican Republic. Meanwhile, the U.S. said it would send senior FBI and Homeland Security officials to help in the investigation.
Haitian National Police Chief Léon Charles said 17 suspects have been detained in the brazen killing of Moïse that stunned a nation already reeling from poverty, widespread violence and political instability.
As the investigation moved forward, the killing took on the air of a complicated international conspiracy. Besides the Colombians, among those detained by police were two Haitian Americans, who have been described as translators for the attackers. Some of the suspects were seized in a raid on Taiwan’s Embassy where they are believed to have sought refuge.
At a news conference in Colombia’s capital of Bogota, Gen. Jorge Luis Vargas Valencia said four companies had been involved in the “recruitment, the gathering of these people” implicated in the assassination, although he did not identify the companies because their names were still being verified.
Two of the suspects traveled to Haiti via Panama and the Dominican Republic, Vargas said, while a second group of 11 arrived in Haiti on July 4 from the Dominican Republic.
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said senior FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials will be sent to Haiti “as soon as possible to assess the situation and how we may be able to assist.”
“The United States remains engaged and in close consultations with our Haitian and international partners to support the Haitian people in the aftermath of the assassination of the president,” Psaki said.
Following Haiti's request for U.S. troops, a senior administration official reiterated Psaki’s earlier comments that the administration is sending officials to assess how it can be most helpful, but added there are no plans to provide military assistance at this time.
The U.S. sent troops to Haiti following the last presidential assassination in the country, the murder of President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam in 1915 at the hands of an angry mob that had raided the French Embassy where he had sought refuge.
In Haiti, National Police Chief Léon Charles said another eight suspects were still at large and being sought for
Investigative Judge Clément Noël told the French-language newspaper Le Nouvelliste that the Haitian Americans arrested, James Solages and Joseph Vincent, said the attackers originally planned only to arrest Moïse, not kill him. Noël said Solages and Vincent were acting as translators for the attackers.
The same newspaper quoted Port-au-Prince prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude as saying he ordered an investigative unit of the National Police Force to interrogate all the security agents close to Moïse. These include Moise’s security coordinator Jean Laguel Civil and Dimitri Hérard, head of the General Security Unit of the National Palace.
“If you are responsible for the president’s security, where have you been? What did you do to avoid this fate for the president?” Claude said.
The attack, which took place at Moïse’s home before dawn Wednesday, also seriously wounded his wife, who was flown to Miami for treatment.
Joseph assumed leadership with the backing of police and the military and declared a two-week “state of siege.” Port-au-Prince already has been on edge amid the growing power of gangs that displaced more than 14,700 people last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.
The killing brought the usually bustling capital to a standstill, but Joseph urged the public to return to work.
Vargas has pledged Colombia’s full cooperation, and authorities there identified 13 of the 15 Colombians implicated in the attack as retired members of the military, 11 captured and two killed. They range in rank from lieutenant colonel to soldier.
The commander of Colombia’s Armed Forces, Gen. Luis Fernando Navarro, said they had left the institution between 2018 and 2020.
“In the criminal world, there is the concept of murder for hire and this is what happened: they hired some members of the (army) reserve for this purpose and they have to respond criminally for the acts they committed,” said retired Colombian army general Jaime Ruiz Barrera.
Senior officials from Colombia’s security forces will travel to Haiti to help with the investigation.
U.S.-trained Colombian soldiers are heavily recruited by private security firms in global conflict zones because of their experience in a decades-long war against leftist rebels and powerful drug cartels.
The wife of one former Colombian soldier in custody said he was recruited by a security firm to travel to the Dominican Republic last month.
The woman, who identified herself only as “Yuli,” told Colombia’s W Radio that her husband, Francisco Uribe, was hired for $2,700 a month by a company named CTU to travel to the Dominican Republic, where he was told he would provide protection to some powerful families. She says she last spoke to him at 10 p.m. Wednesday — almost a day after Moïse’s killing— and said he was on guard duty at a house where he and others were staying.
“The next day he wrote me a message that sounded like a farewell,” the woman said. “They were running, they had been attacked. ... That was the last contact I had.”
The woman said she knew little about her husband’s activities and was unaware he had even traveled to Haiti.
Uribe is under investigation for his alleged role in extrajudicial killings by Colombia’s U.S.-trained army more than a decade ago. Colombian court records show he and another soldier were accused of killing a civilian in 2008 who they later tried to present as a criminal killed in combat.
The CTU in question may be CTU Security in Miami-Dade. The business has two listed addresses on its website. One was a shuttered warehouse with no sign indicating who it belonged to. The other is a simple office under a different company’s name where the receptionist says the CTU owner comes once a week to collect meal and hold the occasional meeting.
Solages, 35, described himself as a “certified diplomatic agent,” an advocate for children and budding politician on a now-removed website for a charity he started in 2019 in south Florida to assist resident of his home town of Jacmel, on Haiti’s southern coast.
Solages also said he had worked as a bodyguard at the Canadian Embassy in Haiti, and on his Facebook page, which was also taken down after news of his arrest, he showcased photos of armored military vehicles and a shot of himself standing in front of an American flag.
Canada’s foreign relation department released a statement that did not refer to Solages by name but said one of the men detained for his alleged role in the killing had been “briefly employed as a reserve bodyguard” at its embassy by a private contractor.
Calls to the charity and Solages’ associates went unanswered. However, a relative in south Florida said Solages doesn’t have any military training and doesn’t believe he was involved in the killing.
“I feel like my son killed my brother because I love my president and I love James Solages,” Schubert Dorisme, whose wife is Solages’ aunt, told WPLG in Miami.
Taiwan’s Embassy in Port-au-Prince said police had arrested 11 individuals who tried to break into the compound early Thursday. It gave no details of their identities or a reason for the break-in but in a statement referred to the men as “mercenaries” and strongly condemned the “cruel and barbaric assassination” of Moïse.
“As for whether the suspects were involved in the assassination of the president of Haiti, that will need to be investigated by the Haitian police,” Foreign Affairs spokesperson Joanne Ou told The Associated Press in Taipei.
Police were alerted by embassy security while Taiwanese diplomats were working from home. Haiti is one of a handful of countries with diplomatic relations with Taiwan.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A squad of gunmen assassinated Haitian President Jovenel Moïse and wounded his wife in an overnight raid on their home Wednesday, with police killing four suspects and arresting two others hours later amid growing chaos in a country already enduring gang violence and protests of his increasingly authoritarian rule.
Three police officers held hostage by the suspected gunmen were freed late Wednesday after police surrounded a house where some of the suspects were hiding, said Léon Charles, chief of Haiti’s National Police.
Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph said the police and military were in control of security in Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas where a history of dictatorship and political upheaval have long stymied the consolidation of democratic rule.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Joseph called for an international investigation into the assassination, said that elections scheduled for later this year should be held and pledged to work with Moïse’s allies and opponents alike.
“We need every single one to move the country forward,” Joseph said. He alluded to enemies of the president, describing him as ’’a man of courage″ who had opposed ’’some oligarchs in the country, and we believe those things are not without consequences.″
Despite Joseph’s assurances that order would prevail, there was confusion about who should take control and widespread anxiety among Haitians. Authorities declared a “state of siege” in the country and closed the international airport.
The normally bustling streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, were empty Wednesday. Sporadic gunshots were heard in the distance, public transportation was scarce, and some people searched for businesses that were open for food and water.
Bocchit Edmond, the Haitian ambassador to the United States, said the attack on the 53-year-old Moïse “was carried out by foreign mercenaries and professional killers — well-orchestrated,” and that they were masquerading as agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The DEA has an office in the Haitian capital to assist the government in counternarcotics programs, according to the U.S. Embassy.
Joseph said the heavily armed gunmen spoke Spanish or English, but gave no further details.
Moïse’s wife, Martine, was in stable but critical condition and was being moved to Miami for treatment, Edmond said in Washington.
Haiti has asked the U.S. government for assistance with the investigation, he said, adding that the assassins could have escaped over the land border to the Dominican Republic or by sea.
The Dominican Republic said it was closing the border and reinforcing security in the area, describing the frontier as ″completely calm.″
Haiti appeared to be heading for fresh volatility ahead of general elections later this year. Moïse had been ruling by decree for more than a year after failing to hold elections, and the opposition demanded he step down in recent months, saying he was leading it toward yet another grim period of authoritarianism.
It was a testament to Haiti’s fragile political situation that Joseph, a protege of Moïse who was only supposed to be prime minster temporarily, found himself in charge.
But Haiti appears to have few other options. The Supreme Court’s chief justice, who might be expected to help provide stability in a crisis, died recently of COVID-19.
The main opposition parties said they were greatly dismayed about the killing.
“In this painful circumstance, the political forces of the opposition condemn with utmost rigor this heinous crime that is at odds with democratic principles,” their statement said.
The parties added that they hope the National Police will take all necessary measures to protect lives and property, and they called on Haitians to be “extremely vigilant.”
Joseph is likely to lead Haiti for now, though that could change in a nation where constitutional provisions have been erratically observed, said Alex Dupuy, a Haiti-born sociologist at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut.
The best scenario would be for the acting prime minister and opposition parties to come together and hold elections, Dupuy said.
“But, in Haiti, nothing can be taken for granted. It depends how the current balance of forces in Haiti plays out,” he said, describing the situation as dangerous and volatile. Haiti’s police force is already grappling with a recent spike in violence in Port-au-Prince that has displaced more than 14,700 people, he said.
Former President Michel Martelly, whom Moïse succeeded, called the assassination “a hard blow for our country and for Haitian democracy, which is struggling to find its way.”
U.S. President Joe Biden said he was “shocked and saddened to hear of the horrific assassination,” and condemned “this heinous act.”
“The United States offers condolences to the people of Haiti, and we stand ready to assist as we continue to work for a safe and secure Haiti,” Biden said in a statement.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned the assassination and stressed that “the perpetrators of this crime must be brought to justice,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. The Security Council scheduled an emergency closed meeting on Haiti for Thursday.
Governments in Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe and elsewhere also expressed their concern at Haiti’s plight.
A resident who lives near the president’s home said she heard the attack.
“I thought there was an earthquake, there was so much shooting,” said the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she fears for her life. “The president had problems with many people, but this is not how we expected him to die.”
The U.S. Embassy in Haiti said it was restricting U.S. staff to its compounds and closed the embassy Wednesday.
It’s too early to know exactly what will happen next, said Jonathan Katz, who previously covered Haiti for the AP and wrote a book about the country’s devastating earthquake.
“We don’t know who did this, what their end game is, what else they have planned,” he said, noting that Moïse had a long list of enemies. “There were a lot of people who wanted him gone. And there were a lot of people whom he wanted gone.”
“It seems to be a pretty well-financed operation,” he said, adding it could take days to piece together what happened. “That’s the question: Who’s behind it and what do they want?”
Moïse was killed a day after he nominated Ariel Henry, a neurosurgeon, as the new prime minister. Joseph took over the job of interim prime minister in April following the resignation of the previous premier, Joseph Jouthe — the latest in a revolving door of prime ministers.
In the AP interview, Joseph said he had spoken three times with Henry and that there was agreement he was in charge for now.
“He was actually designated but never took office,” Joseph said of Henry. “I was the one who was a prime minister, who was in office. This is what the law and the constitution says.”
However, in a separate AP interview, Henry appeared to contradict Joseph. “It’s an exceptional situation. There is a bit of confusion,” he said. “I am the prime minister in office.”
Haiti’s economic, political and social woes have deepened recently, with gang violence spiking in Port-au-Prince, inflation spiraling, and food and fuel becoming scarcer in a country where 60% of the population makes less than $2 a day. These troubles come as Haiti is still trying to recover from the devastating 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016.
Opposition leaders accused Moïse of seeking to increase his power, including by approving a decree that limited the powers of a court that audits government contracts and another that created an intelligence agency that answers only to the president.
He had faced large protests in recent months that turned violent as opposition leaders and their supporters rejected his plans to hold a constitutional referendum with proposals that would strengthen the presidency.
In recent months, opposition leaders demanded he step down, arguing that his term legally ended in February 2021. Moïse and supporters maintained that his term began when he took office in early 2017, following a chaotic election that forced the appointment of a provisional president to serve during a year-long gap.
In May, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced an 18-month extension of temporary legal status for Haitians living in the U.S., citing “serious security concerns (in Haiti), social unrest, an increase in human rights abuses, crippling poverty, and lack of basic resources, which are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The reprieve benefited an estimated 100,000 people who came after the devastating 2010 earthquake and are eligible for Temporary Protected Status, which gives haven to people fleeing countries struggling with civil strife or natural disasters.

21,217439,Mail Online,2016-09-01,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Two men believed to be Haitian Americans - one of them purportedly a former bodyguard at the Canadian Embassy in Port au Prince - have been arrested in connection with the assassination of Haiti´s president, Haitian officials said Thursday.
James Solages and Joseph Vincent were among 17 suspects detained in the brazen killing of President Jovenel Moïse by gunmen at his home in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday. Fifteen of them are from Colombia, according to Léon Charles, chief of Haiti's National Police. He added that three other suspects were killed by police and eight others are on the run. Charles had earlier said seven were killed.
""We are going to bring them to justice,"" he said as the 17 suspects sat handcuffed on the floor during a press conference Thursday night.
Late Thursday, Colombia´s government said six of the suspects in Haiti, including two of those killed, were retired member of Colombia's army, though it didn´t release their identities.
The head of the Colombian national police, Gen. Jorge Luis Vargas Valencia, said President Iván Duque had instructed the high command of Colombia´s army and police to cooperate in the investigation.
""A team was formed with the best investigators ... they are going to send dates, flight times, financial information that is already being collected to be sent to Port-au-Prince,"" Vargas said.

Moise was assassinated in an attack on his private residence early Wednesday. (AP Photo/Joseph Odelyn)

The oldest suspect is 55 and the youngest, Solages, is 35, according to a document shared by Mathias Pierre, Haiti´s minister of elections.
He would not provide additional details about Solages´ background, nor provide the name of the second Haitian American. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports that Haitian Americans were in custody but could not confirm or comment.
Solages described himself as a ""certified diplomatic agent,"" an advocate for children and budding politician on a website for a charity he established in 2019 in south Florida to assist residents.
On his bio page for the charity, Solages said he previously worked as a bodyguard at the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. The Canadian Embassy didn´t immediately comment; calls to the foundation and Solages´ associates at the charity either did not go through or weren't answered.
Witnesses said two suspects were discovered Thursday hiding in bushes in Port-au-Prince by a crowd, some of whom grabbed the men by their shirts and pants, pushing them and occasionally slapping them.
Police arrested the men, who were sweating heavily and wearing clothes that seemed to be smeared with mud, an Associated Press journalist said. Officers put them in the back of a pickup truck and drove away as the crowd ran after them to the nearby police station.
Once there, some in the crowd chanted: ""They killed the president! Give them to us. We´re going to burn them!""
One man was overheard saying that it was unacceptable for foreigners to come to Haiti to kill the country´s leader, referring to reports from Haitian officials that the perpetrators spoke Spanish or English.
The crowd later set fire to several abandoned cars riddled with bullet holes that they believed belonged to the suspects, who were white men. The cars didn´t have license plates, and inside one of them was an empty box of bullets and some water.
At a news conference Thursday, Charles, the police chief, urged people to stay calm and let police do their work as he warned that authorities needed evidence they were destroying, including the burned cars.
Officials did not address a motive for the slaying, saying only that the attack, condemned by Haiti´s main opposition parties and the international community, was carried out by ""a highly trained and heavily armed group.""
Not everyone was buying the government´s description of the attack. When Haitian journalist Robenson Geffrard, who writes for a local newspaper and has a radio show, tweeted a report on the police chief´s comments, he drew a flood of responses expressing skepticism. Many wondered how the sophisticated attackers described by police could penetrate Moïse´s home, security detail and panic room and then escape unharmed but were then caught without planning a successful getaway.
Meanwhile, a Haitian judge involved in the investigation said that Moïse was shot a dozen times and his office and bedroom were ransacked, according to the Haitian newspaper Le Nouvelliste. It quoted Judge Carl Henry Destin as saying investigators found 5.56 and 7.62 mm cartridges between the gatehouse and inside the house.
Moïse´s daughter, Jomarlie Jovenel, hid in her brother´s bedroom during the attack, he said, and a maid and another worker were tied up by the attackers.
Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph, who assumed leadership of Haiti with the backing of police and the military, asked people to reopen businesses and go back to work as he ordered the reopening of the international airport.
On Wednesday, Joseph decreed a two-week state of siege following Moïse´s killing, which stunned a nation grappling with some of the Western Hemisphere´s highest poverty, violence and political instability.
Inflation and gang violence have spiraled upward as food and fuel grew scarcer in a country where 60% of Haitians earn less than $2 a day. The increasingly dire situation comes as Haiti is still trying to recover from the devastating 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016 following a history of dictatorship and political upheaval.
""There is this void now, and they are scared about what will happen to their loved ones,"" said Marlene Bastien, executive director of Family Action Network Movement, a group that helps people in Miami´s Little Haiti community.
She called on the Biden administration to take a much more active role in supporting attempts at national dialogue in Haiti with the aim of holding free, fair and credible elections.
Meanwhile, the Security Council met Thursday to talk about the situation in Haiti, and U.N. special envoy Helen La Lime, speaking to reporters at U.N. headquarters from Port-Au-Prince, said Haiti made a request for additional security assistance.
Haiti had grown increasingly unstable under Moïse, who had been ruling by decree for more than a year and faced violent protests as critics accused him of trying to amass more power while the opposition demanded he step down.
Moïse had faced large protests in recent months that turned violent as opposition leaders and their supporters rejected his plans to hold a constitutional referendum with proposals that would strengthen the presidency.
According to Haiti´s constitution, Moïse should be replaced by the president of Haiti´s Supreme Court, but the chief justice died in recent days from COVID-19, leaving open the question of who might rightfully succeed to the office.
Joseph, meanwhile, was supposed to be replaced by Ariel Henry, a neurosurgeon who had been named prime minister by Moïse a day before the assassination.
Henry told the AP that he is the prime minister, calling it an exceptional and confusing situation. ""I am the prime minister in office,"" he said.
On Thursday, public transportation and street vendors remained scarce, an unusual sight for the normally bustling streets of Port-au-Prince.
Marco Destin, 39, was walking to see his family since no buses, known as tap-taps, were available. He was carrying a loaf of bread for them because they had not left their house since the president´s killing out of fear for their lives.
""Every one at home is sleeping with one eye open and one eye closed,"" he said. ""If the head of state is not protected, I don´t have any protection whatsoever.""
Gunfire rang out intermittently across the city hours after the killing, a grim reminder of the growing power of gangs that displaced more than 14,700 people last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.
Robert Fatton, a Haitian politics expert at the University of Virginia, said gangs were a force to contend with and it isn´t certain Haiti´s security forces can enforce a state of siege.
""It´s a really explosive situation,"" he said, adding that foreign intervention with a U.N.-type military presence is a possibility.
""Whether Claude Joseph manages to stay in power is a huge question. It will be very difficult to do so if he doesn´t create a government of national unity.""

22,217440,@AOL,2016-09-01,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A squad of gunmen assassinated Haitian President Jovenel Moïse and wounded his wife in an overnight raid on their home Wednesday, with police killing four suspects and arresting two others hours later amid growing chaos in a country already enduring gang violence and protests of his increasingly authoritarian rule.
Three police officers held hostage by the suspected gunmen were freed late Wednesday, said Léon Charles, chief of Haiti’s National Police.
Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph said the police and military were in control of security in Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas where a history of dictatorship and political upheaval have long stymied the consolidation of democratic rule.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Joseph called for an international investigation into the assassination, said that elections scheduled for later this year should be held and pledged to work with Moïse's allies and opponents alike.
“We need every single one to move the country forward,” Joseph said. He alluded to enemies of the president, describing him as ‘’a man of courage'' who had opposed ‘’some oligarchs in the country, and we believe those things are not without consequences.''
Despite Joseph’s assurances that order would prevail, there was confusion about who should take control and widespread anxiety among Haitians. Authorities declared a “state of siege” in the country and closed the international airport.
The normally bustling streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, were empty Wednesday. Sporadic gunshots were heard in the distance, public transportation was scarce, and some people searched for businesses that were open for food and water.
Bocchit Edmond, the Haitian ambassador to the United States, said the attack on the 53-year-old Moïse ""was carried out by foreign mercenaries and professional killers — well-orchestrated,” and that they were masquerading as agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The DEA has an office in the Haitian capital to assist the government in counternarcotics programs, according to the U.S. Embassy.
Joseph said the heavily armed gunmen spoke Spanish or English, but gave no further details.
Moïse's wife, Martine, was in stable but critical condition and was being moved to Miami for treatment, Edmond said in Washington.
Haiti has asked the U.S. government for assistance with the investigation, he said, adding that the assassins could have escaped over the land border to the Dominican Republic or by sea.
The Dominican Republic said it was closing the border and reinforcing security in the area, describing the frontier as ″completely calm.″
Haiti appeared to be heading for fresh volatility ahead of general elections later this year. Moïse had been ruling by decree for more than a year after failing to hold elections, and the opposition demanded he step down in recent months, saying he was leading it toward yet another grim period of authoritarianism.
It was a testament to Haiti’s fragile political situation that Joseph, a protege of Moïse who was only supposed to be prime minster temporarily, found himself in charge.
But Haiti appears to have few other options. The Supreme Court’s chief justice, who might be expected to help provide stability in a crisis, died recently of COVID-19.
The main opposition parties said they were greatly dismayed about the killing.
“In this painful circumstance, the political forces of the opposition condemn with utmost rigor this heinous crime that is at odds with democratic principles,” their statement said.
The parties added that they hope the National Police will take all necessary measures to protect lives and property, and they called on Haitians to be “extremely vigilant.”
Joseph is likely to lead Haiti for now, though that could change in a nation where constitutional provisions have been erratically observed, said Alex Dupuy, a Haiti-born sociologist at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut.
The best scenario would be for the acting prime minister and opposition parties to come together and hold elections, Dupuy said.

23,217441,Global News,2016-09-01,"Haiti President Jovenel Moïse assassinated at home, official says  Story continues below advertisement Kevin Edmonds, an assistant professor of Caribbean Studies at the University of Toronto, said Canada and the United States have been involved in cultivating over the long term the current political situation in which the assassination took place.
In February 2004, a military coup overthrew a democratically elected government led by president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. He accused the United States, France and Canada of orchestrating his ousting.
About 500 Canadian troops went to the Caribbean country after the coup “to restore order until a new UN stabilization mission could be well established,” according to Veterans Affairs Canada website. It says UN peacekeeping missions in Haiti reached about 7,500 military members and civilian police, from dozens of countries. It also says that at times, over 750 members of the Canadian Armed Forces and 100 civilian police officers have served there.
Since 2004, Edmonds said, a series of fraudulent elections have brought deeply unpopular presidents to power while a UN mission supported them.
Haiti is the largest recipient of development assistance from Canada in the Americas.
-
-

Since the January 2010 earthquake, Ottawa has provided $1.5 billion to Haiti, including $345 million in humanitarian assistance and $1.15 billion in development assistance.
Edmonds said Canada played a role in pushing for a national election to be held in 2010, when many Haitian parliamentarians and politicians had lost their lives in the natural disaster. The general election originally scheduled to take in February was put off until November that year and the presidential election was held the following spring.
Story continues below advertisement “Canada and the United States were very insistent that elections happen right away, and a lot of voices within in Haiti, civil society, politicians, the citizens were saying ‘let’s wait a bit,'” Edmonds said, adding there were concerns about electoral fraud and parties banned from running.
In a 2019 report, Human Rights Watch said the Moise government’s elimination of subsidies led to widespread protests that had escalated since July 2018, with opposition groups demanding Moise’s resignation amid allegations that he had mismanaged government funds designated for social programs.
Edmonds said Moise was “very repressive,” but that he was also friendly to foreign investment as he was getting rid of regulations for mining, oil and gas companies and repressing labour unions.
“Having a weak but accommodating centre-right government in Haiti is good for Canadian interests U.S. interests,” Edmonds argued.
“I would have thought that Moise would have been tipped off that something’s gonna happen but this (assassination) is kind of unprecedented.”

“The [American] public has not really cared about this war that much for a long time,” Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow and director of research in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, told VOA. “Ever since roughly the overthrow of the Taliban in late 2001, this war just hasn't mattered to that many people that much of the time. And the only time that was talked about very much in presidential politics was probably the 2008 presidential election. But it was not even a point of disagreement.”
Success seemed possible
On October 8, it will be a full 20 years since Americans across the country awoke to newspaper headlines announcing, “U.S. Strikes Back,” and coverage of a massive overnight air assault on targets in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. It had been less than a month since teams of al-Qaida terrorists hijacked four American jetliners on 9/11, crashing two into the World Trade Center in Manhattan, one into the Pentagon and one into a Pennsylvania field, killing 2,996 people in total.
Over the following weeks, Americans watched as the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which had provided a safe haven for al-Qaida and its leader, Osama bin Laden, was routed by a combination of U.S. air power and an alliance of Afghan tribal militias.
By November, the Taliban had been driven from the country’s major cities: Mazar-e-Sharif, Herat, Kabul, Jalalabad. On December 5, with U.S. support, an interim government of Afghanistan was formed, led by Hamid Karzai. Days later, the Taliban’s last major stronghold in the southern city of Kandahar surrendered, and Mullah Omar, the group’s founder and leader, fled into hiding.
Americans were treated to romantic stories of bushy-bearded U.S. special forces operators who called in airstrikes while on horseback on the arid plains of northern Afghanistan.
At the time, it still seemed possible to imagine that the United States’ venture into Afghanistan would end with the brutally oppressive Taliban regime replaced with a Western-friendly democratic state that would serve as an example to people around the world as an alternative to extremism.
Dark chapter in US history
The two decades that followed the initial invasion of Afghanistan reflected a different reality.
Since U.S. boots first hit the ground, troop levels in the country have risen, dropped and risen again as efforts to install a durable, democratically elected government butted up against continuing suicide attacks and armed resistance by the Taliban and internecine squabbling among the United States’ nominal allies in the country. Over time, the Taliban regrouped and U.S. strategy evolved into a long-term counterinsurgency effort.
At the same time, the U.S. was forced to confront disturbing realities about its own policies.
Early in the war, the U.S. created a prison camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where U.S. troops held “enemy combatants” captured in Afghanistan, affording them neither due process rights nor the protections of the Geneva Conventions.
Rendition and torture
Over the next few years, the American public got the first hints of the extent to which the U.S. was using extralegal methods to capture and interrogate prisoners both in Afghanistan and elsewhere. They learned of the “extraordinary rendition” of suspects to “black sites” in countries where torture was commonplace and, in some cases, to places under U.S. control, like Bagram Airfield, outside Kabul.
Then came secret memos from the Department of Justice that purportedly cleared American officials themselves to use techniques such as waterboarding, commonly understood to be torture, to extract information from prisoners.
Even as it fought to defend itself against accusations that it had betrayed its own ideals, the U.S. launched another war, gathering allies to invade Iraq and destroy the weapons of mass destruction that the administration of President George W. Bush incorrectly insisted Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein was hiding.
Afghanistan as afterthought
As the Iraq war raged, the focus of the U.S. public on Afghanistan faded. In part, said O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution, that is an ironic artifact of the war’s initial popularity.
“There was overwhelming support in the fall of 2001 to punish the Taliban severely, even if we didn't quite know what that meant,” he said.
As a result, there was relatively little initial argument about whether the U.S. ought to be in Afghanistan in the first place, and therefore a more widespread acceptance of the idea that the U.S. had a responsibility to maintain stability there.
Inside the U.S., meanwhile, the reckoning over Guantanamo Bay and the U.S. torture program — eventually recognized as such by the Obama administration — would drag on for years. To this day, Gitmo holds 40 prisoners.
A multi-administration struggle
Four different U.S. presidents — Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and now Joe Biden — attempted to give a democratically elected Afghan government the tools it needed to keep an on-again, off-again insurgency at bay.
After Republican Bush left office in 2009, Obama, a Democrat, surged troops and contractors into the country in his first term, pushing the U.S. presence to more than 100,000 before announcing a drawdown years later that left a force about one-tenth of that size in the country.
Trump, a Republican, had campaigned on extracting the U.S. from its “forever wars” and initially said that he would be bringing all U.S. forces home. However, not long into his presidency, he reversed those plans out of fear that the country would become a “vacuum” that would attract terror groups.
Coming home
In April of this year, Democrat Biden announced that virtually all the remaining U.S. troops in the country would be brought home before September 11, 2021, the 20th anniversary of the attacks that triggered the war.
The tone of Biden’s comments when he announced the troop withdrawal was far from triumphalist.
“We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan, hoping to create ideal conditions for the withdrawal, and expecting a different result,"" he said. ""I’m now the fourth United States president to preside over American troop presence in Afghanistan: two Republicans, two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility on to a fifth.”"

True, al-Qaeda, which sparked the war by planning the 9/11 attacks from Afghanistan, is no longer much of a force in the country, although it has not been eliminated entirely. But that is about as far as it goes. Other anti-American terror groups, including a branch of Islamic State, continue to operate in Afghanistan. The zealots of the Taliban, who harboured Osama bin Laden and were overthrown by American-backed forces after 9/11, have made a  horrifying comeback  . They are in complete control of about half the country and threaten to conquer the rest. The democratic, pro-Western government fostered by so much American blood and money is corrupt, widely reviled and in steady retreat.
In theory, the Taliban and the American-backed government are negotiating a peace accord, whereby the insurgents lay down their arms and participate instead in a redesigned political system. In the best-case scenario, strong American support for the government, both financial and military (in the form of continuing air strikes on the Taliban), coupled with immense pressure on the insurgents’ friends, such as Pakistan, might succeed in producing some form of power-sharing agreement. But even if that were to happen—and the chances are low—it would be a depressing spectacle. The Taliban would insist on moving backwards in the direction of the brutal theocracy they imposed during their previous stint in power, when they confined women to their homes, stopped girls from going to school and meted out harsh punishments for sins such as wearing the wrong clothes or listening to the wrong music.
More likely than any deal, however, is that the Taliban try to use their victories on the battlefield to topple the government by force. They have already overrun much of the countryside, with government units mostly restricted to cities and towns. Demoralised government troops are abandoning their posts. This week over 1,000 of them fled from the north-eastern province of Badakhshan to neighbouring Tajikistan. The Taliban have not yet managed to capture and hold any cities, and may lack the manpower to do so in lots of places at once. They may prefer to throttle the government slowly rather than attack it head on. But the momentum is clearly on their side.

*This film was first published in July 2020*
At the very least, the civil war is likely to intensify, as the Taliban press their advantage and the government fights for its life. Other countries—China, India, Iran, Russia and Pakistan—will seek to fill the vacuum left by America. Some will funnel money and weapons to friendly warlords. The result will be yet more bloodshed and destruction, in a country that has suffered constant warfare for more than 40 years. Those who worry about possible reprisals against the locals who worked as translators for the Americans are missing the big picture: America is abandoning an entire country of almost 40m people to a grisly fate.
It did not have to be this way. For the past six years fewer than 10,000 American troops, plus a similar number from other  NATO  countries, have propped up the Afghan army enough to maintain the status quo. American casualties had dropped to almost nothing. The war, which used to rile voters, had become a political irrelevance in America. Since becoming president, Mr Biden has focused, rightly, on the threats posed by China and Russia. But the American deployment in Afghanistan had grown so small that it did not really interfere with that. The new American administration views the long stalemate as proof that there is no point remaining in Afghanistan. But for the Afghans whom it protected from the Taliban, the stalemate was precious.
There will be a long debate about how much the withdrawal saps America’s credibility and prestige. For all its wealth and military might, America failed not only to create a strong, self-sufficient Afghan state, but also to defeat a determined insurgency. What is more, America is no longer prepared to put its weight behind its supposed ally, the Afghan government, to the surprise and dismay of many Afghan officials. Hostile regimes in places like China and Russia will have taken note—as will America’s friends.
That does not make Afghanistan a second Vietnam. For one thing, the Afghan war  was never really  the Pentagon’s or the nation’s focus. American troops were on the ground far longer in Afghanistan than they were in Vietnam, but far fewer of them died. Other events, from the war in Iraq to the global financial crisis, always seemed more important than what was happening in Kandahar. And American politicians and pundits have agonised over whether to stay or go for so long that, now the withdrawal has finally arrived, it has lost its power to shock. To the extent that outsiders see it as a sign of American weakness, that weakness has been evident for a long time.

UNHAPPY THINGS
Shocking or not, though, the withdrawal is nonetheless a calamity for the people of Afghanistan. In 2001 many hoped that America might end their 20-year-old civil war and free them from a stifling, doctrinaire theocracy. For a time, it looked as though that might happen. But today the lives of ordinary Afghans are more insecure than ever: civilian casualties were almost 30% higher last year than in 2001, when the American deployment began, according to estimates from the  UN  and academics. The economy is no bigger than it was a decade ago. And the mullahs are not only at the gates of Kabul; their assassins are inside, targeting Shias, secularists, women with important jobs—anyone who offends their blinkered worldview. America was never going to solve all Afghanistan’s problems, but to leave the country back at square one is a sobering failure.  ■

28,217446,POLITICO,2016-09-01,"THE LAST-MILE PROBLEM IN AFGHANISTAN — Today was the first time the Pentagon put a number on the progress of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, after President Joe Biden’s May announcement of the decision to pull the troops.
The U.S. military has officially completed 90 percent of its withdrawal from Afghanistan, the U.S. Central Command said today. The White House said the final drawdown will be completed by the end of August.
The political ramifications of the end of America’s first post-9/11 war are hard to predict. The Taliban is taking hold again in Afghanistan, bolsteredby the U.S. military’s exit. And Russian President Vladimir Putin could interfere with the Biden administration’s post-withdrawal agenda, Defense reporter Lara Seligman reported today.
Nightly chatted with Lara over Slack about what today’s progress report means, and what to watch for in the coming weeks as the Biden administration completes the withdrawal.
You had an interesting tweet, pointing out that the 90 percent figure raises the question about why the last 10 percent is going to take until the end of August. Why the long timeline?
A few reasons: 1) They don’t want to announce that the withdrawal has already effectively been completed for fear that the Taliban will use that news as an excuse to launch an even stronger offensive.
2) They want to keep some contractors around as long as possible to help out the Afghans, for instance those currently helping with maintenance for the Afghan air force. Experts fear the security forces may collapse without the support of these contractors.
3) It also gives the administration more time to finalize plans to relocate thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. military as interpreters, etc., and are awaiting their special immigrant visas. These Afghans are in danger of being killed by the Taliban after the U.S. officially leaves.
4) Keeping the commander around and at least the illusion of a U.S. military presence is, if nothing else, a morale boost for the Afghan security forces.
5) It also gives them more time to hammer out the details of how to provide security at Kabul international airport, which is now the main gateway for diplomats and humanitarian aid workers into Afghanistan. The Biden administration is trying to work out a deal with the Turks right now to keep up to 1,000 troops there to provide security.
What do we know about what’s happening on the ground with the Taliban, as U.S. forces continue to leave the region? How are the Afghan security forces holding up?
Not well. According to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which tracks the conflict closely, in the last six days alone the Taliban has taken control of 10 percent of the country, most of it in critical northern areas. That means that overall the Taliban now controls 188 of the country’s 407 districts and contests another 135. We are seeing the Afghan security forces surrender many of their bases without a fight.
What are experts saying the scenarios are for how this will play out over the course of the summer, once the U.S. completes its withdrawal? I saw one of your sources warned Afghanistan is “at risk of complete collapse.”
Yes, some intelligence reports indicate that the government in Kabul could fall to the Taliban in as little as six months to two years after the U.S. withdraws. One of my sources says Kabul is secure as long as the morale of the Afghan National Security Forces holds — but if that breaks the country could fall quickly. And the reports about the Afghans surrendering without a fight, and others that some soldiers have fled to Tajikistan, are not encouraging.
As you’ve reported, the U.S. is still trying to keep an eye on Afghanistan — potentially from a Central Asian country. Why is Russia an obstacle to this?
In a nutshell, Russia has significant economic and military influence in all the neighboring countries the U.S. is looking at to potentially host U.S. troops — namely the “stan” countries like Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. Twenty years ago, these countries were concerned about the terrorist threat emanating from Afghanistan and were happy to help out — the U.S. used to have bases in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. But now the threat has diminished, and the relationship between Washington and Moscow is at an all-time low. Moscow will not look kindly on U.S. boots on the ground in the Central Asian states, which it considers its own area of operations. And these countries basically require at least tacit approval from Russia because they are heavily dependent on Moscow for economic support and military aid.
So if Putin refuses to give this approval, what’s left for the Biden admin to do to help ensure Kabul doesn’t fall?
The military insists we can still maintain overwatch in Afghanistan to keep the Taliban in check and hunt down any terrorist cells that crop up from far-away bases in the Middle East and ships in the Persian Gulf. But experts say this plan is not realistic — it’s a nine-hour flight from Qatar to Afghanistan, and not at all clear that this is feasible for the unmanned aircraft the Pentagon plans to rely on for surveillance.

— Pentagon cancels massive JEDI cloud contract:The Pentagon canceled its JEDI cloud contract today, ending a chapter in the department’s yearslong quest to stitch together classified networks that saw a public battle between tech giants and accusations that former President Donald Trump sullied the process. The decision to cancel the contract and head in a new direction comes a year after a federal court ruled that the Pentagon stop work on the contract, which went to Microsoft in 2019. The court last year sided with former bidder Amazon, which argued in a 2019 lawsuit that it lost the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, contract to Microsoft because Trump derided the company and its founder, Jeff Bezos.
— Germany arrests suspected double agent accused of spying for China:German authorities arrested a former spy for Germany’s secret service on suspicions that he conducted “intelligence agent activities” for China, the federal prosecutor’s office said today.

— Key player in Gaetz probe seeks sentencing delay so he can keep cooperating with feds:A key figure in the ongoing federal sex-crime investigation into Rep. Matt Gaetz is seeking to delay his sentencing as he continues to cooperate with prosecutors. Joel Greenberg, a former Seminole County tax collector who in May pleaded guilty to sex trafficking and corruption-related charges, requested in a motion filed today a delay in his sentencing, which is scheduled for August 19. Prosecutors are not opposing the motion, court records show. He faces a minimum of 12 years in prison.
— Biden faces ‘moment of reckoning’ over sprawling Russian cyber assault: The cyberattack on IT management software maker Kaseya, which may have affected as many as 1,500 companies whose vendors were using Kaseya’s product, prompted emergency meetings over the weekend between the FBI, DHS’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other agencies, as officials scrambled to assess the scale of the damage.
FRANCE READY TO GET LAX ON TAX — France is ready to make a binding promise to the U.S. to remove a national tax on digital giants as soon as a new global taxation deal is in force, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said today, Giorgio Leali writes.
But he hinted the international deal would have no impact on the EU’s plans for a separate digital levy, due to be published July 20 but under heavy fire from Washington.
“I am prepared to make a formal, legally binding, commitment in the draft budget law to indicate to our American friends that the day the OECD tax is implemented, the national tax ... disappears,” Le Maire told reporters.
His pledge comes ahead of a meeting of finance ministers from the G-20 in Venice later this week, at which the club of rich countries is expected to agree on new international rules to tax large companies. Last week, 130 countries reached a first technical agreement at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The U.S. has made clear that in exchange for the global deal, it expected European countries to withdraw any individual digital tax initiatives.
CHAMPAGNE WISHES, CAVIAR SCHEMES — As geopolitical food fights go, Putin’s assault on French Champagne might well be described as Extra Brut.
The Russian president signed a law on Friday that will ban foreign sparkling wine producers from using the term “Champagne” — even those produced in France's famed, wine-growing region from which the name originates, Sarah Anne Aarup writes. Only Russian-made shampanskoe wines will be able to use the term.
The move was viewed as a major affront in France, which has strict rules to protect the name and reputation of its beloved bubbly, and the country's main Champagne industry group called on Monday for all producers to halt exports to Russia “until further notice.”
“The people of Champagne are calling on French and European diplomacy to try to have this unacceptable law modified,” reads the statement from the Champagne Committee's co-presidents, Maxime Toubart and Jean-Marie Barillère. “Preventing the people of Champagne from using the name Champagne (in Cyrillic) is scandalous; it’s our common heritage and the apple of our eye.”

29,217447,SFGATE,2016-09-01,"“We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build,” Biden said in a speech from the White House’s East Room. “Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future.”
The administration in recent days has sought to frame ending the conflict as a decision that Biden made after concluding it’s an “unwinnable war” and one that “does not have a military solution.” On Thursday he amplified the justification of his decision even as the Taliban make rapid advances in significant swaths of the country.
“How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters and sons are you willing to risk?” Biden said to those calling for the U.S. to extend the military operation. He added, “I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.""
The new withdrawal date comes after former President Donald Trump’s administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban to end the U.S. military mission by May 1. Biden after taking office announced U.S. troops would be out by by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack, which al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden plotted from Afghanistan, where he had been given refuge by the Taliban.
With U.S. and NATO ally forces rapidly drawing down in the past week, there was growing speculation that U.S. combat operations have already effectively ended. But by setting Aug. 31 as the drawdown date, the administration nodded to the reality that the long war is in its final phase, while providing itself some cushion to deal with outstanding matters.
The administration has yet to complete talks with Turkey on an arrangement for maintaining security at the Kabul airport and is still ironing out details for the potential evacuation of thousands of Afghans who assisted the U.S. military operation.
Biden said that prolonging U.S. military involvement, considering Trump had already agreed to withdraw U.S. troops, would have led to an escalation of attacks on American troops and NATO allies.
“The Taliban would have again begun to target our forces,” Biden said. “The status quo was not an option. Staying meant U.S. troops taking casualties. American men and women. Back in the middle of a civil war. And we would run the risk of having to send more troops back in Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops.”
The president added that there is no “mission accomplished” moment as the U.S. war comes to an end.
“The mission was accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,"" he said. U.S. forces killed bin Laden in 2011.
U.S. forces this week vacated Bagram Airfield — the U.S. epicenter of the conflict to oust the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 2001 terrorist attacks that triggered the war.
Remaining U.S. troops are now concentrated in Kabul, the capital. The Pentagon said the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Scott Miller, is expected to end his tour of duty this month as final arrangements are made for a reduced U.S. military mission.
Biden, answering questions from reporters after his remarks on Thursday, said that Kabul falling to the Taliban would not be an acceptable outcome. The president also pushed back against the notion that such a scenario was certain.
“Do I trust the Taliban? No,"" Biden said. “But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped and more competent in terms of conducting war.”
To be certain, the West hopes Taliban gains will be confined mostly to rural areas, with the Afghan government and its allies retaining control of the cities where much of Afghanistan’s population resides. And while the Taliban remain a major power in Afghanistan, the government’s supporters hope that Afghans will work out the Taliban role in the post-U.S. Afghanistan power structure more through political than military means, partly through the inducements of international legitimacy, aid and other support.
Asked by a reporter whether rampant corruption within the Afghan government contributed to the failure of achieving the sort of stability that his predecessors and American military commanders envisioned, Biden didn’t exactly dismiss the notion. “The mission hasn’t failed — yet.""
Biden continues to face pressure from congressional lawmakers to offer further detail on how he intends to go about assisting thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. military as translators, drivers and in other jobs. Many are fearful they will be targets of the Taliban once the U.S. withdrawal is complete.
The White House says the administration has identified U.S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as third countries, where evacuated Afghans would potentially stay while their visa applications are processed. Biden added that 2,500 Afghans have been granted special immigrant visas since he took office in January.
Still, the president faced Republican criticism following his speech.
“The Taliban is gaining more ground by the day, and there are targets on the backs of our people and our partners,” said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “But rather than taking the opportunity to reassure the American people there are sufficient plans in place to keep American diplomats and our Afghan partners safe, President Biden only offered more empty promises and no detailed plan of action.”
John Kirby, chief Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday that the U.S. military is considering several overseas bases around the world as possible temporary locations for those Afghans awaiting a visa. So far, he said, the numbers of those who have decided to leave Afghanistan are not so high that they can’t be handled with a range of installations.
“Our message to those women and men is clear,” Biden said. “There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose. We will stand with you, just as you stood with us.”
Biden noted that as a senator he was skeptical about how much the U.S. could accomplish in Afghanistan and had advocated for a more narrowly tailored mission. He was somewhat opaque in answering whether the cost of the war was worth it, but argued that the U.S. objectives were completed long ago.
“We went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as I said at the time,"" Biden said. ""The second reason was to eliminate al-Qaida’s capacity to deal with more attacks on the United States from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives. Period.
“That’s why I believe this is the right decision and quite frankly overdue.”

Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “But rather than taking the opportunity to reassure the American people there are sufficient plans in place to keep American diplomats and our Afghan partners safe, President Biden only offered more empty promises and no detailed plan of action.”
John Kirby, chief Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday that the U.S. military is considering several overseas bases around the world as possible temporary locations for those Afghans awaiting a visa. So far, he said, the numbers of those who have decided to leave Afghanistan are not so high that they can’t be handled with a range of installations.
“Our message to those women and men is clear,” Biden said. “There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose. We will stand with you, just as you stood with us.”
Biden noted that as a senator he was skeptical about how much the U.S. could accomplish in Afghanistan and had advocated for a more narrowly tailored mission. He was somewhat opaque in answering whether the cost of the war was worth it, but argued that the U.S. objectives were completed long ago.
“We went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as I said at the time,” Biden said. “The second reason was to eliminate al-Qaida’s capacity to deal with more attacks on the United States from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives. Period.
“That’s why I believe this is the right decision and quite frankly overdue.”

""I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome,” said the president.

— ABC News (@ABC)  July 8, 2021 The president’s formal address comes as Taliban forces have made rapid gains in Afghanistan over the past several weeks as US forces have withdrawn from long-held positions in the country, including Bagram Air Base where the US reportedly left thousands of prisoners including Taliban and Al Qaeda militants, and pulled out in the middle of the night without informing their Afghan counterparts.
Roughly 90 per cent of US forces have already left the country, and the remainder are expected to leave by August 31.
The president also addressed his administration’s plan to house Afghan citizens who served as translators or interpreters for US forces. He and White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed at separate events that those Afghans will be flown out of the country before the end of August, and Mr Biden pledged that the US would be a home for them if they so desired.
“There is a home for you in the US if you so choose,” Mr Biden said on Thursday, addressing the Afghans.
The programme is expected to provide refuge for thousands of Afghans who fear reprisal from the Taliban following the US pullout.
But the Taliban, Mr Biden, added, lack the capability to overwhelm Afghanistan’s government and do not pose a significant threat of taking over. He rejected comparisons to the Vietnam War, which ended with a defeated US launching a hasty evacuation of US personnel and South Vietnamese allies in the face of a North Vietnamese invasion.
“The Taliban is not the North Vietnamese Army. They're not remotely comparable in terms of capability,” Mr Biden asserted. “There's going to be no circumstances where you’re going to see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy in the United States from Afghanistan.”
Mr Biden initially said that the US would pull out of Afghanistan by September 11, which would mark the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The deadline was several months past a target previously set by the Trump administration for a full withdrawal.
Afghanistan has become the US’s longest-running war, costing the country more than $2 trillion in military expenses and causing the deaths of more than 2,400 US service members and tens of thousands of Afghan citizens."

WASHINGTON: President  Joe Biden  on Thursday said the US military mission in  Afghanistan  will conclude on Aug. 31, saying ""speed is safety"" as the United States seeks to end the nearly 20-year war. ""We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build,""  Biden  said in a speech to update his administration's ongoing efforts to wind down the US war in Afghanistan. ""Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future."" Biden also amplified the justification of his decision to end US military operations even as the  Taliban  make rapid advances in significant swaths of the country.

The effort to further explain his thinking on Afghanistan comes as the administration in recent days has repeatedly sought to frame ending the conflict as a decision that Biden made after concluding it's an ""unwinnable war"" and one that ""does not have a military solution."" ""How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters and sons are you willing to risk?"" Biden said to those calling for the US to extend the military operation. He added, ""I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.""

Biden said he didn't trust the Taliban but trusted the capacity of the Afghan military to defend the government. Before his speech,  White House  press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden administration officials always anticipated an ""uptick"" in violence and greater turmoil as the US withdrawal moved forward. She added that prolonging US military involvement, considering former President Donald Trump had already agreed to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan by May 2021, would have led to an escalation of attacks on American troops.

""The question fundamentally facing him was after 20 years was he going to commit more American troops to a civil war in Afghanistan,"" Psaki said. Biden said it was ""highly unlikely"" that one government will control Afghanistan after the US pullout, and urged the Afghan government to reach a deal with the Taliban.

The president added that there is no ""mission accomplished"" moment as the US war comes to an end. ""The mission was accomplished in that we got  Osama bin Laden  and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,"" he said.

37,217455,BostonGlobe.com,2016-09-01,"“We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build,” Biden said in a speech from the White House’s East Room. “Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future.”
The administration in recent days has sought to frame ending the conflict as a decision that Biden made after concluding it’s an “unwinnable war” and one that “does not have a military solution.” On Thursday he amplified the justification of his decision even as the Taliban make rapid advances in significant swaths of the country.
“How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters and sons are you willing to risk?” Biden said to those calling for the U.S. to extend the military operation. He added, “I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.”
The new withdrawal date comes after former President Donald Trump’s administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban to end the U.S. military mission by May 1. Biden after taking office announced U.S. troops would be out by by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack, which al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden plotted from Afghanistan, where he had been given refuge by the Taliban.
With U.S. and NATO ally forces rapidly drawing down in the past week, there was growing speculation that U.S. combat operations have already effectively ended. But by setting Aug. 31 as the drawdown date, the administration nodded to the reality that the long war is in its final phase, while providing itself some cushion to deal with outstanding matters.
The administration has yet to complete talks with Turkey on an arrangement for maintaining security at the Kabul airport and is still ironing out details for the potential evacuation of thousands of Afghans who assisted the U.S. military operation.
Biden said that prolonging U.S. military involvement, considering Trump had already agreed to withdraw U.S. troops, would have led to an escalation of attacks on American troops and NATO allies.
“The Taliban would have again begun to target our forces,” Biden said. “The status quo was not an option. Staying meant U.S. troops taking casualties. American men and women. Back in the middle of a civil war. And we would run the risk of having to send more troops back in Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops.”
The president added that there is no “mission accomplished” moment as the U.S. war comes to an end.
“The mission was accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,” he said. U.S. forces killed bin Laden in 2011.
U.S. forces this week vacated Bagram Airfield — the U.S. epicenter of the conflict to oust the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 2001 terrorist attacks that triggered the war.
Remaining U.S. troops are now concentrated in Kabul, the capital. The Pentagon said the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Scott Miller, is expected to end his tour of duty this month as final arrangements are made for a reduced U.S. military mission.
Biden, answering questions from reporters after his remarks on Thursday, said that Kabul falling to the Taliban would not be an acceptable outcome. The president also pushed back against the notion that such a scenario was certain.
“Do I trust the Taliban? No,” Biden said. “But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped and more competent in terms of conducting war.”
To be certain, the West hopes Taliban gains will be confined mostly to rural areas, with the Afghan government and its allies retaining control of the cities where much of Afghanistan’s population resides. And while the Taliban remain a major power in Afghanistan, the government’s supporters hope that Afghans will work out the Taliban role in the post-U.S. Afghanistan power structure more through political than military means, partly through the inducements of international legitimacy, aid and other support.
Asked by a reporter whether rampant corruption within the Afghan government contributed to the failure of achieving the sort of stability that his predecessors and American military commanders envisioned, Biden didn’t exactly dismiss the notion. “The mission hasn’t failed — yet.”
Biden continues to face pressure from congressional lawmakers to offer further detail on how he intends to go about assisting thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. military as translators, drivers and in other jobs. Many are fearful they will be targets of the Taliban once the U.S. withdrawal is complete.
The White House says the administration has identified U.S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as third countries, where evacuated Afghans would potentially stay while their visa applications are processed. Biden added that 2,500 Afghans have been granted special immigrant visas since he took office in January.
Still, the president faced Republican criticism following his speech.
“The Taliban is gaining more ground by the day, and there are targets on the backs of our people and our partners,” said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “But rather than taking the opportunity to reassure the American people there are sufficient plans in place to keep American diplomats and our Afghan partners safe, President Biden only offered more empty promises and no detailed plan of action.”

Biden pushed back against the notion the U.S. mission has failed but also noted that it remains unlikely the government would control all of Afghanistan after the U.S. leaves. He urged the Afghan government and Taliban, which he said remains as formidable as it did before the start of the war, to come to a peace agreement.
""We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build,"" Biden said in a speech from the White House´s East Room. ""Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future.""
The administration in recent days has sought to frame ending the conflict as a decision that Biden made after concluding it´s an ""unwinnable war"" and one that ""does not have a military solution."" On Thursday he amplified the justification of his decision even as the Taliban make rapid advances in significant swaths of the country.
""How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters and sons are you willing to risk?"" Biden said to those calling for the U.S. to extend the military operation. He added, ""I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.""
The new withdrawal date comes after former President Donald Trump´s administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban to end the U.S. military mission by May 1. Biden after taking office announced U.S. troops would be out by by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack, which al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden plotted from Afghanistan, where he had been given refuge by the Taliban.

With U.S. and NATO ally forces rapidly drawing down in the past week, there was growing speculation that U.S. combat operations have already effectively ended. But by setting Aug. 31 as the drawdown date, the administration nodded to the reality that the long war is in its final phase, while providing itself some cushion to deal with outstanding matters.
The administration has yet to complete talks with Turkey on an arrangement for maintaining security at the Kabul airport and is still ironing out details for the potential evacuation of thousands of Afghans who assisted the U.S. military operation.
Biden said that prolonging U.S. military involvement, considering Trump had already agreed to withdraw U.S. troops, would have led to an escalation of attacks on American troops and NATO allies.
""The Taliban would have again begun to target our forces,"" Biden said. ""The status quo was not an option. Staying meant U.S. troops taking casualties. American men and women. Back in the middle of a civil war. And we would run the risk of having to send more troops back in Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops.""
The president added that there is no ""mission accomplished"" moment as the U.S. war comes to an end.
""The mission was accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,"" he said. U.S. forces killed bin Laden in 2011.
U.S. forces this week vacated Bagram Airfield - the U.S. epicenter of the conflict to oust the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 2001 terrorist attacks that triggered the war.
Remaining U.S. troops are now concentrated in Kabul, the capital. The Pentagon said the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Scott Miller, is expected to end his tour of duty this month as final arrangements are made for a reduced U.S. military mission.
Biden, answering questions from reporters after his remarks on Thursday, said that Kabul falling to the Taliban would not be an acceptable outcome. The president also pushed back against the notion that such a scenario was certain.
""Do I trust the Taliban? No,"" Biden said. ""But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped and more competent in terms of conducting war.""
To be certain, the West hopes Taliban gains will be confined mostly to rural areas, with the Afghan government and its allies retaining control of the cities where much of Afghanistan´s population resides. And while the Taliban remain a major power in Afghanistan, the government´s supporters hope that Afghans will work out the Taliban role in the post-U.S. Afghanistan power structure more through political than military means, partly through the inducements of international legitimacy, aid and other support.
Asked by a reporter whether rampant corruption within the Afghan government contributed to the failure of achieving the sort of stability that his predecessors and American military commanders envisioned, Biden didn´t exactly dismiss the notion. ""The mission hasn´t failed - yet.""
Biden continues to face pressure from congressional lawmakers to offer further detail on how he intends to go about assisting thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. military as translators, drivers and in other jobs. Many are fearful they will be targets of the Taliban once the U.S. withdrawal is complete.
The White House says the administration has identified U.S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as third countries, where evacuated Afghans would potentially stay while their visa applications are processed. Biden added that 2,500 Afghans have been granted special immigrant visas since he took office in January.
Still, the president faced Republican criticism following his speech.
""The Taliban is gaining more ground by the day, and there are targets on the backs of our people and our partners,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""But rather than taking the opportunity to reassure the American people there are sufficient plans in place to keep American diplomats and our Afghan partners safe, President Biden only offered more empty promises and no detailed plan of action.""
John Kirby, chief Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday that the U.S. military is considering several overseas bases around the world as possible temporary locations for those Afghans awaiting a visa. So far, he said, the numbers of those who have decided to leave Afghanistan are not so high that they can´t be handled with a range of installations.
""Our message to those women and men is clear,"" Biden said. ""There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose. We will stand with you, just as you stood with us.""
Biden noted that as a senator he was skeptical about how much the U.S. could accomplish in Afghanistan and had advocated for a more narrowly tailored mission. He was somewhat opaque in answering whether the cost of the war was worth it, but argued that the U.S. objectives were completed long ago.
""We went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as I said at the time,"" Biden said. ""The second reason was to eliminate al-Qaida´s capacity to deal with more attacks on the United States from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives. Period.
""That´s why I believe this is the right decision and quite frankly overdue.""

47,217465,@YahooNews,2016-09-01,"President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday that the U.S. military mission in  Afghanistan  will come to end by August 31.
“We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build,” Biden said Thursday at the White House.
“It’s up to the Afghans to make decisions about the future of their country,” Biden said.
The speech comes as the administration has attempted to frame the troop withdrawal as a decision that was made in light of the president’s conclusion that the conflict is an “unwinnable war” that “does not have a military solution”
“How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters and sons are you willing to risk?” Biden said in response to calls for the U.S. to continue the military operation.
“I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome,” he added.
Biden said that while he does not trust the Taliban, he trusts the ability of the Afghan military to defend the government.
“They clearly have the capacity to keep the government in place, the question is will they come together, and will they do it,” he said, noting that the U.S. had trained and equipped 300,000 Afghan troops in the past 20 years.
The announcement comes after the president announced in April the planned departure of U.S. forces.
Ahead of Biden’s remarks, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden administration officials expect an “uptick” in violence and greater turmoil as the United States’ withdrawal advances but argued that continuing U.S. military involvement would have led to an escalation of attacks on American troops.
“The question fundamentally facing him was after 20 years was he going to commit more American troops to a civil war in Afghanistan,” Psaki said.
On Thursday, Biden said it is “highly unlikely” that one government will control Afghanistan after the U.S. pullout. He called on the Afghan government to reach a deal with the Taliban.
The president said there is no “mission accomplished” moment as the U.S. mission reaches an end.
“The mission was accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,” he said.

48,217466,Mashable,2016-09-01,"Let us, the custodians of the news cycle, be the first to say it: A dense academic theory from the 1970s doesn't just find its way into the news at random.
That's another way of saying there's a reason you've likely seen the words ""critical race theory"" in headlines lately. Critical race theory (CRT) is an analytical framework used by legal scholars to study systemic, institutional racism but that's not necessarily how it's being used in its current spurt in prominence.
In recent months, Republicans have introduced dozens of bills in state legislatures attempting to put limits on what educators can and cannot teach with respect to allegedly ""divisive"" concepts, many of which concern race. The language of the bills varies slightly, but a majority seem to be fueled, in large part, by a growing fear among conservatives over ""critical race theory,"" which Republican leaders have used as something of a catch-all term to describe any mention of race or racism in academic and governmental settings.
To date, at least five states (Oklahoma, Texas, Idaho, Iowa, and Tennessee) have already passed laws intended to curtail certain classroom discussions pertaining to what they're calling ""critical race theory."" And conservative panic about critical race theory transcends national boundaries: The Australian Senate has alsovoted to eliminate critical race theory from its national curriculum. In the U.S., Republican leaders have particularly been incensed by an inaccurate notion that critical race theory teaches white students that they're all innately racist, and that they should feel guilty.
The current uproar has stark implications for what's taught in classrooms, who wins future elections, and broader culture wars so here's what you need to know about the three simple words dominating tweets, headlines, and school board meetings right now.
For starters, it's not something that would ever be taught in a kindergarten classroom, despite the repeated focus on banning critical race theory in K-12 schools, Dr. Khiara Bridges, a law professor at UC Berkeley and author of Critical Race Theory: A Primer, says. ""Critical race theory is a legal theory that emerged in law schools in the 1970s, 1980s,"" she says. ""It was a response to the perceived, and I would say, obvious failures of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.""
At that time, major pieces of legislation intended to achieve some version of racial equality had just passed as a result of the Civil Rights Movement yet racial inequality remained rampant. For a group of legal scholars, including Derrick Bell and his then-student Kimberl� Crenshaw, who later also coined the term intersectionality, which refers to the way identities like race and gender intersect, the question became...""why?"" Critical race theory emerged to interrogate that question, Bridges explains. As a framework, critical race theory often focuses on the idea that racism is systemic, and fundamentally steeped in the legal system.
Take an injustice like the Flint Water Crisis. As Bridges also notes in her book, some would say that race is merely a descriptor when discussing what happened in Flint, arguing that it cannot be used to explain why those who were exposed to contaminated drinking water were predominantly Black people.
A critical race theorist studying the topic, however, would analyze the historical factors that led to the crisis primarily impacting Black people, with their studies grounded in the idea that racial injustice is built into society's foundational building blocks.
Bridges points out that the framework has since evolved to ""analyze multiple questions around law and racial inequality,"" spanning topics like affirmative action, the criminal justice system, and racial disparities in health. Dr. Keffrelyn Brown, a professor of cultural studies in education at the University of Texas, Austin, adds that as an analytical framework, critical race theory also extends beyond legal studies now, ""and it's been applied in different disciplinary areas, including education. It is simply an explanatory framework for the history and present day conditions of race and racism.""
To truly understand the term, it's important to dwell a bit on the word ""theory."" Critical race theory isn't like a scientific theory that can be tested with an experiment (and answered with a right or wrong answer). It is more like Foucault's theory of power, which provides a clarifying framework for conceptualizing ""power"" in different contexts another concept kindergarteners are not constantly learning about, Bridges explains. ""Those things aren't falsifiable at all,"" she says. ""Rather, it's a theory for how to look at and understand society, how to explain society.""
As a result, Bridges stresses that there are plenty of disagreements among critical race theorists for example, whether to focus on ""institutions, structures, and macro level processes"" (which she does) rather than on, say, implicit bias, which ""directs us to interrogate individuals"" while ignoring ""the structures under which these individuals exist,"" she says. ""There's a lot of contention within the theory, and that's what makes it better,"" Bridges adds. ""Whenever somebody in good faith questions my scholarship&it makes my scholarship better.""

HOW DID CRITICAL RACE THEORY BECOME CONTROVERSIAL?
For decades, critical race theory primarily lived in the hallowed halls of academia. So how did it suddenly end up in school board meetings, on Twitter, and all over the news? And why are people up in arms about it?
The short answer is that timing matters and so does language itself. Bridges says that in her book, Critical Race Theory: A Primer, she had observed that there might be something ""easily exploitable about the fact the theory calls itself 'critical race theory,'"" because it's incredibly broad. ""It kind of makes it hard to point to something and say, 'there [critical race theory] is,'"" she says.
Tweet may have been deletedKimberl� Crenshaw ultimately coined the phrase, and Bridges wonders ""if, in 40 years hindsight, she wishes that she had said something like, 'critical legal studies of law,' like just [built] law in there somewhere, so that this theory could be anchored to the law.""
In any case, even if the concept got its roots in legal studies, that's not how it's currently being used by many conservatives right now. Some critical race theorists, Crenshaw and Bridges included, see the foundations for the current conservative backlash around critical race theory in the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. During that time, many businesses, schools, and other organizations offered anti-racist seminars and trainings, and an overall cultural shift seemed to have trickled down to even the most mundane places.
""I woke up one morning in May, and I had an email from my yoga studio telling me that they were going to 'do better' when it came to racial justice,"" Bridges says. ""I went on Amazon to order some toilet paper, and Amazon told me that Black Lives mattered.""
In the view of some scholars and analysts, that provided fertile ground for waging a culture war from those who appeared to be threatened by increased public understanding about white supremacy, anti-Blackness, and systemic racism. ""Trump was eyeing November 2020 at the same time, trying to get re-elected, and we all know that he leveraged those protests to make it into something like Black Lives Matter versus everyone else& American versus 'un-American' people; radicals versus people who love this country,"" Bridges says.
Around the same time, the conservative activist Christopher Rufo was critiquing certain anti-racist training modules, inaccurately arguing they were endorsing ""segregationism"" and ""group-based guilt."" When discussing them on conservative news shows, he started using the term ""critical race theory,"" which he discovered when following the footnotes on certain texts.
Rufo assisted in drafting a memo issued by former President Trump in September 2020 that barred federal agencies from conducting training on topics concerning ""critical race theory"" and ""white privilege,"" (President Biden has since rescinded the ban.) Meanwhile, Trump was also stridently critical of the 1619 Project, a journalism effort from the New York Times that chronicles the impact of chattel slavery on U.S. history. (A small group of historians have critiqued aspects of the project, but by and large it's seen as a crucially educational endeavor, with its creator Nikole Hannah-Jones winning a Pulitzer Prize for her work.) Trump referenced the project in an alarmist diatribe against critical race theory that misinterpreted the concept.
All told, it seemed as if conservatives had found an ominous specter critical race theory to unite around, even if the term was being used in a way largely divorced from its academic meaning. Conservatives have particularly taken issue with critical race theory's concept of systemic racism, claiming that teaching critical race theory in schools (more on that in a second) amounts to teaching kids that their country is ""fundamentally and irredeemably racist,"" and that ""every white person is a racist,"" as Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, recently said it did. (Bridges and Brown both clarify that this interpretation of ""critical race theory"" is not within the academic scholarship.)
It'll be years, Bridges notes, before scholars like herself truly understand the full picture behind the current public conversation concerning critical race theory, particularly because we're in the middle of a battle over politicized language that has yet to fully unfold.
In any case, there is evidence to suggest the term ""critical race theory"" was intentionally weaponized to some degree, at least by the originator of its current explosion in usage. Rufo told the New Yorker about his specific use of the term ""critical race theory,"" saying that ""...cancel culture is a vacuous term and doesnt translate into a political program; woke is a good epithet, but its too broad, too terminal, too easily brushed aside. Critical race theory is the perfect villain."" He also tweeted that ""the goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think 'critical race theory.'""
Tweet may have been deletedOthers don't necessarily see the progression so linearly, but agree that the way critical race theory is being misunderstood in the public eye has major implications, regardless of how it ended up on the tip of everyone's tongues. ""I think that there are many different entry points that one could use to talk about why we ended up at this place,"" Brown says. She says that an increased recognition of racial violence, such as George Floyd's murder, led to ""a lot of attention being placed on trying to understand racism not as simply something one person does to another person, but a real systemic and structural problem.""
""I think it is not surprising that critical race theory is becoming a catch-all phrase for any effort that is an attempt to understand diversity, inclusion, and equity all things we've made some progress in,"" she continues. ""We've made some progress in addressing those issues in schools and in society, and as a result, we've got this pushback.""

WAIT, SO ARE SCHOOLS GOING TO STOP TEACHING ABOUT RACE BECAUSE OF ""CRITICAL RACE THEORY"" BILLS?
Not necessarily but the bills and the conservative uproar around critical race theory do have serious implications for anyone who cares about the fate of lessons about systemic racism in schools.
Brown and Bridges both agree there's essentially zero chance that critical race theory, as it's understood as a graduate-level analytical framework, is actually being taught in any K-12 classroom in the country. As the slate of anti-CRT bills proves, though, that hasn't stopped efforts to turn the heightened focus on critical race theory into an issue for school boards, parents, and students to debate. (And lately, that debate has frequently turned to chaos at school board meetings.)
""I do not believe, nor do I have any evidence of any content standards, curriculum standards, that lay out the need for teachers to teach critical race theory,"" Brown says. She explains that there may be teachers who understand critical race theory themselves, and ""may use that as an explanatory framework to help them make sense of what's there, but they're not teaching critical race theory as a theoretical framework."" In short, it's possible that a teacher's background understanding of critical race theory could inform how they explain a lesson about ""the role racism has played historically"" in, say, a social studies course, but Brown maintains she doesn't know ""of really any K-12 schools that teach about theoretical frameworks.""
There's no unified national curriculum for public schools in the U.S., though Common Core State Standards provide some uniform standards for math and English. That said, states and school districts can determine education standards on a smaller scale, which is where anti-CRT bills are being introduced. In the past, this curriculum model has led to discrepancies in what kinds of historical lessons are taught around the U.S., including language used in schools concerning the Civil War.
""This isn't the first time that there's been debate, contention, and controversy placed on curriculum,"" Brown adds. ""In fact, I would say curriculum is one of the prime places where political battles have been waged, at least since the 1800s, and definitely since the emergence of widespread, K-12 public education, with the understanding that what students are taught is viewed as potentially powerful.""
Right now, it stands to be seen how much the bills will actually impact classrooms. The legal standing for many of these bills is faulty, legal scholars say, and they stand to face challenges in court due to their limits on free speech. At its core, the conservative pushback around teaching anything about racism points to a larger attempt to obscure the ugliest parts of our country's history, and Bridges and Brown say anyone interested in having young people educated about race, power, and inequality should stay vigilant about keeping those kinds of lessons in schools.
""I think at least one of the aims of the bills is just to create enough confusion and fear on the part of some parents, and on the part of some educators, to just not do this work,"" Brown says. ""So, if you don't do the work, you've accomplished the aim of not actually addressing racism.""

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU WANT LESSONS ABOUT RACE AND RACISM TO STAY IN SCHOOLS?
First of all, say it. That means showing up at school board meetings, writing letters and emails to education officials, and/or reaching out to your congressperson, particularly as critical race theory continues to dominate the conversation. ""You need to let your school districts know that you want your children to understand racism, but more importantly, they also need to be talking about diversity and equity,"" Bridges says. ""I don't know what the lasting impact will be of these efforts,"" she adds. ""It's not the first time that multiculturalism and diversity have been challenged [in school curricula]. I don't think it will be the last time, and I don't think that it will go away. But I do think that it will lead to a conversation. For those of us that know [teaching students about race] is important work&we have to stand up for its relevance and importance.""
Bridges, meanwhile, is optimistic that if we can move away from the ""ridiculous"" notion that ""critical race theory in K-12 schools means that everybody is going to be taught that every single white person is racist,"" we might instead ""enter a dialogue as a nation about how&K-12 schools should introduce concepts like systemic racism, like structural racism, like intersectionality.""
""That's a much more productive conversation than 'let's keep critical race theory out of K-12 schools,'"" she continues. ""How about we engage in these democratic discussions around what we think kids should learn, and how. I think that would be much more productive, and much more American, than simply banning ideas."""
49,217467,VOA,2016-09-01,"WHAT IS CRITICAL RACE THEORY?
Over the past few months in the United States, the expression “critical race theory,” or CRT, has appeared in statehouses and political gatherings from almost nowhere.
CRT has become an important cause for conservatives  .  Many Republican-controlled states have passed legislation restricting how history and race can be taught in public schools.
For some, critical race theory is a way of understanding how race has shaped American society and public policy. For others, CRT creates division and conflict between white people and minorities.
But even those who criticize critical race theory have a hard time defining what it is. So, what exactly is it?
What is critical race theory?
Critical race theory is a way of thinking about America’s history through race. It argues that racism is more than just individual  prejudices  and discrimination.
CRT centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the country’s  institutions  . The theory also argues that the country’s institutions work to keep white people as the most powerful group. University professors, and others in  academia  , developed CRT during the 1970s and 1980s in response to what they viewed as a lack of racial progress.
The creators of the theory argue that the U.S. was founded on stolen land and labor, through the colonization of native land and slavery. Supporters of the theory also believe race is not biological, but culturally invented.
Kimberlé Crenshaw is the head of the African American Policy Forum and one of the earliest supporters of CRT. At first the theory was “simply about telling a more complete story of who we are.”
Is critical race theory being taught In schools?
There is little evidence that critical race theory is being taught to public school students. But some ideas relating to the theory are being taught.
Tassie Zahner is an Advanced Placement, or AP, American history teacher in Montgomery County, Maryland. AP is a nationwide program that provides high school students with college-level classes. She said it would be very hard to teach her class without using some CRT concepts, like America’s history of racism.
“In order to teach an AP U.S. history class correctly you have to talk about those things,” she said. “You can’t prepare students … if you’re not teaching the truth about U.S. history.”
But some parents and conservative lawmakers see some uses of the theory as problematic.
In Greenwich, Connecticut, some middle school students were given a “white  bias  ”  survey  , which angered some parents. The Wake County Public School System in North Carolina organized a meeting for teachers on critical race theory, angering state Republican lawmakers.
Lisa Luten is a spokeswoman for the Wake County school system. North Carolina is one of the 26 states that have proposed laws that restrict critical race theory or limit how teachers can discuss racism or sexism, says the publication  Education Week  .
“Critical race theory is not something we teach to students,” Luten said. “It’s more of a theory in academia about race that adults use to discuss … their environment.”
Why are Republicans upset?
Many conservatives and Republicans say CRT is an effort to rewrite American history. They argue CRT tells white people that they are naturally racist and should feel guilty because of their  privileges  .
But the term “critical race theory” has recently been used as a general description for racial ideas that conservatives dislike. These include white privilege, systemic inequality and  inherent  bias.
How are states addressing it?
Out of the 26 states that have considered legislation, eight have banned or limited the teaching of CRT and similar ideas. The bans, all from Republican-led states, largely describe what can be taught inside the classroom. While legislation in some states mentions critical race theory by name, others do not. Many are unclear about what should or should not be taught.
Other states have banned teaching  The New York Times’  The 1619 Project. Released in 2019, The 1619 Project aimed to tell a story of American history with slavery at the center of the country’s founding.
The banning of CRT ideas has extended to other countries as well. In late June, Australia’s senate voted to remove CRT from the national school system.  The Conversation  reported  that some politicians and media groups were concerned that Australia’s schools were teaching too much about the “oppression, discrimination and struggles of  Indigenous  Australians.”
What is the response to the Republican actions?
Teachers’ groups, educators and social studies organizations worry the laws will make students get an untrue picture of American history. They say it is very damaging for students to think that racism, discrimination and past injustices do not affect the country today.
Education Week  argues  it will be difficult to enforce laws that place limits on what happens inside individual classrooms. But some educators fear that the laws could scare teachers into changing what and how they teach about race.
Zahner said lawmakers and adults pass these kinds of laws because they “  underestimate  the ability of young people to think critically.” She said students do not need to depend on the analysis of historians and social scientists to get an understanding. Often, they can read documents or other information from the past and learn for themselves.
Zahner added that refusing to permit children to study CRT means “you’re taking away both the knowledge and their ability to analyze things.”

50,217468,@nytimes,2016-09-01,"We had a shorter holiday week on The Daily, but we covered a lot of ground, traveling from Afghanistan to Haiti. Along the way, many of you wrote in to share your thoughts and feelings about our episode on critical race theory.
Its a complicated subject with a lot of history and nuance to unpack, and some of you were interested in learning more. So we reached out to Trip Gabriel, a national correspondent and our guest, to answer some of your questions.
What is critical race theory (C.R.T.)?
Critical race theory is a concept, once the domain of graduate schools, that some observers say is now influencing American K-12 curriculums. The theory argues that historical patterns of racism are ingrained in law and other modern institutions, and that the legacies of slavery, segregation and Jim Crow still create an uneven playing field for Black people and other people of color. The idea is that racism is not a matter of individual bigotry but is systemic in America. Recently critics have made C.R.T. a catchall target for opposition to equity efforts, affirmative action and wokeness in general.
Conservatives object that critical race theory is a gauntlet thrown down to accuse all white Americans of being racist, of dividing people by race into oppressors and oppressed. Democrats are conflicted. Some worry that arguing that America is racist to the root a view that is conventional wisdom among elements of the partys progressive wing contradicts the opinion of most Americans and is handing Republicans a political cudgel for the 2022 midterm elections.
Do you have any examples of how C.R.T. is being taught in schools?
Youd have to look long and hard to find any K-12 classroom where the term critical race theory comes up. Instead, what critics tend to target is the influence of concepts derived from C.R.T. that infuse the equity training field (some examples include acknowledging and subverting white privilege, or labeling people as oppressors or oppressed based on identity). This kind of training has been offered by various school districts to teachers in the name of combating implicit bias.
While the anti-C.R.T. activist Christoper F. Rufo lists 11 examples of critical race theory in education, most are examples of schools offering teachers diversity training. He also cites a lesson planned for third graders in Cupertino, Calif., in which students were asked to draw an identity map listing their race, class and gender, and the teacher was asked to identify some characteristics as part of the dominant culture. But according to The Washington Post, the lesson was canceled after one use when parents complained.
Meanwhile, some schools have recommended to young readers the book Not My Idea: A Book About Whiteness, which, in discussing the police shooting of a person of color, makes the point that white supremacy is embedded in American society.
- - New Drug Approved: The F.D.A. approved the first new Alzheimers treatment in 18 years, and the first to attack the disease process.
- Does New Drug Work?: Patient groups are desperate for new options, while several prominent Alzheimers experts and the F.D.A.s own independent advisory committee objected to its approval, having raised concerns over lack of sufficient evidence of its effectiveness.
- Understand Alzheimers Disease: Get answers to common questions about the disease, which affects about 30 million people globally.
- One Face of Alzheimers: This profile of a woman in the early stages of the disease shows what it can be like to face the beginning symptoms and to consider the future.

The show covered criticisms of C.R.T. from the right. Is there criticism of the theory from the left?
Some classical liberals have argued that critical race theory rejects concepts like meritocracy, individualism and unbridled free speech, which it deems products of a white dominant culture. Taking a different angle, John McWhorter, an author who teaches at Columbia University, argues that C.R.T. as interpreted by the anti-racism training field diminishes Black people in the name of dignifying us.
What should listeners read if they want to learn more about C.R.T.?
A seminal book by some of the founding scholars of the academic movement is Words That Wound (1993). The introductory chapters of Critical Race Theory: An Introduction (2001) lay out the movements genesis and principal views.
In recent months, there have been good explainers in the press about how Americas reckoning over systemic racism in policing brought new prominence to critical race theory and provoked a backlash. I found this piece by Fabiola Cineas in Vox helpful, along with this column by Michelle Goldberg of The Times. A deep dive into the related topic of anti-bias training inspired partly by C.R.T. can be found in a Times Magazine profile of Robin DiAngelo, author of White Fragility, by Daniel Bergner. Adam Harris in The Atlantic took a look at bills in state legislatures seeking to ban divisive concepts in education and elsewhere. And Wikipedia (insert usual caveats) has a quite comprehensive look.

Pam Belluck, a health and science writer, reflects on her recent reporting on Aduhelm, a controversial new Alzheimers drug, through one familys experience with it:
By the time I had interviewed Debby Rosenkrantz and Susan Woskie for The Daily, I had been covering Alzheimers and dementia for more than a decade.
Ive traveled to Colombia to report about the worlds largest family with genetic early-onset Alzheimers; went to South Korea to write about children being trained to assist people with dementia; and spent time in a California mens prison to observe how convicted murderers were helping fellow prisoners with dementia with activities like showering, shaving and eating. Ive written about how dementia might affect the ability to give sexual consent. And this past year Ive written about Covid and dementia.
Ive become well aware of the complexities and cruelties of this condition, and Ive followed the roller-coaster ride of the search for answers from discoveries of a gene mutation that might protect against Alzheimers to out-of-the-box therapeutic approaches like using flickering light and sound.
As Ive been talking with patients and family members for my recent reporting on the new drug, Aduhelm, what has struck me most is how thoughtful and insightful theyve been about the difficult situation they find themselves in. Several people Ive interviewed are clear-eyed and candid about their poignant reality, including Debby and her wife, Susan.
The couple knows that so far Debby, who participated in the clinical trial of Aduhelm and began receiving monthly infusions of it again about 10 months ago, has experienced no discernible benefit from the drug. It just feels like theres a blank in places where there shouldnt be a blank in my brain, Debby told me.
They understand the drug can cause brain swelling or brain bleeding, and Debby undergoes regular brain scans to check for such effects. And Susan, a retired professor of public health, told me before the F.D.A. decision that the data about the drug was squishy stuff and that if the F.D.A. decided not to approve it, that wouldnt surprise me, and it might make sense.
And yet they have decided to continue giving the drug a try. They are doing so because they realize there is nothing else out there for them yet. Maybe doing something, whether its taking an unproven drug or exercising or changing ones diet, can give some people a sense of hope that might be therapeutic in itself. In a devastating, unpredictable disease that little by little steals away part of ones mind, hope may actually be the best medicine available right now.

The murder of George Floyd and other high-profile killings of Black people last summer prompted a surge of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to provide more education about racism and its harmful effects. Many of these efforts have been linked to the academic concept called critical race theory, which posits that racism is not simply acts of individual bias or prejudice, but rather is embedded in institutions, policies and legal systems.
Not surprisingly, critical race theory has become a target of America’s ongoing culture wars. Recently, Texas became the fifth state to pass a critical race theory bill, House Bill 3979, which states that “a teacher may not be compelled to discuss a particular event or widely debated currently controversial issue of public policy or social affairs.” If teachers choose to teach this type of material, they must “to the best of the teacher’s ability, strive to explore the topic from diverse and contending perspectives without giving deference to any one perspective.” More than a dozen other states are also considering critical race theory bills.
Negative reactions to critical race theory have reached a fever pitch, with news stories depicting emotional parents at heated forums decrying what they believe to be the ills of critical race theory. There is now an energized conservative movement fueled by activists and politicians who claim critical race theory is divisive, hostile and anti-American, obsessed with race and “hateful lies,” and teaches kids to hate each other.
Critical race theory is not hostile, divisive or anti-American. This characterization is a politicized misrepresentation of the theory that prevents and penalizes any discussion of the idea that systemic racism is, unfortunately, still very much present in American society.
Critics of critical race theory use it as an umbrella term to describe any examination of current systemic racism. It doesn’t matter if schools actually teach critical race theory. In some instances, accusations of teaching critical race theory are simply teachers teaching about racism. While I have never explicitly taught critical race theory, I do teach about how the systemic racism of American society and the perpetuation of anti-Black messages were factors that led to the creation of the Association of Black Psychologists. I provide students examples of how messages of Black deficiency, pathology and inferiority are embedded in school practices (e.g., disproportionately criminalizing the behavior of Black boys and girls).
It appears that the ultimate goal of anti-critical race theory efforts is to prevent any discussion about racism that presents America as less than perfect. Perhaps people need to be reminded that the first 15 words of the Preamble – “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union” – suggests that the Founding Fathers understood that America was a work in progress. Critical race theory reminds us that on matters of race, America remains far from perfect and still a work in progress.
There is nothing insidious or anti-American about acknowledging this fact. One can love America and simultaneously be critical of the ways that structural racism has perpetuated racial inequities such as in health care, a fact acknowledged in a recent article by the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.
Law professor Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined the term “critical race theory,” has suggested that a lot of what is being called critical race theory in the media are ideas that no proponent would agree with.
For example, a critical race theory bill introduced in West Virginia forbids teachers from teaching “divisive concepts” such as teaching that “one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex” and “an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex.”
However, there is nothing in critical race theory that advocates these beliefs.
As a professor of psychology and Black Studies for over two decades, the acknowledgement of historic and current systemic racism has long been an important focus of my teaching. For those who believe that teaching critical race theory or teaching about systemic racism is “hostile, divisive, race-obsessed, and anti-American,” I would beg to differ.
I have taught a lot about issues related to race and systemic racism, and been rewarded for my teaching excellence by being inducted into both the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Texas System Academy of Distinguished Teachers. I have taught students from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, including many white students. I have taught students with diverse political viewpoints, and I have taught students who have not always agreed with me. In all instances, I challenge my students, but also allow myself to be challenged.
I have never taught that one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex, and I have never taught that an individual should be discriminated against because of their race or sex. I have never placed racial guilt on students by separating them between oppressor and oppressed, as alleged in a recent email I received imploring me to defeat critical race theory in my state.
That’s not to say that there aren’t some critical race theory proponents whose approaches to teaching critical race theory may be heavy-handed. In such cases, critics should separate critical race theory T from the messenger. Critics should also acknowledge the intellectual diversity. For example, while some critical race theorists believe racial discrimination is a permanent condition, others have more hope.
The fact of the matter is that critical race theory promotes difficult – but much needed – discussions about race and systemic racism in this country. As the national debate about critical race theory continues, I hope that people will take the time to educate themselves about what is fact vs. what is fiction.

52,217470,The Mercury News,2016-09-01,"Three words sweeping through the U.S. political scene this year — critical race theory — are a decades-old concept.
Conservatives would have you believe it’s taught widely, but critical race theory is typically limited to university classrooms. Even so, GOP governors in  Iowa  and  Texas  have banned the topic from K-12 schools and other Republican-run states are trying to follow suit.
What is critical race theory? Here’s a short explainer.

CRITICAL RACE THEORY DEFINED
Critical race theory suggests that racism and other prejudices are social constructs embedded in legal systems and laws, not the product of individual biases,  according to Education Week  .
Think of the theory as a “remix” of the civil rights movement, Reiland Rabaka tells his students at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The professor of African, African American and Caribbean studies said the theory suggests that American culture, religion and institutions are inextricably linked with race, gender, sexuality and physical ability.
But it’s more than that: Critical race theory says institutions like the criminal justice or education systems have systemic failures — like the  intentional segregation, or “redlining  ,” of neighborhoods across the country — built into the way those things work, according to Debora Ortega, a professor of social work at the University of Denver.
Those failures or acts of discrimination might be attributed to a single racist or a misogynistic administrator or worker, but critical race theory asserts there is a broader and more complicated reason for them.

A SHORT HISTORY
Critical race history first arose in the 1970s and its roots go back even further, Ortega said. Portions come from the Frankfurt School’s critical theory, which was developed by Jewish academics in Germany during the rise of Nazism in the 1930s. Critical theory suggests political or societal institutions create and sustain problems like poverty or hunger.
But other aspects of critical race theory come from writer and sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois, who understood the importance of creating institutions like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to help marginalized people, Rabaka said.
There’s also Black academic Kimberlé Crenshaw, whose concept of  intersectionality  when applied to critical race theory purports that not only do certain races face discrimination but so too do other genders, sexual orientations and physical abilities.
“Everyone hears ‘race’ but part of the theory is also what does it mean to be Black, a woman, disabled,” Ortega said.
Simply put, Rabaka teaches, critical race theory is a way to think of other people as humans and acknowledge that each of them comes from a diverse background and with a distinct set of challenges.
Ortega, who is also director of DU’s Latinx Center, pointed to American schools and history taught within; it’s often whitewashed or reflects favorably — and sometimes inaccurately — on white people, particularly white men.
“For how many years did we say Columbus discovered America as though there was nothing here but squirrels before?” Ortega asked.
Rabaka suggested a comparison between how Black communities struggling with crack cocaine are treated compared to white communities with skyrocketing use of methamphetamine.
“We get incarceration, they get rehabilitation,” Rabaka said.
Both outcomes are the product of the systems from which they come, rather than the prejudices of any single person, they said.
Schools across the U.S. rarely require teachers to teach critical race theory, according to a new survey of 1,136 teachers by t  he Association of American Educators  between June 24 and June 30 (most respondents were public school and charter teachers).
-  4.1% said they were required to teach critical race theory.
-  81% said curriculums should include stories from a diverse set of backgrounds, narratives and cultures.
-  44.7% said they were in favor of critical race theory as an option for educators.
-  11% said the theory should be required curriculum."
53,217471,Fox News,2016-09-01,"Video CNN was accused of ""gaslighting"" and portraying critics of  critical race theory  as ""idiots"" after airing a report that suggested concerned parents don't understand the contentious theory that has swept  the nation  in recent months.
""Everything wrong w/ the modern media: Rather than interviewing subjects of a story & reporting their comments, the reporter starts w/ her own preconceived notion — these parents are idiots — cherrypicks a few for mocking, then shapes her report around advancing her own narrative,"" Grabien Media founder Tom Elliott observed.
WHAT IS CRITICAL RACE THEORY?
CNN ran a long segment on Wednesday's ""New Day"" that mocked parents protesting critical race theory, and co-host Brianna Keilar introduced reporter Elle Reeve by asking, ""Do these vocal opponents of critical race theory actually understand fully what it is?""
""No,"" Reeve said. ""Why should they? It’s an academic theory mostly taught at the grad-student level.""
The CNN reporter then claimed CRT critics ""think it means"" that White students will be taught that ""all White people are bad and racist,"" before the liberal network cut to footage of critical race theory opponents protesting at a school board meeting.
CNN’s Reeve, who previously worked at the left-wing outlet Vice News, enlisted a high school history teacher to echo liberal talking points.
LARGEST TEACHERS UNION SAYS CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS 'REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE' FOR KIDS
""Critical race theory is not being taught in schools,"" teacher Keziah Ridgeway told CNN.
""Can it influence the way that some teachers teach? Yeah,"" Ridgeway said. ""But that’s a good thing, right? Because race and racism is literally the building block of this country.""
Video Earlier this week, the National Education Association, the country’s largest teachers union, voted to promote critical race theory, arguing it is ""reasonable and appropriate"" to use CRT in social studies classes. The move undermined a left-wing talking point that critical race theory is  not being taught  to children.
Reeve then claimed during the CNN segment that ""critical race theory is an academic framework that says racial inequality is perpetuated by the racism embedded in America’s laws, not by individual bigotry"" and told viewers that ""relentless propaganda"" from conservatives has created a panic that White people are under attack.
The high school teacher then admitted she’s teaching children to ""question America.""
The CNN segment pivoted to concerned parents who object to CRT and featured video of the reporter bickering with an anti-CRT activist. Reeve peppered CRT opponents with questions about scholars and specific theories while asking the pro-CRT teacher questions like, ""Are you teaching White kids to hate themselves for being White?""
Keilar fawned over the ""fascinating report"" as the CNN on-screen chyron said, ""CNN asks both sides of debate to define ‘critical race theory.'"" The critics quoted in the segment were largely college Republicans who Reeve found at a Baltimore diner.
TUCKER CARLSON: IF YOU QUESTION CRITICAL RACE THEORY, CRAZED IDEOLOGUES WILL ATTACK YOU AND HURT YOUR CHILDREN
CNN also published  a lengthy online version  on its website headlined, ""The critical race theory panic has White people afraid that they might be complicit in racism,"" which elaborates on many of the points pushed on air.
Many took to Twitter to criticize CNN’s report.
""Parents: I encourage you to listen to what your intellectual and moral betters think of your small-minded, silly concerns, and remember that the candidates with a (D) next to their name when you go to the polls next year feel this way, too,"" journalist Drew Holden  wrote to caption video  of the segment.
""It's a sloppy report and  @elspethreeve  asked classic strawman questions. The issue is not about ‘teaching white kids to hate themselves for being white,’"" Washington Examiner magazine managing editor Jay Caruso wrote.
Republican strategist Matt Whitlock  responded  to the segment, ""Amazing to use this level of cherry picking and straw-manning to make an argument then argue that the OTHER SIDE is pushing propaganda.""
""It’s pretty incredible to see so many in media refuse to cover the woke education debate with even a modicum of good faith and good journalism,"" Whitlock  added  .

54,217472,The Washington Times,2016-09-01,"The fight over critical race theory in the classroom crept into Virginia’s gubernatorial race, where the candidates are banking on education issues to give them the edge in a tight contest.
GOP  nominee  Glenn Youngkin  , 54, is putting  his  focus on the culture wars raging over the race-focused instruction that has spread through K-12 schools in Virginia and across the country.
He  chose to roll out  his  education agenda in Loudoun County, where parents are battling the school board over critical race theory in the curriculum.
Mr.  Youngkin  vowed one of  his  first official acts as governor would be to sign an executive order banning the teachings in Virginia public schools.
Critical race theory, an academic thesis born in the 1970s that grew into an educational trend, teaches that U.S. laws and institutions are inherently racist and cause White people to continue to oppress Black people.
“Critical race theory is not an academic curriculum,” Mr.  Youngkin  said  recently on Fox News. “It is not about telling the truth. It is not about teaching fact-based history. It is, in fact, an entire attempt to divide our kids, and I will not allow it in Virginia.”
Terry McAuliffe, 64, the Democratic nominee, is campaigning on a promise to make an “unprecedented investment” in Virginia schools with a $2 billion boost per year to the education budget.
Mr. McAuliffe prefers not to talk about critical race theory, which garners some support on the left but draws strong opposition from conservatives.
When pressed on the issue, Mr. McAuliffe dismissed critical race theory as a “right-wing conspiracy” made up by his opponent and former President Donald Trump.
“It’s a conspiracy theory,” Mr. McAuliffe recently  told  a reporter. “You know what people want to know about? Why are we not paying our teachers? Why are we down to a thousand teachers today? Why? And why are 50% of our schools 50 years old? This is what people want to know about.”
Mr. McAuliffe, who served as the state’s governor from 2014 to 2018, has pledged to “build a strong post-COVID economy” by increasing teacher salaries, expanding broadband, and pre-school access, as well as addressing racial inequities in schools in an extensive  plan  to modernize Virginia schools.
Richard Meagher, a political science professor at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia, said Mr. Youngkin’s success rate on talking points related to critical race theory will help inform how Republicans campaign in next year’s midterm elections.
“The  Republican Party  is kind of using the governor’s race as well as some other issues across the country to try to test the market and use this idea of critical race theory,” Mr. Meagher said in an interview. “So, I do think that the Youngkin campaign wants to kind of put front and center education issues, and particularly the role of race in education.”
A June  poll  by Morning Consult found that Republican voters generally held negative views of critical race theory.
The poll found that 30% of  GOP  voters had seen, read or heard of critical race theory compared to 21% of Democrats. Among the group, 48% of Republicans said they viewed the idea negatively, and 42% said they did so strongly.
The polls surveyed roughly 2,000 registered voters from June 18-20, with margins of error of plus or minus 3 to 4 percentage points.
In Loudoun County, despite emerging as a national hotbed of parental activism against critical race theory, school officials insist the theory isn’t part of the curricula.
School officials dismissed claims to the contrary as “social media rumors.”
However, Mr. Meagher said that playing up the fear of a creeping agenda may give Mr.  Youngkin  an advantage if  he  can invoke enough emotion from voters.
“If you get enough people upset, you can win elections,” Mr. Meagher said.
“The question is, how many people can you get upset in a blue state like Virginia, which has just really become solidly blue demographically voter-wise? Can you rile up enough of these kinds of suburban voters to win back the suburbs? That’s the question for the Republicans, and Loudoun is a good sort of signpost for them.”
J. Miles Coleman, of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, said he thinks it’s strategically wise for Mr. McAuliffe not to speak out too much on Mr.  Youngkin  ’s invocation of critical race theory and other cultural issues.
“I think that if you acknowledge it and try to kind of level with  his  critics on it, I don’t think a lot of  his  Democratic base voters would really like that,” Mr. Coleman said in an interview. “If I were him, I would just sidestep that issue and keep talking, OK well, here’s what I want to do for the rural areas or to help broadband. I think the best strategy is just to kind of deal with his own plan.”
Mr. Youngkin’s campaign disputed that their candidate has focused solely on combating critical race theory in his education plan, adding other elements he’s advocating for such as raising academic standards, narrowing the literacy gap, and offering more advanced course options.
A Youngkin campaign official told The Washington Times that critical race theory is a portion of the Youngkin education plan but not the whole thing.
“We’re seeking to achieve the best curriculum without a political agenda involved in it,” the official said.
Alleigh Marre, president of the newly formed Free to Learn Coalition, a nonpartisan organization working to remove political agendas in schools, said the coronavirus pandemic heightened the interest Virginia parents have had in education.
In addition to what’s being taught in schools, Ms. Marre said closing the academic gap remains critical to the future of the state’s education, which she sees as a priority for both Republicans and Democrats.
“We certainly plan to continue to raise awareness about public education in the state of Virginia as a whole, and where we see there are needs that are unmet,” Ms. Marre said in an interview. “And so I would certainly hope that it is, and maintains a priority status for both candidates.”

55,217473,nypost.com,2016-09-01,"CRITICAL RACE THEORY
The latest defense for teaching our children to be racially divisive? It’s free speech!
Last week,  The New York Times published an opinion piece  by commentators David French, Kmele Foster, Thomas Chatterton Williams and Jason Stanley, who presented themselves as a heroic “cross-partisan group of thinkers.”
They derided as “un-American” laws passed by states such as Texas, Florida, Idaho, Oklahoma, Arkansas and New Hampshire that prohibit public schools from promoting the core principles of critical race theory, including race essentialism, collective guilt and state-sanctioned discrimination.
These authors imagine themselves the steady hand in a grandiose morality play, defending liberal-democratic freedoms against the threat of illiberalism, wherever it comes from.
But in practice, they are enablers of the worst ideologies of the Left and would leave American families defenseless against them. Their three core arguments — that critical race theory restrictions violate “free speech,” that state legislatures should stay out of the “marketplace of ideas,” and that citizens should pursue civil-rights litigation instead — are all hollow to the core.
In reality, they would usher in the concrete tyrannies of  critical race theory  , which explicitly seeks to subvert the principles of individual rights and equal protection under the law. Despite the superficial ideological differences between the four authors, they serve a single function: to prevaricate, stall and run interference for critical race theory’s blitz through American institutions.
The authors’ primary error is framing the debate as a question about free speech. This is bizarre. The First Amendment was designed to protect citizens from the government, not to protect the government from citizens.

Public schools, which have the power of compulsion, are pushing toxic racial theories onto children, teaching them that they should be judged on the basis of race and must atone for historical crimes committed by members of their racial group.
Critical race theorists, of course, have the  right to express their beliefs  as individuals, but voters and taxpayers are not obligated to subsidize their speech and include it in the public school curriculum.
After all, the public education system is not a “marketplace of ideas”; it is a state-run monopoly with the power of force. Even under the most dogmatic libertarian philosophy, monopoly conditions justify, even require, government intervention.
The anti-critical race theory bills do not restrict teaching and inquiry about the history of racism; they restrict indoctrination, abusive pedagogies and state-sanctioned racism.
In Idaho, for example, the law tells public schools they cannot “compel students to personally affirm, adopt or adhere to” noxious ideas, such as one race “is inherently superior or inferior” or that an individual “should be adversely treated on the basis of race.”
The Times op-ed authors, however, make the case that the public must not interfere directly in public institutions, even those that promote state-sanctioned racism. They argue that anti-critical race theory legislation constitutes a “speech code” and that any such limitations on the public school curriculum “threaten” democracy itself.
But isn’t some kind of speech restriction inevitable, even obligatory, in public schools?
Or do state educators have the right to promote any ideology they desire — say, for example, eugenics or gay conversion therapy — immune from legislative restriction?

During a  recent conversation on the Bari Weiss podcast  , I asked co-author David French a simple question to test the implications of his theory: If a public school adopted a Klan-sponsored curriculum that promoted racial superiority theory, would he support or oppose state legislation to ban it?
He ducked the question — and, when confronted on social media, Kmele Foster and Thomas Chatterton Williams also refused to answer. But the application of this principle to school curricula still remains, and there seem to be three possible answers: First, they could support a ban, in which case their disagreement on the critical race theory ban would be partisan, not principled; or second, they could oppose a ban, which would be internally consistent, but atrocious on moral and practical grounds — a state should absolutely prohibit public schools from promoting Klan ideology.
In the Bari Weiss podcast and in the Times op-ed, French and his colleagues appear to take a third position: They claim that many of the practices of critical race theory are already illegal under federal civil-rights law and, therefore, new legislation is unnecessary.
This might be true as a matter of pure legal theory, but in reality, thousands of public schools are already engaging in these abusive practices and most parents do not have the resources to file a federal civil-rights lawsuit at every infraction — and the Biden administration has dropped all enforcement against critical race theory in public education, eliminating another avenue of protection.
The status quo puts an extreme burden on individual families, while shielding public school from democratic oversight and accountability. This position, presented as a principled third way, is an illusion: It might make for a compelling law-review article, but in practice, it will move the country further down the path of racial abuse in the classroom, affording parents no recourse except for the abstract satisfaction that, in the mind of some intellectuals, these practices are already illegal.
The difference between these two approaches — action and nonaction — is significant. With state prohibitions on critical race theory indoctrination, schools have clear guidance about their curricula and families have immediate recourse.
If teachers are pushing divisive racial theories in the classroom, parents can point to a clear, specific legal statute and force the school into compliance; if that fails, they can appeal to state attorneys general or state superintendents, who can immediately enforce the law.
With the French-Foster-Williams-Stanley approach of maintaining the status quo, schools can continue to promote race essentialism, collective guilt and racial superiority theory, and parents would be obligated to file an expensive, multiyear federal lawsuit to challenge these programs in the courts one by one, with no guarantee of success.
In the end, state legislation tilts the playing field in favor of parents; the status quo tilts the playing field in favor of bureaucrats, lawyers, and diversity officers.
Is it possible that these writers simply aren’t aware of the illiberal nature of critical race theory? In a word, no.
David French, in particular, should know better. In 2012, he denounced critical race theory as a dangerous cult that enforced its orthodoxy with “vicious” harassment on the Harvard University campus; in 2017, he described it as “racial poison” that “leads to sheer cruelty and malice.”
In our recent podcast conversation, after I suggested that critical race theory was verging on hegemony within our institutions, he pushed back, arguing that if the critical theorists had truly achieved hegemony, our conversation would not have been possible — it would have been outlawed, censored, banned.
This is telling: French understands intuitively that critical race theory is a totalitarian ideology that, if it were to achieve absolute power, would immediately dismantle the liberal system, beginning with the right to free speech.
But French and his collaborators refuse to make the obvious connection. If critical race theory is “racial poison,” why allow it to seize control of our schools? If critical race theorists are “magnetic, preacher-like personalities” who seek totalitarian power, why defend them in the name of liberalism?
In practice, these writers have turned the Paradox of Tolerance into a farce. They cling to procedural arguments about phantom freedoms, while conceding substantive power to those who explicitly oppose Enlightenment rationalism, equality under the law, and the concept of rights itself.

As a result, they end up enabling the most intolerant voices in our society, who have shown no capacity for self-moderation.
At heart, they mistake protecting the status quo with protecting freedom — a lazy, not principled, position. If their ideas were to prevail, they would end up perverting the very values they claim to cherish: public school teachers forcing first-graders to denounce themselves as racists would become “free speech”; school diversity officers forcing students through race reeducation programs would become “academic freedom.”
And the ratchet only goes one way: They see no problem with states such as California, Oregon, Washington and Illinois mandating critical race theory in their state curricula and teacher-training programs; but if states such as Texas, Oklahoma, Idaho and New Hampshire prohibit it, all of a sudden, that is an “un-American” threat to “the expression of ideas.”
Luckily, the American public has infinitely more sense than the New York Times op-ed page. The revolt against critical race theory has inspired millions of parents to engage in the political process, protest at school board meetings, run for office, file lawsuits, and lobby state legislators to stop the madness through the rightful exercise of democratic power.
According to a recent YouGov/Economist poll  , 64 percent of Americans now know about critical race theory, of which 58 percent view it unfavorably, including 72 percent of independents who believe including it in school curricula is “bad for America.”
These citizens understand implicitly that public schools are being devoured by a hostile ideology that seeks to divide the country by race and undermine the core principle of democratic control. They understand a simple truth, forgotten by the chattering class: In a democracy, voters get to decide how to shape, guide and restrict public institutions, especially those that have power over children.
The war against critical race theory is a war worth fighting — and, more importantly, a war worth winning. Naive libertarianism, as always, is a path to demoralization, empty gestures and, ultimately, defeat.

THE BOOK THAT SHOWS WHAT CRT CRITICS ARE UP AGAINST
More than two dozen public schools and school districts across the country are recommending a book titled  “Not My Idea” by Anastasia Higginbotham  that suggests being white is a deal with the devil.
Manhattan Institute fellow Christopher F. Rufo found that the picture book (below) is being recommended for students as young as preschool age despite including passages such as, “Whiteness is a bad deal. It always was.”
On one page, a red-tailed devil made of money offers a “Contract Binding YOU to WHITENESS.”
“You get: stolen land, stolen, riches, special favors. WHITENESS gets: to mess endlessly with the lives of your friends, neighbors, loved ones, and all fellow humans of COLOR for the purpose of profit.”
The book, also recommended for students age 8 and up at the private Corlears School in Chelsea, presents a mother who “doesn’t see color” as wrong. “Deep down, we all know color matters,” the book reads. “Skin color makes a difference
in how the world sees you and in how you see the world . . . It makes a difference in how much trouble seems to find you or let you be.”
Christopher F. Rufo is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute."
56,217474,capcityfreepress.blogspot.com,2016-09-01,"U.S. Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana sent a letter to fellow Republicans on June 24, 2021, stating: As Republicans, we reject the racial essentialism that critical race theory teaches & that our institutions are racist and need to be destroyed from the ground up.
Kimberl� Crenshaw, a law professor and central figure in the development of critical race theory, said in a recent interview that critical race theory just says, lets pay attention to what has happened in this country, and how what has happened in this country is continuing to create differential outcomes. & Critical Race Theory & is more patriotic than those who are opposed to it because & we believe in the promises of equality. And we know we cant get there if we cant confront and talk honestly about inequality.
Representative Banks account is demonstrably false and typical of many people publicly declaring their opposition to critical race theory. Crenshaws characterization, while true, does not detail its main features. So what is critical race theory and what brought it into existence?
The development of critical race theory by legal scholars such as Derrick Belland Crenshaw was largely a response to the slow legal progress and setbacks faced by African Americans from the end of the Civil War, in 1865, through the end of the civil rights era, in 1968. To understand critical race theory, you need to first understand the history of African American rights in the U.S.
The history
After 304 years of enslavement, then-former slaves gained equal protection under the law with the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868. The 15th Amendment, in 1870, guaranteed voting rights for men regardless of race or previous condition of servitude.
Between 1866 and 1877 the period historians call Radical Reconstruction African Americans began businesses, became involved in local governance and law enforcement, and were elected to Congress.
This early progress was subsequently diminished by state laws throughout the American South called Black Codes, which limited voting rights, property rights, and compensation for work; made it illegal to be unemployed or not have documented proof of employment; and could subject prisoners to work without pay on behalf of the state. These legal rollbacks were worsened by the spread of Jim Crow laws throughout the country requiring segregation in almost all aspects of life.
Grassroots struggles for civil rights were constant in post-Civil War America. Some historians even refer to the period from the New Deal Era, which began in 1933, to the present as The Long Civil Rights Movement.
The period stretching from Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which found school segregation to be unconstitutional, to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibited discrimination in housing, was especially productive.
The civil rights movement used practices such as civil disobedience, nonviolent protest, grassroots organizing, and legal challenges to advance civil rights. The U.S.s need to improve its image abroad during the Cold War importantly aided these advancements. The movement succeeded in banning explicit legal discrimination and segregation, promoted equal access to work and housing, and extended federal protection of voting rights.
However, the movement that produced legal advances had no effect on the increasing racial wealth gap between Blacks and whites, while school and housing segregation persisted.
What critical race theory is
Critical race theory is a field of intellectual inquiry that demonstrates the legal codification of racism in America.
Through the study of law and U.S. history, it attempts to reveal how racial oppression shaped the legal fabric of the U.S. Critical race theory is traditionally less concerned with how racism manifests itself in interactions with individuals and more concerned with how racism has been, and is, codified into the law.
There are a few beliefs commonly held by most critical race theorists.
First, race is not fundamentally or essentially a matter of biology, but rather a social construct. While physical features and geographic origin play a part in making up what we think of as race, societies will often make up the rest of what we think of as race. For instance, 19th- and early-20th-century scientists and politicians frequently described people of color as intellectually or morally inferior, and used those false descriptions to justify oppression and discrimination.
Second, these racial views have been codified into the nations foundational documents and legal system. For evidence of that, look no further than the Three-Fifths Compromise in the Constitution, whereby slaves, denied the right to vote, were nonetheless treated as part of the population for increasing congressional representation of slave-holding states.
Third, given the pervasiveness of racism in our legal system and institutions, racism is not aberrant, but a normal part of life.
Fourth, multiple elements, such as race and gender, can lead to kinds of compounded discrimination that lack the civil rights protections given to individual, protected categories. For example, Crenshaw has forcibly argued that there is a lack of legal protection for Black women as a category. The courts have treated Black women as Black, or women, but not both in discrimination cases despite the fact that they may have experienced discrimination because they were both.
These beliefs are shared by scholars in a variety of fields who explore the role of racism in areas such as education, health care, and history.
Finally, critical race theorists are interested not just in studying the law and systems of racism, but in changing them for the better.
What critical race theory is not
Critical race theory has become a catch-all phrase among legislators attempting to ban a wide array of teaching practices concerning race. State legislators in Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and West Virginia have introduced legislation banning what they believe to be critical race theory from schools.
But what is being banned in education, and what many media outlets and legislators are calling critical race theory, is far from it. Here are sections from identical legislation in Oklahoma and Tennessee that propose to ban the teaching of these concepts. As a philosopher of race and racism, I can safely say that critical race theory does not assert the following:
(1) One race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex;
(2) An individual, by virtue of the individuals race or sex, is inherently privileged, racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or subconsciously;
(3) An individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment because of the individuals race or sex;
(4) An individuals moral character is determined by the individuals race or sex;
(5) An individual, by virtue of the individuals race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex;
(6) An individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or another form of psychological distress solely because of the individuals race or sex.
What most of these bills go on to do is limit the presentation of educational materials that suggest that Americans do not live in a meritocracy, that foundational elements of U.S. laws are racist, and that racism is a perpetual struggle from which America has not escaped.
Americans are used to viewing their history through a triumphalist lens, where we overcome hardships, defeat our British oppressors, and create a country where all are free with equal access to opportunities.
Obviously, not all of that is true.
Critical race theory provides techniques to analyze U.S. history and legal institutions by acknowledging that racial problems do not go away when we leave them unaddressed.

57,217475,Mail Online,2016-09-01,"America's largest teachers' union has announced it backs the teaching of critical race theory in schools, wants to hire staff to 'fight back' against those who oppose CRT, and has called for an October 14 rally to be held in honor of  George Floyd  's birthday.
The National Educator's Association recently approved a  resolution  to promote critical race theory through its existing channels, work to 'fight back' against opponents of the practice.
It also wants to assemble a team to teach it to union members and create a 'national day of action' to start a dialogue about systemic racism on October 14 –  George Floyd  's birthday.
The resolution reads that the NEA will 'provide an already-created, in-depth, study that critiques empire, white supremacy, anti-Blackness, anti-Indigeneity, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism (human centered points of view) and other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society.'
It continues to say that the NEA plans to 'publicly (through existing media) convey its support for the accurate and honest teaching of social studies topics, including truthful and age-appropriate accountings of unpleasant aspects of American history, such as slavery, and the oppression and discrimination of Indigenous, Black, Brown, and other peoples of color, as well as the continued impact this history has on our current society.
'The Association will further convey that in teaching these topics, it is reasonable and appropriate for curriculum to be informed by academic frameworks for understanding and interpreting the impact of the past on current society, including critical race theory.'
President Becky Pringle has also agreed to make public statements in support of critical race theory and 'racial honesty in education'
The National Educator's Association recently approved a resolution to promote critical race theory in schools - and said it wants to hire a team to 'fight back' against those opposed to CRT
As part of the resolution, the NEA, whose Washington DC headquarters is pictured, will assemble a team to teach it to union members
In addition to its plans, the NEA will join with Black Lives Matter at School and the Zinn Education Project to create a 'national day of action' on October 14 – George Floyd's birthday – to have a dialogue on systemic racism
The 1619 Project won the Pulitzer Prize in 2019. It was praised by some as shining a light on untold history, but lambasted by others, including former President Donald Trump, for what he said was a jaundiced view of the US
The resolution promises that the NEA will oppose efforts to ban critical race theory and The 1619 Project, a collection of essays, photo essays, short fiction pieces and poems published by the New York Times Magazine in August 2019 to 'reframe' American history based on the impact of slaves brought to the US.
The project, in the words of the NYT, aims to reframe the country's history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of the national narrative.
A number of historians have knocked the project for putting ideology ahead of historical understanding. And, in April, thirty-seven Republicans led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell demanded that the U.S. Department of Education not teach the 1619 Project because it puts a 'divisive agenda' over accuracy.
Politico Playbook first reported that McConnell penned a letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona on behalf of himself and 37 Senate Republican colleagues asking the nation's education chief not to include The New York Times' controversial project in a curriculum update.
In addition to its plans, the NEA will join with Black Lives Matter at School and the Zinn Education Project to create a 'national day of action' on October 14 – George Floyd's birthday – to have a dialogue on systemic racism. Then, on October 15, it will have another day of action to commemorate Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Philando Castile, Tamir Rice and other black lives taken by police.
The NEA represents 3 million public school employees in all 50 states. The union has a $350 million annual budget, and its members span 14,000 local communities.
Following the NEA's decision, Christopher Rufo, an outspoken opponent of Critical Race Theory, wrote in a tweet, 'BREAKING: The nation's largest teachers union has approved a plan to promote critical race theory in all 50 states and 14,000 local school districts. The argument that 'critical race theory isn't in K-12 schools' is officially dead.'
Rufo continued: 'The union has also approved funding for ""increasing the implementation"" of CRT in K-12 curricula and for attacking conservative groups who oppose CRT indoctrination.
'The teachers union has made critical race theory its #1 priority—and want to implement it nationwide.
'According to a recent YouGov survey, 58 percent of Americans oppose critical race theory, including 72 percent of independents who believe teaching it in schools is ""bad for America.""
'But the teachers union wants to double-down and impose this divisive ideology on your children.
'The NEA represents 3 million public school employees in all 50 states. They have a $350 million annual budget and an army of operatives in 14,000 local communities. They have now declared war on parents who oppose critical race theory—and parents must fight back!'

Parents protested critical race theory in schools at a board of education meeting in Ashburn, Virginia, which is on of 26 states debating a ban on the controversial initiative
Nine states have enacted complete bans on implementing critical race theory in schools
-

As of June 29, 26 states have introduced bills or taken steps to restrict teaching critical race theory or limit how teachers can discuss racism and sexism, according to an Education Week analysis. Nine states have enacted complete bans.
It is unclear how the NEA will carry out its plans in these states or how it will get around such bans on critical race theory.
Some of the steps the NEA will take include conducting a virtual listening tour to educate its members on how to implement critical race theory and other approaches to addressing systemic racism in the classroom.
President Becky Pringle has also agreed to make public statements in support of critical race theory and 'racial honesty in education.'
According to Pringle’s bio on the NEA website, she is a middle school science teacher with 31 years of teaching experience and ‘a fierce social justice warrior, defender of educator rights, an unrelenting advocate for all students and communities of color, and a valued and respected voice in the education arena.’
Before serving as president, Pringle was NEA vice president and secretary-treasurer before that. She directed NEA’s work to combat institutional racism, and spotlight systemic patterns of racism and educational injustice that impact students.
Critical race theory examines how racism pervades all aspects of society, and disadvantages black and brown people. Its supporters say it provides awareness of how insidious racism can be, and how to tackle it.
Opponents of CRT say it is overly divisive, and wrong to teach young children that they are either oppressed or oppressors depending on the color of their skin.
While it's already been approved, the NEA noted that its plans cannot be implemented under its current 2021-2022 budget and would cost an additional $127,600 to carry out."

EPISODE NOTES
Critical race theory was created in the 1970s by a Harvard Professor seeking to describe the way racism is baked into the legal system. Half a century later, CRT is now the weapon of choice for right-wing pundits looking to silence conversations about race.
From an academic discipline to a conservative scare tactic, how did critical race theory become the dominant culture war in American politics? And what does CRT actually stand for?"
59,217477,The Atlantic,2016-09-01,"Pundits and politicians have created their own definition for the term, and then set about attacking it.

The United States is not in the midst of a culture war over race and racism. The animating force of our current conflict is not our differing values, beliefs, moral codes, or practices. The American people arent divided. The American people are being divided.
Republican operatives have buried the actual definition of critical race theory: a way of looking at laws role platforming, facilitating, producing, and even insulating racial inequality in our country, as the law professor Kimberl� Crenshaw, who helped coin the term, recentlydefined it. Instead, the attacks on critical race theory are based on made-up definitions and descriptors. Critical race theory says every white person is a racist, Senator Ted Cruz has said. It basically teaches that certain children are inherently bad people because of the color of their skin, said the Alabama state legislator Chris Pringle.
There arediffering points of view about race and racism. But what we are seeing and hearing on news shows, in school-district meetings, in op-ed pages, in legislative halls, and in social-media feeds arent multiple sides with differing points of view. Theres only one side in our so-called culture war right now.
Conor Friedersdorf: Critical race theory is making both parties flip-flop
The Republican operatives, who dismiss the expositions of critical race theorists and anti-racists in order to define critical race theory and anti-racism, and then attack those definitions, are effectively debating themselves. They have conjured an imagined monster to scare the American people and project themselves as the nations defenders from that fictional monster.
The evangelist Pat Robertson recently called critical race theory a monstrous evil. And over the past year, that monstrous evil has supposedly been growing many legs. First, Republicans pointed to Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Three days after George Floyds murder last year, President Donald Trump recast the largely peaceful demonstrators as violent and dishonorable THUGS. By the end of July, Trump had framed them as anarchists who hate our country.
Then cancel culture was targeted. At the Republican National Convention in August, Trump blasted cancel culture as seeking to coerce Americans into saying what you know to be false and scare you out of saying what you know to be true.
Next came attacks on the 1619 Project and American history. Despite the virtues and accomplishments of this Nation, many students are now taught in school to hate their own country, and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes, but rather villains, read Trumps executive order on November 2, establishing the Presidents Advisory 1776 Commission.
And now the Black Lives Matter demonstrators, cancel culture, the 1619 Project, American history, and anti-racist education are presented to the public as the many legs of the monstrous evil of critical race theory thats purportedly coming to harm white children. The language echoes the rhetoric used to demonize desegregation after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, in 1954.
In the 1950s and 60s, the conservators of racism organized to keep Black kids out of all-white schools. Today, they are trying to get critical race theory out of American schools. Instead of helping young people discover that America is the greatest, most tolerant, and most generous nation in history, [critical race theory] teaches them that America is systemically evil and that the hearts of our people are full of hatred and malice, Trump wrote in an op-ed on June 18.
After it was cited 132 times on Fox News shows in 2020, critical race theory became a conservative obsession this year. Its mentions on Fox News practically doubled month after month: It was referred to 51 times in February, 139 times in March, 314 times in April, 589 times in May, and 737 times in just the first three weeks of June. As of June 29, 26 states had introduced legislation or other state-level actions to restrict teaching critical race theory or limit how teachers can discuss racism and sexism, according to Education Week, and nine had implemented such bans.
I have been called the father of critical race theory, although I was born in 1982, and critical race theory was born in 1981. Over the past few months, I have seldom stopped to answer the critiques of critical race theory or of my own work, because the more Ive studied these critiques, the more Ive concluded that these critics arent arguing against me. They arent arguing against anti-racist thinkers. They arent arguing against critical race theorists. These critics are arguing against themselves.
Read: The GOPs critical race theory obsession
What happens when a politician falsely proclaims what you think, and then criticizes that proclamation? Is she really critiquing your ideasor her own? If a writer decides what both sides of an argument are stating, is he really engaging in an argument with another writer, or is he engaging in an argument with himself?
Take the journalist Matthew Yglesias. In February, in TheWashington Post, he wrote that I think that any racial gap simply is racist by definition; any policy that maintains such a gap is a racist policy; andmost debatablyany intellectual explanation of its existence (sociological, cultural and so on) is also racist. But nowhere have I written that the racial gap is racist: The policies and practices causing the racial gap are racist. Nowhere have I stated that any intellectual explanation of the existence of a racial gap is racist. Only intellectual explanations of a racial gap that point to the superiority or inferiority of a racial group are racist.
Was Yglesias really arguing against me, or was he arguing against himself? What about the columnist Ross Douthat? In a recent op-ed in The New York Times, he did what GOP thinkers keep doing to Americans striving to construct an equitable and just society: re-create us as extremists, as monsters to be feared for speaking out against racism. Douthat accused me of ideological extremism that embarrasses clever liberals, comparing me to the late Rush Limbaugh. Ive spent my career writing evidence-based historical scholarship and demonstrating my willingness to be vulnerable; Limbaugh had no interest in being self-critical, and for decades attacked truth and facts and evidence.
Douthat claimed that I have a Manichaean vision of public policy, in which all policymaking is either racist or antiracist, all racial disparities are the result of racismand the measurement of any outcome short of perfect equity may be a form of structural racism itself.
Where did he get perfect equity? In How to Be an Antiracist, I define racial equity as a state when two or more racial groups are standing on a relatively equal footing. I proposed that an example of racial equity would be if there were relatively equitable percentages of racial groups living in owner-occupied homes in the forties, seventies, or, better, nineties. By contrast, in 2014, 71 percent of white families lived in owner-occupied homes, compared with 45 percent of Latino families and 41 percent of Black families. Thats racial inequity.
What we write doesnt matter to the people arguing with themselves. It doesnt matter that I consistently challenge Manichaean racial visions of inherently good or evil people or policy making. It doesnt matter that I dont write about policy making being good or evil, or that I write about the equitable or inequitable outcome of policies. It doesnt matter that Ive urged us toward relative equity, and not toward perfect equity.
If you want to understand why Ive made these arguments, you first need to recognize that for decades, right-wing thinkers and judges have argued that policies that lead to racial inequities are not racist or are race neutral. That was the position of the conservative Supreme Court justices who recently upheld Arizonas voting-restriction policies. Those who wish to conserve racial inequity want us to focus on intentwhich is hard to proverather than the outcome of inequity, which is rather easy to prove. Case in point: GOP state legislators are claiming that the 28 laws theyve enacted in 17 states as of June 21 are about election security, even though voter fraud is a practically nonexistent problem. They claim that these laws arent intended to make it harder for Black voters or members of other minority groups to cast ballots, even as experts find thats precisely what such laws have done in the past, and predict thats likely what these new laws will do as well.
Jarvis R. Givens: Whats missing from the discourse about anti-racist teaching
These critics arent just making up their claims as they go along. They are making up the sources of their criticism as they go along. Douthat argues that work like mine extends structural analysis beyond what it can reasonably bear, into territory where white supremacy supposedly explains Asian American success on the SAT. Who is giving this explanation other than Douthat? Im surely not. I point to other explanations, including the history of highly educated Asian immigrants and the concentration of score-boosting test-prep companies in Asian (and white) neighborhoods.
White supremacy does explain why more than three-quarters of the perpetrators of anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents before and during the pandemic have been white. Asian American success as measured by test scores, education, and income should not erase the impact of structural racism on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. This group now has the highest income inequality of any racial group in the United States. Asian Americans in New York experienced the highest surge of unemployment of any racial group during the pandemic. Do the critics of critical race theory want us to think of the AAPI community as not just a model minority, but a model monolith? Showcasing AAPIs to maintain the fiction of a postracial society ends up erasing Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Critical race theory has been falsely labeled as anti-Asian. Helen Raleigh, an Asian American entrepreneur, defined critical race theory as a divisive discriminatory ideology that judges people on the basis of their skin color in Newsweek. It is my practice to ignore critics who have not read the work and who are not interested in honest exchange, responded one of the three Asian American founders of critical race theory, Mari Matsuda, a law professor at the University of Hawaii. But I do want to say this for the record: Asian Americans are at the center of CRT analysis and have been from the start.
How should thinkers respond to monstrous lies? Should we mostly ignore the critics as Matsuda has, as I have? Because restating facts over and over again gets old. Reciting your own work over and over again to critics who either havent read what they are criticizing or are purposefully distorting it gets old. And talking with people who have created a monologue with two points of view, theirs and what they impute to you, gets old.
But democracy needs dialogue. And dialogue necessitates seeking to know what a person is saying in order to offer informed critiques.
As a scholar, I know that nothing is more useful than criticism to improve my scholarship. As a human being, I know that nothing is more constructive than criticism to improve my humanity. Ive chronicled how criticism and critics have been a driving force on my journey to be anti-racist, to confront my own racist, sexist, homophobic, and classist ideasand their intersections. Constructive criticism often hurts, but like painful medical treatments, it can be lifesaving; it can be nation-saving.
But whats happening now is something entirely different and destructivenot constructive. This isnt a culture war. This isnt even an argument. This isnt even criticism. This is critics arguing with themselves."

To understand what’s happening right now with critical race theory, it helps to go back to when the idea was first germinated in the 1970s. During that time, Derrick Bell, who’d become the first tenured Black professor at Harvard Law School, was researching racism wasn’t just about individual choices, but structural—baked into systems, legal and otherwise, that people come up against in their lives. Bell’s ideas gained purchase among other Ivy League scholars, including Kimberlé Crenshaw, who helped organized a 1989 conference called “New Developments in Critical Race Theory,” effectively giving this new field a name. Bell and his compatriots tried all kinds of ways to impart his big idea—that American law is imbued with racial bigotry—to the broadest possible audience, from sci-fi stories to discursive books that were recommended in universities. But in recent times, the theory behind these stories has been  infamously squashed and twisted by Republicans and conservative pundits  . After decades of use within academia, how did critical race theory become so controversial, so quickly? To find out, I spoke with Adam Harris, a staff writer at the Atlantic who was introduced to critical race theory during college, on  Tuesday’s episode of What Next  . Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Adam Harris:  As a framework for understanding, race in American law, critical race theory has been, for academics, a very useful tool. But the problem is that, as with other academic frameworks and theories, it gets distorted when it leaves academia.
Mary Harris: I was surprised by how long these three words—  critical race theory  —had been used as a conservative boogeyman. Never been as much as now, but it’s come up before. Like Lani Guinier, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton to be an assistant attorney general, her nomination was scuttled partially because of discussion about critical race theory. Can you talk about  when  these three words were seized on in order to criticize people, especially Democrats?

Lani Guinier’s nomination was  one of the first times you really saw the theory show up in a major way  —when Democrats backed away, they were all effectively saying she was too radical and CRT too divisive of a concept. But then it kind of went dormant in the broader conversation. You saw a mention of it when Derrick Bell died in 2011 and a video resurfaced of  President Barack Obama introducing Bell when Obama was a student in the 1990s  . Conservatives said this was evidence the president was consorting with radicals. And that was the first mention of CRT on Fox News. The second instance is a throwaway mention after George Zimmerman acquitted for the murder of Trayvon Martin. Then you don’t really hear about it much. There are about four or five mentions in between Zimmerman’s acquittal and June 2020, right after George Floyd is murdered by Derek Chauvin. Then people take to the streets, and you start to see a pushback to this fundamental reassessment of the gaps and inequities in American society.

Over the past year, one person in particular has been leading the charge against critical race theory: Christopher Rufo. He lives in Seattle and works for a conservative think tank. As protests were sweeping the country last summer, he got an email from a city of Seattle employee. It said required diversity training was teaching employees to hate their country – and it included PowerPoint slides as proof. Rufo saw this as an opportunity, and he started writing about it.
He doesn’t use the term  critical race theory  at first. But he starts to get messages from other school districts, various anecdotes from the federal government, and he writes each of these up and into a small portfolio of stories. Then he’s invited by September on Tucker Carlson’s show. Rufo starts off by saying that critical race theory is infecting the upper echelons of American bureaucracy, that it’s become the dominant theory of diversity trainings, and that it should be banned because it is teaching white people to hate themselves—that it’s teaching Americans to hate America fundamentally, things that are contrary to what critical race theory actually does. Rufo then calls on President Donald Trump to ban critical race theory and federal workforce trainings. He receives a message the next day from the president’s chief of staff. The president had apparently been watching the program. And three weeks later, the president signs an executive order banning the fun house mirror version of critical race theory that Rufo had outlined on Fox News.

Rufo seems to know exactly what he’s doing: There’s a name, CRT, that he can hang a whole bunch of feelings on. He’s not subtle about it. He says he wants everyone to associate any negative feelings they have about race and about being forced to talk of race with this phrase.
You know, I asked him to define what critical race theory was at that time.  He defined the theory in a way that many critical races theorists actually would not disagree with  . But outside of the definition of the theory, he said that effectively he wants to wrap all of the things that, you conservatives disagree with under this veil of “critical race theory” so that it’s fundamentally changed the public’s understanding of what the term actually means.

It’s important to say flat out that what conservatives are mad about right now is not necessarily critical race theory itself—that’s the brand name they’ve assigned to a bigger fight over how Americans talk about race. But that hasn’t stopped Republicans in statehouses around the country from rushing to legislate away any mention of critical race theory in school curriculums or government trainings. Sometimes the language is much broader than that, simply looking to quash “  divisive concepts  ” in the classroom. So far, legislation about critical race theory or related ideas has been  introduced in 22 states, and signed into law in six of them  . The language, mechanisms, and consequences are different between each bill, but the overall effect is mostly the same.

What free speech advocates were worried about at the beginning was that such bills would effectively chill speech, chill what teachers and professors felt comfortable being able to say.
You’ve written that the vagueness is part of the point: If you’re so vague anything can go in there.
That is effectively the point of the way that the bills are written. Some of these “divisive concepts” are written in a way that it’s like, if I teach my students about exclusionary zoning laws, is that how you understand a “divisive concept”?
One person’s “divisive concept” is another person’s truth and history.
Exactly. Teachers are just teaching history and facts. It is true that redlining continues to affect housing segregation in cities today. That’s not a belief. That is a fact.

The most chilling rule to me was  one in Florida requiring folks at public universities to be surveyed  to ensure that there was “intellectual diversity.” There’s no indication of how the surveys will be used. It’s just a vague, clouded threat.
I also keep coming back to the Pennsylvania legislation that says certain books can’t be taught, that certain speakers, can’t come to campuses. It’s been interesting because over the past several years, that has been a prominent conservative criticism, that they’re shutting down conservative speakers, and now you have conservative lawmakers introducing bills that would ban speakers from coming to campus, that would ban teachers from assigning certain texts. That’s a textbook free speech violation.

1  The Supreme Court’s Latest Voting Rights Opinion Is Even Worse Than It Seems

You’ve studied equity in education for a long time, and this whole debate makes me wonder if you have thoughts about why education in particular is such a lightning rod for these issues. Why are we always fighting in the schools?
The conversation about curriculum and what people are being taught has such a long, long history. America is dead set on this idea of local control over schools, and in time that extends into the curriculum. Of course, the idea of local control over schools is in part what keeps America’s schools remarkably inequitable, in terms of the funding they receive through local tax dollars and such. But going back even further than that, you saw, during the civil rights movement, the University of Mississippi was almost literally in 1962. You had protests, bombings—

Because they were trying to integrate schools.
Yeah. Schools have historically been this this flashpoint. It comes as no surprise now that when we’re in the wake of another reassessment of American history and the deep inequalities in American society, schools have once again become one of the flashpoints.
I wonder if you look back at that history and think that all this may be the beginning of something rather than the end.

When you have parents literally being arrested protesting this boogeyman of critical race theory in schools, you are seeing a more aggressive pushback to this iteration of reassessment. There are a couple of ways this could go. It’s clear at this point that this boogeyman is not going away anytime soon. And in the conservative publishing ecosystem, there are books coming out soon that will point to critical race theory as something broadly “infecting” American society.

When I think about how we teach race in America, I often in my mind compare it to Germany. After World War II, there was a curriculum implemented where students were taught from a young age about how Hitler rose and why the Nazis came to power. They were explicitly taught that it was wrong. We don’t do anything close to that when it comes to slavery in the United States. And then I think about how Germany is struggling with its own right wing that seems to have come about in spite of this very careful thinking about how we talk about our history and who we are. It makes me wonder, I don’t know if we know how to have this conversation and I don’t know if anyone’s figured it out yet.
I don’t think America has figured out how to talk about race. I don’t think the world more broadly is able to talk about imperialism and the history of colonialism in a way that is consistent what actually happened. I still don’t think we are having those kinds of robust conversations because they’re difficult, because they make people uncomfortable. And when people get uncomfortable, they want to push back and rebel against that feeling of unease.

63,217481,Fox News,2016-09-01,"MSNBC host Joy Reid compared parents who oppose schools teaching critical race theory curriculum to their kids as segregationists.
On Thursday, Reid, host of the MSNBC show ""The Reid Out,"" tweeted out several photos in an effort to compare current activists against critical race theory to race segregationists from the 1950s and 60s.
""A reminder that the earlier versions of these ‘anti-fake CRT parents’ also used their children as fodder and false cries of ""communism"" to enforce their ultra-conservative, white-supremacist vision of America. #uncancelhistory,"" Reid tweeted.
The tweet also contained black-and-white photos of crowds objecting to integrating schools.
This is not the first time Reid has unfavorably described critics of critical race theory. On  Wednesday  , Reid suggested that the grassroots movement to stop critical race theory from entering schools was ""being exploited"" by QAnon and other conspiracy theorists.
CNN SCOLDS CRITICS OF CRITICAL RACE THEORY, SAYS CONCERNED PARENTS DON’T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS
""That hysteria over the perceived encroachment of race-conscious education is being exploited by another insidious force: followers of QAnon who are now using the battle cry to similarly target school boards, with many who have espoused QAnon theories now melding their own conspiracies with the lies about critical race theory,"" Reid claimed.
However, there are many critics of critical race theory curriculum being taught in schools who are Black and have publicly spoken out against it. In  June  , Keisha King, a Black mother, spoke out against critical race theory to the Florida Board of Education.
""I don't know about you, but telling my child or any child that they are in a permanent oppressed status in America because they are Black is racist – and saying that White people are automatically above me, my children, or any child is racist as well. This is not something that we can stand for in our country,"" King said.
Columbia University linguistics professor, John McWhorter,  also tweeted  out against schools teaching critical race theory, encouraging ""truly antiracist parents"" to pull their kids from schools that do.

This also followed one day after CNN was previously mocked for apparently ""gaslighting"" critics of critical race theory. In a segment on Wednesday's ""New Day,"" co-host Brianna Keilar questioned reporter Elle Reeve asking ""Do these vocal opponents of critical race theory actually understand fully what it is?""
""No. Why should they? It’s an academic theory mostly taught at the grad-student level,"" Reeve responded.
Since Sunday, the  National Education Association  declared critical race theory to be 'reasonable and appropriate' for children, despite many progressives and reporters claiming schools aren't teaching critical race theory."
64,217482,Fox News,2016-09-01,"Manhattan Institute senior fellow  Christopher Rufo  once again took aim at MSNBC host  Joy Reid  over her claim that  critical race theory  (CRT) was not being taught in schools following the decision by the  National Education Association  (NEA) to promote the teaching of the controversial ideology.
Rufo, a leading critic of CRT, ripped the left-wing host Monday on both social media and in  an op-ed for the New York Post  , pointing out that the move by the largest teachers union in the nation contradicted Reid's earlier claim that the ideology was only something taught in law schools.
MSNBC'S JOY REID FLAMED FOR BEHAVIOR DURING INTERVIEW WITH CRT CRITIC: ‘NEXT TIME … CONSIDER A REAL DEBATE’
""Joy Reid: Critical race theory is only taught in law schools. NEA: Actually, critical race theory is our #1 priority and we want to implement it in all 50 states and 14,000 local school districts,"" Rufo wrote in a tweet, pointing out the discrepancy in what Reid was claiming versus the NEA's decision.
""Progressives such as MSNBC host Joy Reid can no longer disingenuously claim that critical race theory is only taught in law schools or that it is only a 'lens' for examining American history,"" he wrote in the op-ed. ""The teachers union has nationalized critical race theory and committed to the full range of left-wing radicalism, including opposition to 'capitalism' and 'anthropocentrism.'
In a weekend decision, the NEA approved a plan to ""publicize"" CRT and provide resources to fight back against those speaking out against it. The union went so far as to call the divisive ideology ""reasonable and appropriate"" for young students.
CRITICAL RACE THEORY OPPONENTS TO BE TARGETED, ‘RESEARCHED' BY NEA TEACHERS' UNION
The sudden move by the union contradicted previous left-wing talking points, including Reid's claims, that CRT was not being taught to children in schools because it was too complex for students in the the K-12 age range.
Reid previously made her claim about the teaching of CRT on June 23, during what was supposed to be  a debate  between Rufo and herself on MSNBC over the ideology, but quickly devolved into her constantly interrupting him and not allowing him to speak.
Rufo subsequently  spoke with Fox News  after attempting to debate Reid, and said his research proved the ideology was being taught ""widely"" in schools. He said the media was scared of his message because it was the truth and it was working to let people know the dangers of teaching the subject.

""I think the political left and its enablers in the media are scared of my message because it's the truth and because it's working. Critical race theory, as I've documented in more than a dozen original reports, is being taught widely in American public schools,"" he told Fox. ""And they want to just deny that it's even happening, despite evidence from students, from parents, from teachers, despite now hundreds of different reports from around the country. They know that this is politically toxic. They know that it's intellectually bankrupt, and they just want to hide the truth.""

65,217483,USA TODAY,2016-09-01,"WHAT I DISCOVERED ABOUT CRITICAL RACE THEORY IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND WHY IT SHOULDN'T BE TAUGHT

STATE LEGISLATURES ARE WISE TO BAN SCHOOLS FROM PROMOTING RACE ESSENTIALISM, COLLECTIVE GUILT AND RACIAL SUPERIORITY THEORY.
Christopher F. Rufo  Florida education board backs controversial guidelines on critical race theory Backing DeSantis’ campaign against critical race theory, the Board of Education approved guidelines on the way U.S. history is taught in public schools. Fox - 35 Orlando, Fox - 35 Orlando But despite all of the furor surrounding these bills, many Americans still do not have a firm grasp of what critical race theory is and how it manifests in public schools. I’m a senior fellow with the public policy think tank the Manhattan Institute and have recently completed a  multipart investigative series about critical race theory  in public schools – and what I discovered shocked me to the core.
Critical race theory:  What is it and why do Republicans oppose teaching it in schools?

WHAT IS CRITICAL RACE THEORY?
First, a definition:  Critical race theory is an academic discipline  that claims that the United States was founded on racism, oppression and white supremacy – and that these forces are still at the root of our society. Some supporters of critical race theory claim it is merely a ""  lens  ,"" arguing that ""race is a social construct"" and that racism is ""  systemic  "" not individual, but this is a strategic retreat that fails to grapple with some of the theory's more controversial concepts.
Critical race theory reformulates  the old Marxist dialectic  of oppressor and oppressed, replacing the class categories of bourgeoisie and proletariat with the identity  categories of white and Black  . But the basic conclusion is the same:  In order to liberate man  , society must be fundamentally transformed through moral, economic and political revolution.
We need critical race theory:  My Texas public school sanitized history, facilitated injustice
In simple terms, critical race theory can be seen as a form of “race-based Marxism""; they share a common conceptual framework. Critical race theory was derived from “  critical theory  ,” a 20th century ideology sometimes called “  neo-Marxism  .”

CRITICAL RACE THEORY IN SCHOOLS
To the surprise of many Americans, this basic package of ideas has become part of the curriculum in some school districts across the country. The resulting lessons I’ve discovered through my reporting are deeply divisive and I believe border on political indoctrination:
►In Cupertino, California, an elementary school forced third-graders to  deconstruct  their racial and sexual identities, then rank themselves according to their “  power and privilege  .”
►In Springfield, Missouri, a middle school forced teachers in a  diversity training session  to locate themselves on an “  oppression matrix  .” The trainers told straight, white, English-speaking, Christian males that they are members of the oppressor class and handouts warned of “  covert white supremacy  .”
►In New York City, a public school principal  sent parents  literature including ""  tools for action  "" and touting “white traitors” and advocating for full “white abolition.”
►And in Portland, Oregon, my investigation found that students are not only subjected to a critical race theory curriculum, but also trained to develop their so-called  white identity  and are taught about racial justice in the terms of ""revolution and/or resistance.""
USA TODAY Opinion newsletter:  Get the day's best insights in your inbox  .
In practice, critical race theory in schools is a form of state-sanctioned racism. The lessons traffic in three key concepts: race essentialism, collective guilt and racial superiority theory.
First, these lessons primarily reduce individual students to the racial categories of “white,” “Black” and “people of color,” which are then loaded with value connotations – “white” students are labeled “oppressors,” while “Black” students are labeled “oppressed.”
Don't embrace false equivalents:  Racial equity is important, but it doesn't trump the right to excel
Next, this framework teaches students to think that they bear responsibility for and are the beneficiaries of  historical crimes  committed by individuals who shared the same skin color; consequently, they must atone for their “white privilege."" Critical race theorists in practice sometimes refer to this as ""  internalized racial superiority  "" within white people.
Finally, critical race theory ascribes a moral superiority to individuals based on their race – whites are deemed inherently racist and oppressive because, as a Buffalo Public Schools lesson phrased it, ""  all white people play a part in perpetuating systemic racism  ""; people of color, by contrast, are deemed by this theory inherently virtuous and liberatory.

STATES ARE PUSHING BACK
State legislatures, worried that children will be indoctrinated into this destructive ideology, are absolutely right to prohibit these lessons in public schools. Critical race theorists have the right to express their beliefs as individuals, but taxpayers are not obligated to subsidize their beliefs and incorporate them in the school curriculum.
Legislation prohibiting critical race theory achieves three important protections. First, they protect students’ and teachers’  First Amendment right of conscience  – they cannot be compelled to believe in racial theories that violate their sense of basic dignity. Second, they uphold the basic premise of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees that individuals must be treated equally under the law, regardless of race. Third, the legislation ensures that a state’s public institutions reflect the values of the public – in a representative democracy, voters decide which values to transmit through public schools, and legislators have the right, even the duty, to shape the curriculum to those ends.
Excellence is punished:  Asian American students have a target on their backs thanks to critical race theory
Ultimately, the beauty of the state legislation is that it is politically neutral. The legislation in Texas, for instance,  prohibits schools from requiring  or making part of a course the ideas that any race is “inherently superior to another,” that an individual “bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race,” or that an individual should “receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race.” The bills would outlaw a Ku Klux Klan-sponsored curriculum as well as a CRT-sponsored curriculum.
Liberals, moderates and conservatives should unite behind this simple proposition: Public schools should not promote state-sanctioned racism, no matter the intention and no matter the target. Americans of all backgrounds should support this legislation – and ask why, after decades of progress, some political factions want to drag the country back into the ugly politics of racial division.

66,217484,Fox News,2016-09-01,"In a recent article, Politico denied that school boards are promoting critical race theory in the classroom.
On Wednesday, Politico  published  an article titled ""Could a School-Board Fight Over Critical Race Theory Help Turn Virginia Red?"" Reporter Maya King claimed the current fight against critical race theory is mainly made up of Republicans attempting to take back Congress.
""Republican operatives—some of whom are also parents—are using it as a tool to drive a wide enough wedge in vote-rich Northern counties, to push a blue-leaning state back into tossup territory,"" King wrote.
Within her argument, King also implied that the current grassroots battle parents are facing has no evidence in school districts.
LARGEST TEACHERS UNION SAYS CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS ‘REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE’ FOR KIDS
King wrote ""Last week, GOP candidate Glenn Youngkin even held a campaign rally in front of the Loudoun County school board building to decry critical race theory—even as the school board repeatedly denies teaching it. (Nor is it taught in school districts around the country where conservatives are attempting to ban it.)""
Critical race theory opponent Chris Rufo has  documented  school districts across the country that were implementing critical race theory curriculum. For example public schools in Seattle, tell teachers that the education system is guilty of ""spirit murder"" against black children and that white teachers must ""bankrupt [their] privilege in acknowledgement of [their] thieved inheritance."" Furthermore specifically, documents  revealed  that Loudoun County public schools, the subject of the article, paid more than $34,000 for 55 hours of critical race theory coaching for faculty.
King also appeared to undermine recent arguments by claiming attacks against critical race theory are merely political tools for electing Republicans. King quoted Lissa Savaglio, chair of the Loudoun County Democratic party.
""[Republicans] are going to take everything that people are afraid of, throw it under ‘critical race theory’ and run with it,"" Savaglio said ""And nobody really knows what critical race theory is. So everybody’s just kind of like, ‘Oh, well, that definitely must be what’s happening.’""
King suggested ""[t]here’s systemic and there’s institutional, structural racism that is at play,"" in the schools that required racial reform, quoting Pastor Michelle Thomas, president of the Loudoun NAACP. Nevertheless, she also maintained that most opponents of critical race theory do not know what it is.
""But now, critical race theory, something that few people can clearly define, is dividing parents here,"" she wrote.

This article debuted prior to a recent endorsement of the National Education Association to teach critical race theory in schools. The country’s largest teachers’ union also pledged to focus on several projects aimed to promote the theory more publicly. Their statement read:
""Publicly (through existing media) convey its support for the accurate and honest teaching of social studies topics, including truthful and age-appropriate accountings of unpleasant aspects of American history, such as slavery, and the oppression and discrimination of Indigenous, Black, Brown, and other peoples of color, as well as the continued impact this history has on our current society. The Association will further convey that in teaching these topics, it is reasonable and appropriate for curriculum to be informed by academic frameworks for understanding and interpreting the impact of the past on current society, including critical race theory."""

I'VE BEEN A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AND BLACK STUDIES FOR OVER TWO DECADES. I ALWAYS CHALLENGE MY STUDENTS AND NEVER PLACE RACIAL GUILT ON THEM.
Kevin Cokley  Critical race theory classes at West Point under fire by GOP lawmakers Gen. Mark Milley defends the military against criticism from GOP lawmakers about studying the critical race theory. Staff Video, USA TODAY The  murder of George Floyd  and other  high-profile killings of Black people  last summer prompted a surge of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to provide more education about racism and its harmful effects. Many of these efforts have been linked to  the academic concept called critical race theory  , which posits that racism is not simply acts of individual bias or prejudice, but rather is embedded in institutions, policies and legal systems.
Not surprisingly, CRT has become a  target of America’s ongoing culture wars.  Recently,  Texas became the fifth state  to pass a critical race theory bill,  House Bill 3979  , which states that “a teacher may not be compelled to discuss a particular current event or widely debated and currently controversial issue of public policy or social affairs.” If teachers choose to teach this type of material, they must “to the best of the teacher’s ability, strive to explore the topic from diverse and contending perspectives without giving deference to any one perspective.”  More than a dozen other states  are also considering critical race theory bills.

BANS ON CRT ARE BANS ON US HISTORY
Negative reactions to critical race theory have reached a fever pitch, with news stories depicting  emotional parents  at heated forums decrying what they believe to be the ills of critical race theory. There is now an energized conservative movement fueled by activists and politicians, including Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who claim critical race theory is divisive, hostile and  anti-American  , obsessed with race and ""  hateful lies  ,"" and teaches kids to  hate each other  .
Critical race theory is not hostile, divisive or anti-American. This characterization is a politicized misrepresentation of the theory that prevents and penalizes any discussion of the idea that systemic racism is, unfortunately, still very much present in American society.
Critics of critical race theory use it as an umbrella term to describe any examination of systemic racism. It doesn’t matter whether schools actually teach critical race theory. In some instances,  accusations of teaching critical race theory  are simply teachers  teaching about racism  .
A definition:  What is critical race theory, and why do Republicans oppose teaching it?
While I have never explicitly taught CRT, I do teach about how the systemic racism of American society and the perpetuation of anti-Black messages helped lead to the creation of the  Association of Black Psychologists  . Consistent with CRT, I provide students with examples of how messages of Black deficiency, pathology and inferiority are embedded in school practices (for instance, disproportionately criminalizing the behavior of Black boys and girls).
It appears that the ultimate goal of anti-CRT efforts is to prevent any discussion about racism that presents America as less than perfect. Perhaps people need to be reminded that the first 15 words of the preamble to the Constitution – “  We the People of the United States  , in Order to form a more perfect Union” – suggest that the Founding Fathers understood that America was a work in progress. Critical race theory reminds us that on matters of race, America remains far from perfect and is still a work in progress.

There is nothing insidious or anti-American about acknowledging this fact. One can love America and simultaneously be critical of the ways that  structural racism has perpetuated racial inequities  such as in health care, a fact recognized in a recent article in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.
My journey with CRT:  Critical race theory and loving America are not mutually exclusive
Law professor  Kimberlé Crenshaw  , who coined the term ""critical race theory,"" has suggested that a lot of what is being called critical race theory in the media are ideas that no proponent would agree with.
For example,  a critical race theory bill introduced in West Virginia  forbids teachers from teaching “divisive concepts” such as teaching that “one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex,” and that “an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex.”
However, there is nothing in critical race theory that advocates these beliefs. I've been a professor of psychology and Black Studies for over two decades, and the acknowledgment of historic and current systemic racism has long been an important focus of my teaching. For those who say teaching CRT or about systemic racism is hostile, divisive and obsessed with race and hateful lies, I would beg to differ.

THERE'S NO RACIAL GUILT IN MY CLASSROOM
I have taught a lot about issues related to race and systemic racism and have been rewarded for my teaching excellence by being inducted into both the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Texas System Academy of Distinguished Teachers. I have taught students from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, including many white students. I have taught students with diverse political viewpoints, and I have taught students who have not always agreed with me. In all instances, I challenge my students but also allow myself to be challenged.
I have never taught that one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex, and I have never taught that an individual should be discriminated against because of their race or sex. I have never placed racial guilt on students by separating them between oppressor and oppressed, as alleged in a recent email I received imploring me to defeat CRT in my state.
Racism in America:  Applaud Juneteenth progress but not pushback on critical race theory
To be sure, that’s not to say that there aren’t some CRT proponents whose approaches to teaching critical race theory may be heavy-handed. In such cases, critics should separate CRT from the messenger. Critics should also acknowledge the intellectual diversity among CRT proponents. For example, while some critical race theorists believe  racial discrimination is a permanent condition,  others have more hope  .
The fact of the matter is that critical race theory promotes difficult – but much needed –discussions about race and systemic racism in this country. As the national debate about critical race theory continues, I hope that people will take the time to educate themselves about what is fact vs. what is fiction.

Recently,  Texas became the fifth state  to pass a critical race theory bill,  House Bill 3979  , which states that “a teacher may not be compelled to discuss a particular current event or widely debated and currently controversial issue of public policy or social affairs.” If teachers choose to teach this type of material, they must “to the best of the teacher’s ability, strive to explore the topic from diverse and contending perspectives without giving deference to any one perspective.”  More than a dozen other states  are also considering critical race theory bills.

BANS ON CRT ARE BANS ON US HISTORY
Negative reactions to critical race theory have reached a fever pitch, with news stories depicting  emotional parents  at heated forums decrying what they believe to be the ills of critical race theory. There is now an energized conservative movement fueled by activists and politicians, including Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who claim critical race theory is divisive, hostile and  anti-American  , obsessed with race and ""  hateful lies  ,"" and teaches kids to  hate each other  .
Critical race theory is not hostile, divisive or anti-American. This characterization is a politicized misrepresentation of the theory that prevents and penalizes any discussion of the idea that systemic racism is, unfortunately, still very much present in American society.
Critics of critical race theory use it as an umbrella term to describe any examination of systemic racism. It doesn’t matter whether schools actually teach critical race theory. In some instances,  accusations of teaching critical race theory  are simply teachers  teaching about racism  .
A definition:  What is critical race theory, and why do Republicans oppose teaching it?
While I have never explicitly taught CRT, I do teach about how the systemic racism of American society and the perpetuation of anti-Black messages helped lead to the creation of the  Association of Black Psychologists  . Consistent with CRT, I provide students with examples of how messages of Black deficiency, pathology and inferiority are embedded in school practices (for instance, disproportionately criminalizing the behavior of Black boys and girls).
It appears that the ultimate goal of anti-CRT efforts is to prevent any discussion about racism that presents America as less than perfect. Perhaps people need to be reminded that the first 15 words of the preamble to the Constitution – “  We the People of the United States  , in Order to form a more perfect Union” – suggest that the Founding Fathers understood that America was a work in progress. Critical race theory reminds us that on matters of race, America remains far from perfect and is still a work in progress.

There is nothing insidious or anti-American about acknowledging this fact. One can love America and simultaneously be critical of the ways that  structural racism has perpetuated racial inequities  such as in health care, a fact recognized in a recent article in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.
My journey with CRT:  Critical race theory and loving America are not mutually exclusive
Law professor  Kimberlé Crenshaw  , who coined the term ""critical race theory,"" has suggested that a lot of what is being called critical race theory in the media are ideas that no proponent would agree with.
For example,  a critical race theory bill introduced in West Virginia  forbids teachers from teaching “divisive concepts” such as teaching that “one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex,” and that “an individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex.”
However, there is nothing in critical race theory that advocates these beliefs. I've been a professor of psychology and Black Studies for over two decades, and the acknowledgment of historic and current systemic racism has long been an important focus of my teaching. For those who say teaching CRT or about systemic racism is hostile, divisive and obsessed with race and hateful lies, I would beg to differ.

THERE'S NO RACIAL GUILT IN MY CLASSROOM
I have taught a lot about issues related to race and systemic racism and have been rewarded for my teaching excellence by being inducted into both the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Texas System Academy of Distinguished Teachers. I have taught students from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, including many white students. I have taught students with diverse political viewpoints, and I have taught students who have not always agreed with me. In all instances, I challenge my students but also allow myself to be challenged.
I have never taught that one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex, and I have never taught that an individual should be discriminated against because of their race or sex. I have never placed racial guilt on students by separating them between oppressor and oppressed, as alleged in a recent email I received imploring me to defeat CRT in my state.
Racism in America:  Applaud Juneteenth progress but not pushback on critical race theory
To be sure, that’s not to say that there aren’t some CRT proponents whose approaches to teaching critical race theory may be heavy-handed. In such cases, critics should separate CRT from the messenger. Critics should also acknowledge the intellectual diversity among CRT proponents. For example, while some critical race theorists believe  racial discrimination is a permanent condition,  others have more hope  .
The fact of the matter is that critical race theory promotes difficult – but much needed –discussions about race and systemic racism in this country. As the national debate about critical race theory continues, I hope that people will take the time to educate themselves about what is fact vs. what is fiction.

Doug Ducey  Doug Ducey  Arizona governor signs bill to prohibit critical race theory teaching  Trump-allied GOP chairs turn on fellow Republicans  Most Americans think surge of illegal border crossings is a crisis  MORE  (R) signed a bill on Friday preventing local governments from teaching critical race theory. The measure, House Bill 2906, prohibits “the state and any local governments from requiring their employees to engage in orientation, training or therapy that suggest an employee is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously,” Ducey’s office  said in a statement  .
The Arizona state House passed the bill in a 31-25 vote, according to  records from the state legislature  . The state Senate passed the bill on a 16-12 vote.
ADVERTISEMENT The measure comes as critical race theory becomes the latest flashing point in the culture wars. The theory, which is decades old, examines the impact of racism on history and maintains that racism is systemic.
But Republicans have used the term critical race theory as a catch-all for teaching racism, with some panning the theory as discriminatory.
Several GOP states have enacted laws blocking or limiting the teaching of critical race theory in schools, and multiple others are considering such legislation.
Ducey last week signed a separate bill aimed at teaching critical race theory in schools. That law,  HB2898  , dictates that schools cannot teach that one race or ethnic group is superior to another, or that a person by virtue of their race is racist.
In response to the laws, the American Federation of Teachers, one of the nation’s largest teacher’s unions, has  pledged  to defend members who teach “honest history” of the United States. The National Education Association has made a similar pledge."

Getty Images With today’s release of the  Fed’s June minutes  there was more color on what the Fed expects for inflation, and what transitory inflation might look like. Of course,  further important inflation data will come in July  , but the minutes provide further detail on the Fed’s thinking. Currently there is  no expectation that the Fed will raise rates in response to the inflation surge  .

TRANSITORY MAY MEAN ABOUT 6-9 MONTHS
Despite using the term transitory for the current  5% inflation  we are seeing, the Fed hasn’t precisely defined the term. The notes reveal that the Fed generally expects elevated inflation for the remainder of this year, but sees inflation moderating into 2022. That implies elevated inflation may be with us for another several months from here. Not all Fed policy-makers share this view, with some suspecting inflation may linger further into 2022.
The Fed is also, to some degree, keying off market expectations. These suggest higher inflation in the short-term, but without much of an impact on long-term market inflation expectations after a year or two.

BASE EFFECTS MATTER
The Fed believes that base effects are one important driver of the current surge in inflation. Last year, at around this time, inflation was very subdued. In 2021 we are seeing inflation catch up with last year’s unusual drop, the Fed reasons. This implies that though inflation may remain elevated, this base rate effect will cause inflation to begin to calm over the coming months, just as comparatively, inflation picked up off low levels toward the end of 2020.

SUPPLY BOTTLENECKS
As we are seeing in many areas, the main driver of inflation is supply bottlenecks as the economy reopen. This paired with robust consumer demand is putting upward pressure on prices. Again, the Fed sees these unusual disruptions to the economy moderating into 2022 as global supply chains work out their current issues.
By  By

WHAT COULD CHANGE THE FED’S OUTLOOK
In outlining its view on inflation, the Fed also makes clear what could change it. Indeed, even now the high rate of inflation is something of a surprise and the notes make clear, that for many on the committee, “the actual rise in inflation was larger than anticipated.” However, despite that the Fed doesn’t appear too concerned yet.
Given that base rates are expected to be a key driver, if inflation doesn’t show a downward trend over the coming months as we start to compare with higher inflation levels from the corresponding months in 2020, that may prove a concern for the Fed. While inflation may be high for a while, if we aren’t heading into a rate far closer to the Fed’s 2% inflation target by early 2022, that too will be a concern for the Fed’s transitory inflation thesis.
Finally, given that supply bottlenecks are seen as a key inflation driver, the Fed would hope to see these broadly resolved by 2022. In summary, for inflation to prove transitory the Fed would want to see inflation on a broadly declining trend from here, but with inflation remaining higher than normal into early 2022. If that doesn’t happen, then monetary policy, might have to adjust with a corresponding impact on markets and  appropriate investment strategies  . That adjustment may not be pleasant, as that most believe any rate hike is several years out currently."
77,217495,The Economic Times,2016-09-01,"For months, the United States has been experiencing the growing pains of an economy rebooting itself — surging economic activity, yes, but also shortages, gummed-up supply networks and higher prices. Now shifts in financial markets point to a reversal of that economic narrative. Specifically, the bond market has swung in ways that suggest that a period of slower growth and more subdued  inflation  could lie ahead. The yield on 10-year  Treasury  bonds fell to 1.29 per cent Thursday, down from a recent high of 1.75 per cent at the end of March and the fourth straight trading day of decline. The closing price of inflation-protected  bonds  implied expectations of consumer price inflation at 2.25 per cent a year over the coming decade, down from 2.54 per cent in early May. These are hardly panic-worthy numbers. They are not the kind of jaw-dropping swings that markets show in moments of extreme turbulence, and analysts attribute the moves in significant part to technical factors as big investors shift their portfolios. Moreover, there is a reasonable argument that the economy will be better over the medium term if it experiences moderate growth and low inflation as opposed to the kind of breakneck growth — paired with shortages and inflation — seen in the past few months. But the price swings do show an economy in flux, and they undermine arguments that the United States is settling into a new, high-inflation reality for the indefinite future. In effect, the bet in markets on explosive growth and resulting inflation is giving way to a more mixed story. The economy remains hot at the moment; the quarter that just ended will most likely turn out to be one of the strongest for growth in history. But market prices aim to reflect the future, not the present, and the future is looking less buoyant than it did not long ago. The peak months for injection of federal stimulus dollars into the economy have passed. The legislative outlook for major federal initiatives on infrastructure and family support has become murkier. The rapid spread of the delta variant of COVID-19 has brought new concern for the global economic outlook, especially in places with low vaccination rates. That, in turn, could both hold back demand for U.S. exports and cause continued supply problems that result in slower growth in the United States. “The overriding concern being reflected in the bond market is that peak growth has been reached, and the benefits from fiscal policy are starting to fade,” Sophie Griffiths, a market analyst with the foreign exchange brokerage  Oanda  , said in a research note. The evidence of a more measured growth path was evident, for example, in a report from the  Institute for Supply Management  this week. It showed the service sector was continuing to expand rapidly in June but considerably less rapidly than it had in May. Anecdotes included in the report supported the idea that supply problems were holding back the pace of expansion. “Business conditions continue to rebound; however, like everywhere, the challenges in the supply chain are numerous,” reported one anonymous retailer that participated in the ISM survey. “We continue to see cost increases, delayed shipments, pushed-out lead times, and no clarity as to when predictive balance returns to this market.” The bond market shifts could leave the  Federal Reserve  wrong-footed in contemplating plans to unwind its efforts to support the economy. At a policy meeting three weeks ago, some Fed officials were ready to proceed with tapering bond purchases in the near future, and some expected to raise interest rates next year, in contrast with a more patient approach that Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, has advocated. In one of the odder paradoxes of monetary policy, what was perceived in markets as greater openness at the Fed to raising interest rates has contributed to declines in long-term interest rates. Global investors are betting that potential preemptive monetary tightening will cause a stronger dollar, slower growth and less ability for the Fed to raise rates in the future without tanking the economy. “The market read the views of the minority within the Fed about tapering and about raising rates as signals the Fed has blinked on its decision to allow the economy to run hot,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief U.S. economist at Mizuho Securities. “A weaker global economy and stronger U.S. dollar all imply greater potential for us to import global deflation.” There are silver linings to the reassessment taking place in markets. Lower long-term rates make borrowing cheaper for Americans — whether that is Congress and the Biden administration considering how to pay for infrastructure plans, or homebuyers trying to afford a house. And the adjustment in bond prices can give Fed officials more confidence that inflation is set to be consistent with their goals in the years ahead, even as businesses face supply shortages and spiking wages at the moment. For example, bond prices now imply that inflation will be 2.1 per cent per year between five and 10 years from now, down from expectations of 2.4 per cent in early May. The Fed aims for 2 per cent inflation (though targeting a different inflation measure from the one that is used in the value of inflation-protected bonds). That could make it less likely the Fed acts prematurely out of fear that inflation will get out of control, recent communication problems notwithstanding. Markets are not all-knowing, and the signals being sent by bond prices could turn out to be wrong. But investors with, collectively, trillions of dollars on the line are betting that the rip-roaring economy of summer 2021 is going to give way to something a good bit less exciting."
78,217496,ABC News,2016-09-01,"WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials started discussing at their meeting last month the timing and mechanics of reducing their huge monthly bond purchases, which are used to keep longer-term interest rates in check.
The debate, revealed in the minutes of the Feds June meeting released Wednesday, reflected a broadly positive outlook on the economy among Fed policymakers but also some concern that higher inflation could prove more persistent than the central bank has previously indicated. Still, economists saw little sign that the Fed was any closer to hiking interest rates or reducing its bond buys.
A few policymakers mentioned that they expected the conditions for beginning to reduce bond purchases would be met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated ... in light of incoming data, the minutes said.
The Fed is buying $120 billion a month in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds to keep longer-term interest rates low and encourage more borrowing and spending. Those purchases have flooded financial markets with cash, potentially fueling asset bubbles, some economists have argued. The Fed has said that it will keep making the purchases until the economy makes substantial further progress toward its goals of full employment and an inflation rate slightly above 2%.
But there is a clear split on the Fed's policymaking committee, with some officials cautioning that recent economic reports provide a less clear signal about the underlying economic momentum. The June 15-16 meeting was held before the most recent jobs report, which showed the economy had gained 850,000 new positions last month.
Several of these (officials) emphasized that the (Fed) should be patient about making any changes to its bond purchase plans, the minutes said.
Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics, a consulting firm, said the minutes were not as hawkish as we suspected. In Fed parlance, hawks typically worry more about inflation and are less concerned with keeping unemployment low, while doves take the opposite view.
There seems to be only limited support for beginning to taper the monthly asset purchases anytime soon, Ashworth said.
After the June meeting, the Fed issued a statement and a set of economic projections that signaled that it would potentially dial back its low-interest rate policies earlier than it had previously projected. The policymakers forecast that they would hike the Fed's benchmark short-term interest rate twice by the end of 2023. In March, they had indicated no rate hikes would occur before 2024.
The minutes showed Fed officials expressed optimism about the economy, even as they said it was still far from meeting their employment and inflation goals.
Policymakers observed that economic activity was expanding at a historically rapid pace, led by robust gains in consumer spending, the minutes said.
Most Fed officials expected inflation to decline in the coming months as some supply chain bottlenecks eased, the minutes said. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said that recent jumps in consumer prices would be temporary and largely reflected disruptions surrounding the reopening of the economy.
But a substantial majority of policymakers said that there was a risk inflation could stay higher than expected, because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed.
Most economists still expect a reduction, or tapering, of bond purchases to begin by late this year or early next year, with an announcement of the change potentially occurring in late August at the Fed's annual conference at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Some differences over the timing of the tapering have emerged among the Fed's regional bank presidents, with Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan saying last week that he favored pulling back on the purchases sooner rather than later.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, in an interview with The Associated Press, said last week that it would be appropriate to consider tapering later this year or early next year. But she cautioned that the economy is far from full employment."""
79,217497,International Business Times,2016-09-01,"Rising prices amid the recovery from the pandemic shutdown were predicted, but the recent jump in US inflation was higher than Federal Reserve officials had expected, the Fed said Wednesday.
Given a risk that prices will remain higher for some time, officials stressed the central bank will need to be ready to pull back on its massive bond-buying program, but offered no concrete hints on when that will happen, according to the minutes of the June 15-16 monetary policy meeting.
As the US economy reopened, supply bottlenecks and a surge in consumer spending as well as trouble finding workers have pushed inflation well beyond the central bank's 2.0 percent target, rising to 3.6 in April, officials said.
While temporary factors had been expected to boost inflation and then recede, ""the actual rise in inflation was larger than anticipated.""
The members of the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) ""attributed the upside surprise to more widespread supply constraints in product and labor markets... and to a larger-than-expected surge in consumer demand as the economy reopened.""
Companies nationwide have complained about trouble finding and keeping workers, as well as rising prices for products like lumber, plastic and fuel.

Amid the rapid pace of the rebound, Fed officials boosted their inflation forecasts at the meeting to a median of 3.4 percent.
The minutes noted that ""a substantial majority of participants judged that the risks to their inflation projections were tilted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages.""
The Fed cut the benchmark lending rate to zero in the early weeks of the pandemic and has been buying $120 billion a month in bonds, to provide liquidity to the economy, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month said officials are beginning to talk about when to tap the brakes on the asset purchases.
Participants at the meeting said it would be ""prudent"" to be prepared ""to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments,"" including if the US economy reaches full employment and inflation over 2 percent faster than anticipated.
But they said they would provide notice ""well in advance"" of any changes, the minutes said. That should reassure financial markets that they will not be taken by surprise.
FOMC members are still divided on whether to cut back on buying mortgage-backed securities first given the hot housing market, or to reduce purchases of US Treasury debt and MBS in tandem."

82,217500,@nytimes,2016-09-01,"For months, the United States has been experiencing the growing pains of an economy rebooting itself surging economic activity, yes, but also shortages, gummed-up supply networks and higher prices.
Now, shifts in financial markets point to a reversal of that economic narrative. Specifically, the bond market has swung in ways that suggest that a period of slower growth and more subdued inflation could lie ahead.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell to 1.29 percent on Thursday, down from a recent high of 1.75 percent at the end of March and the fourth straight trading day of decline. The closing price of inflation-protected bonds implied expectations of consumer price inflation at 2.25 percent a year over the coming decade, down from 2.54 percent in early May.
These are hardly panic-worthy numbers. They are not the kind of jaw-dropping swings that markets show in moments of extreme turbulence, and analysts attribute the moves in significant part to technical factors as big investors shift their portfolios.
Moreover, there is a reasonable argument that the economy will be better over the medium term if it experiences moderate growth and low inflation, as opposed to the kind of breakneck growth paired with shortages and inflation seen in the last few months.
But the price swings do show an economy in flux, and they undermine arguments that the United States is settling into a new, high-inflation reality for the indefinite future.
In effect, the bet in markets on explosive growth and resulting inflation is giving way to a more mixed story. The economy remains hot at the moment; the quarter that just ended will most likely turn out to be one of the strongest for growth in history. But market prices aim to reflect the future, not the present, and the future is looking less buoyant than it did not long ago.
The peak months for injection of federal stimulus dollars into the economy have passed. The legislative outlook for major federal initiatives on infrastructure and family support has become murkier. The rapid spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19 has brought new concern for the global economic outlook, especially in places with low vaccination rates. That, in turn, could both hold back demand for American exports and cause continued supply problems that result in slower growth in the United States.
The overriding concern being reflected in the bond market is that peak growth has been reached, and the benefits from fiscal policy are starting to fade, said Sophie Griffiths, a market analyst with the foreign exchange brokerage Oanda, in a research note.
The evidence of a more measured growth path was evident, for example, in a report from the Institute for Supply Management this week. It showed the service sector was continuing to expand rapidly in June, but considerably less rapidly than it had in May. Anecdotes included in the report supported the idea that supply problems were holding back the pace of expansion.
Business conditions continue to rebound; however, like everywhere, the challenges in the supply chain are numerous, reported one anonymous retailer that participated in the I.S.M. survey. We continue to see cost increases, delayed shipments, pushed-out lead times, and no clarity as to when predictive balance returns to this market.
The bond market shifts could leave the Federal Reserve wrong-footed in contemplating plans to unwind its efforts to support the economy. At a policy meeting three weeks ago, some Fed officials were ready to proceed with tapering bond purchases in the near future, and some expected to raise interest rates next year, in contrast with a more patient approach that Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, has advocated.
In one of the odder paradoxes of monetary policy, what was perceived in markets as greater openness at the Fed to raising interest rates has contributed to declines in long-term interest rates. Global investors are betting that potential pre-emptive monetary tightening will cause a stronger dollar, slower growth and less ability for the Fed to raise rates in the future without tanking the economy.
The market read the views of the minority within the Fed about tapering and about raising rates as signals the Fed has blinked on its decision to allow the economy to run hot, said Steven Ricchiuto, chief U.S. economist at Mizuho Securities. A weaker global economy and stronger U.S. dollar all imply greater potential for us to import global deflation.
There are silver linings to the reassessment taking place in markets. Lower long-term rates make borrowing cheaper for Americans whether that is Congress and the Biden administration considering how to pay for infrastructure plans, or home buyers trying to afford a house.
And the adjustment in bond prices can give Fed officials more confidence that inflation is set to be consistent with their goals in the years ahead, even as businesses face supply shortages and spiking wages at the moment.
For example, bond prices now imply that inflation will be 2.1 percent per year between five and 10 years from now, down from expectations of 2.4 percent in early May. The Fed aims for 2 percent inflation (though targeting a different inflation measure from the one that is used in the value of inflation-protected bonds).
That could make it less likely the Fed acts prematurely out of fear that inflation will get out of control, recent communication problems notwithstanding.
Markets arent all-knowing, and the signals being sent by bond prices could turn out to be wrong. But investors with, collectively, trillions of dollars on the line are betting that the rip-roaring economy of summer 2021 is going to give way to something a good bit less exciting."
83,217501,TheHill,2016-09-01,"Federal Reserve officials debated last month how quickly they would need to begin pulling back support for the U.S. economy as both the pace of recovery and inflation exceed their expectations.
Minutes from the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed’s monetary policymaking arm, released Wednesday showed increasing concern among some officials that the bank would be forced to hike rates or pare back bond purchases sooner than they had projected.
After the meeting, the Fed officials voted unanimously to keep the baseline interest range at 0 to 0.25 percent and said it would continue to purchase $120 billion combined in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities until the economy showed “substantial further progress” toward a full recovery.
ADVERTISEMENT But minutes from that meeting showed a debate heating up among some Fed officials over how soon they would have to begin easing that support or whether the economy would continue to keep up its current pace.
“A substantial majority of participants judged that the risks to their inflation projections were tilted to the upside,” the minutes read. Those officials cited concerns about supply chain disruptions, which have pushed prices for many goods higher, and hiring troubles among many industries hit hard by the pandemic, including leisure, hospitality and manufacturing.
Other officials countered that the supply shortages and short-term factors pushing inflation higher could phase out even sooner than expected, making it too soon to accelerate tapering.
“Several of these participants emphasized that the Committee should be patient in assessing progress toward its goals and in announcing changes to its plans for asset purchases,” the minutes read.
Following the June meeting, Fed officials also upgraded their forecasts for economic growth and inflation from their projections in March. No Fed official expected the bank to hike interest rates until 2022 at the earliest but several anticipated a quicker, sooner series of rate increases.

Inflation was largely expected to rise in 2021 after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic caused prices to plunge along with economic activity. Even though inflation was expected to rise based on prices correcting toward normal levels, severe supply chain disruptions has put much greater pressure on prices than had been anticipated.
The median projection of annual inflation among Fed officials rose from 2.4 percent in March to 3.4 percent, but both Fed leaders and staff economists expect inflation to fall back toward 2 percent in the following years.

WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve officials started discussing at their meeting last month the timing and mechanics of reducing their huge monthly bond purchases, which are used to keep longer-term interest rates in check.
The debate, revealed in the minutes of the Fed’s June meeting released Wednesday, reflected a broadly positive outlook on the economy among Fed policy makers but also some concern that higher inflation could prove more persistent than the central bank has previously indicated. Still, economists saw little sign that the Fed was any closer to hiking interest rates or reducing its bond buys.
A few policy makers “mentioned that they expected the conditions for beginning to reduce” bond purchases would “be met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated . . . in light of incoming data,” the minutes said.

The Fed is buying $120 billion a month in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds to keep longer-term interest rates low and encourage more borrowing and spending. Those purchases have flooded financial markets with cash, potentially fueling asset bubbles, some economists have argued. The Fed has said that it will keep making the purchases until the economy makes “substantial further progress” toward its goals of full employment and an inflation rate slightly above 2 percent.
But there is a clear split on the Fed’s policy-making committee, with “some officials” cautioning that recent economic reports provide “a less clear signal about the underlying economic momentum.” The June 15-16 meeting was held before the most recent jobs report, which showed the economy had gained 850,000 new positions last month.
“Several of these [officials] emphasized that the [Fed] should be patient” about making any changes to its bond purchase plans, the minutes said.
Paul Ashworth, chief US economist for Capital Economics, a consulting firm, said the minutes “were not as hawkish as we suspected.” In Fed parlance, “hawks” typically worry more about inflation and are less concerned with keeping unemployment low, while “doves” take the opposite view.
“There seems to be only limited support for beginning to taper the monthly asset purchases anytime soon,” Ashworth said.
After the June meeting, the Fed issued a statement and a set of economic projections that signaled that it would potentially dial back its low-interest rate policies earlier than it had previously projected.

86,217504,Mail Online,2016-09-01,"Federal Reserve said supply bottlenecks and a labor shortage could keep inflation higher than they had previously expected
Rising prices amid the recovery from the pandemic shutdown were predicted, but the recent jump in US inflation was higher than Federal Reserve officials had expected, the Fed said Wednesday.
Given a risk that prices will remain higher for some time, officials stressed the central bank will need to be ready to pull back on its massive bond-buying program, but offered no concrete hints on when that will happen, according to the minutes of the June 15-16 monetary policy meeting.
As the US economy reopened, supply bottlenecks and a surge in consumer spending as well as trouble finding workers have pushed inflation well beyond the central bank's 2.0 percent target, rising to 3.6 in April, officials said.
While temporary factors had been expected to boost inflation and then recede, ""the actual rise in inflation was larger than anticipated.""
The members of the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) ""attributed the upside surprise to more widespread supply constraints in product and labor markets... and to a larger-than-expected surge in consumer demand as the economy reopened.""
Companies nationwide have complained about trouble finding and keeping workers, as well as rising prices for products like lumber, plastic and fuel.
Amid the rapid pace of the rebound, Fed officials boosted their inflation forecasts at the meeting to a median of 3.4 percent.
The minutes noted that ""a substantial majority of participants judged that the risks to their inflation projections were tilted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages.""
The Fed cut the benchmark lending rate to zero in the early weeks of the pandemic and has been buying $120 billion a month in bonds, to provide liquidity to the economy, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month said officials are beginning to talk about when to tap the brakes on the asset purchases.
Participants at the meeting said it would be ""prudent"" to be prepared ""to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments,"" including if the US economy reaches full employment and inflation over 2 percent faster than anticipated.
But they said they would provide notice ""well in advance"" of any changes, the minutes said. That should reassure financial markets that they will not be taken by surprise.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve says that its low interest rate policies are providing “powerful support” for the economy as it recovers from the coronavirus pandemic.
In its twice-a-year report to Congress on monetary policy released Friday, the Fed indicated that it plans to maintain that support until further progress is made in recovering from last year’s severe recession.
Progress on vaccinations helped to reopen the economy and produced strong economic growth over the first half of this year, the Fed noted. But the lingering effects of the pandemic still weigh on the economy, with employment well below pre-pandemic levels.
The central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate near zero, while continuing to buy $120 billion a month in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates. It said Friday that these efforts will help ensure that “monetary policy continues to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.”
The new report will be the subject of two days of hearings next week. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will testify Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee, and Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee.
ADVERTISEMENT Lawmakers will seek details on exactly when the central bank will start cutting back on its bond purchases, and when it will begin raising interest rates.
The report Friday repeated wording used by the central bank since last year, explaining that it does not expect to begin raising interest rates until its goals on maximum employment and inflation have been reached.
It also reiterated the Fed’s expectation that monthly bond purchases will remain at the level of $120 billion “until substantial further progress has been made” toward its employment and inflation goals.
Shortages of materials and difficulties in hiring have had held back activity in a number of industries, and bottlenecks so far this year and other transitory factors have boosted inflation, according to the report.
“Consumer price inflation has increased notably this spring as a surge in demand has run up again production bottlenecks and hiring difficulties,” the report read.
But the report repeated the view of Powell and other Fed officials that any spike in inflation is likely to be temporary.
“As these extraordinary circumstances pass, supply and demand should move closer to balance, and inflation is widely expected to move down,” the report stated.
However, the Fed report also stated that “upside risks to the inflation outlook in the near term have increased,” raising the possibility that the spike in inflation could last longer than first expected.
“The discussion of inflation developments emphasized the temporary, but likely more persistent than originally expected, inflation overshoot that was currently underway,” said Krishna Guha, an analyst with investment bank Evercore ISI.
Minutes of the  discussions at the Fed’s last meeting in June  showed that central bank officials began consideration of when and how they will start reducing the bond purchases but that no conclusions were reached. Most private economists don’t expect the actual bond tapering to begin until late this year or perhaps not until early in 2022."
89,217507,MarketWatch,2016-09-01,"The Federal Reserve acknowledged it was caught off guard by soaring inflation this year and that it was less certain about how fast the price increases would unwind, internal notes from its last big meeting show.
The Fed’s chief decision-making body, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, stuck its forecast that the annual rate of inflation would fall back toward 2% by next year. Prices are rising at almost double that rate right now.

Yet at the June 14-15 meeting, senior central bankers admitted they underestimated the rise in inflation this year.
Consumer prices shot up 3.9% in the 12 months ended in May, reflecting the biggest gain since 2008, based on the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge known as the PCE. The rate of inflation is nearly twice as high as the Fed’s 2% goal.

Also:  There’s plenty of jobs, but not enough people to fill them. How come?
Top officials blamed the rise in inflation on higher oil prices and a bigger-than-expected surge in the economy this spring.
The crush of demand has created major shortages of key supplies such as computer chips, a problem compounded by the inability of companies to fill a record number of open jobs. They have had to raise wages or in some cases cut back on production because of these bottlenecks, the Fed noted.
“[A] substantial majority of participants judged that the risks to their inflation projections were tilted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed,” the notes said.

A few FOMC members seemed especially worried, suggesting the bout of higher inflation would persist into next year and perhaps beyond.
Most top Fed officials still insisted inflation would taper off by next year, though.
After the June meeting, the Fed jacked up its median estimate of inflation in 2021 to 3.4% from as low as 1.8% just six months earlier. Yet the FOMC still predicts the rate of inflation will slow to 2.1% in 2022.
Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed leaders insist prices will ease as the economy returns to normal, most people go back to work and widespread shortages of labor and supplies fade away. They point out that inflation has been low for years before the pandemic erupted in the U.S. in early 2020."

92,217510,Mail Online,2016-09-01,"FRANKFURT, July 8 (Reuters) - Setting out a policy strategy shift on Thursday, the European Central Bank left many questions unanswered but made one point abundantly clear: it would not follow its U.S. counterpart in targeting an average level of inflation.
The fact that it put distance between the two regimes in such a stark way reflects both the ECB's own struggles and the U.S. Federal Reserve's difficulty in communicating how average inflation-targeting actually works and impacts policy.
The following are five takeaways on why the ECB did not copy the Fed.
POLITICS
Average inflation-targeting means making an explicit commitment to overshooting your target after missing it for a longer period. That would be a big no-no for inflation-wary Germany, the region's largest economy.
ECB President Christine Lagarde said a temporary overshoot might happen and in some situations the ECB would put in place policies that resulted in such a swing. But that is still not a goal and falls short of the Fed's overshoot commitment.
This may be seen as a victory for Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann who has persistently rejected the idea of shooting for price growth above the target.
""Are we doing average inflation-targeting like the Fed? The answer is no, very squarely,"" Lagarde told a news conference
BIGGER
The ECB's own inflation misses have been much bigger than the Fed's, so getting an average would mean bigger overshoots.
Last year's inflation averaged just 0.3%, well below the ECB's 2% target, while in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic, inflation was 1.2%.
Offsetting these is all but impossible. It would mean huge overshoots with a nearly depleted policy arsenal, a combination that would challenge the ECB's credibility. Even if there was policy space for such swing, political opposition would be overwhelming. Moreover, gyrations on such a scale would not be healthy for an economy.
FLEXIBILITY
The ECB has tailored its entire strategy towards flexibility. It targets inflation over a medium term, an undefined, vague concept, while its tolerance for deviations is similarly loosely worded to give the Governing Council maximum flexibility.
The bank's guidance on future policy moves is also imprecise, so moving to a Fed-style average would actually reduce that cherished flexibility.
MESSY
Targeting average inflation over a period is messy. It requires the central bank to define a time period and a specific inflation measure it looks at.
Markets then hold the central bank accountable and price assets accordingly. Such a framework either reduces the ECB's flexibility or, if it does not specify the terms of the framework, will leave markets confused, causing asset price volatility.
THE FED'S STRUGGLES
The Fed's own difficulties also dissuaded the ECB.
The Fed decided on Flexible Average Inflation Targeting last August but has been widely criticised for not defining how much of an overshoot would be allowed over what length of time.
A year later the picture is still not clear. In fact, different inflation forecasts and different sensitivities to inflation risk have left a broad division among policymakers. Some see rate increases already next year while some expect the first move only in 2024.

The report will be the subject of hearings in Congress next week, including testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell about the outlook for the economy, inflation, and the transition of  monetary policy  as the impact of the pandemic recedes.
The report released by the Fed on Friday is largely backward-looking, but it documents the central bank's view that the recovery remains on track as firms and families navigate a complicated economic reopening.
Prices have risen faster than expected, for example, and while the supply bottlenecks and other factors driving the price hikes are expected to ease over time, ""upside risks to the inflation outlook in the near term have increased,"" the Fed said.

Hiring has also slowed for an unexpected reason: Companies want to bring on more employees, but not enough workers are ready to take those  jobs  as they cope with ongoing health and family concerns and can rely on continued  federal unemployment benefits  to help pay the bills.
""Many of these factors should have a diminishing effect on participation in the coming months,"" the Fed said, though the speed and strength of that labor  market  recovery also remains uncertain.

The central bank, however, said available data suggest ""a further robust increase in demand"" occurred from April through June.
""Against a backdrop of elevated household savings, accommodative financial conditions, ongoing fiscal support, and the reopening of the economy, the strength in household spending has persisted,"" while the financial system remains ""resilient,"" the Fed said.

95,217513,Reuters,2016-09-01,"WASHINGTON, July 8 (Reuters) - It is an article of faith among central bankers that the decisions they make about how much money to create and what interest rate to charge for it will determine the rate of inflation - at least over moderate lengths of time.
For more than a decade that belief has been undermined by inflation that has remained weak despite trillions of dollars pumped into the world's biggest economies through quantitative easing programs and ultra-low interest rates.
That prompted the top central banks to review how they do business, and on Thursday the European Central Bank joined the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan in pursuing an ambitious reset in hopes of reasserting control.  read more

The ECB's new framework, in contemplating the occasional ""transitory period"" when inflation exceeds its formal 2% target in hopes of ensuring that target is met over time, is a step short of the more explicit promise the U.S. central bank made last year to encourage periods of high inflation to offset years when price increases were too weak.
But their shared diagnosis paints a similarly troubling picture of a developed world seemingly set in a rut of slow economic growth, low productivity, aging populations, and perennially weak inflation that may be difficult to coax higher.
""The euro area economy and the global economy have been undergoing profound structural changes,"" the ECB said in announcing its new framework, echoing language used by Fed officials in announcing their new strategy last year. ""Declining trend growth, which can be linked to slower productivity growth and demographic factors, and the legacy of the global financial crisis have driven down equilibrium real interest rates.""
That, in turn, has given the ECB less room to use interest rate policy alone to help boost economic activity, and forced it, like the Fed, to resort more often to other measures - bond-buying for example - when economic conditions weaken.
The BOJ led the way down that path early this century.
The aims of the new U.S. and European inflation strategies, and those pursued so far unsuccessfully in Japan, are the same: Get the pace of price increases high enough so inflation-adjusted interest rates can also increase, giving the central banks room to use rate cuts as their main policy tool in times of stress.
CHASING AN AVERAGE
The concept of using inflation averaging has been slow to evolve. All three central banks at first adopted simple inflation targets of 2%, trusting that they understood inflation dynamics well enough to hit that level and stay there.
They didn't.
Over time, they realized that between technology, globalization, demographics and other factors, inflation had become difficult to budge. Even more problematic, the continued ""misses"" against a well-publicized target risked resetting public expectations that inflation would remain weak.
Research by current and former Fed officials raised the stakes. They found that in a situation where equilibrium interest rates were low and central banks were repeatedly forced to cut their policy rates to near zero, inflation expectations would fall - permanently, a damaging outcome that would cement weak prices, wages, and growth as the norm.
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, whose earlier academic research affirmed the advantages of simple inflation targeting, detailed this past January how subsequent studies by New York Fed President John Williams and others concluded more aggressive approaches were needed when interest rates were expected to keep collapsing to zero.
Interest rates stuck near zero ""tend to deliver inflation expectations that, in each business cycle, become anchored at a level below the target,"" Clarida said in a presentation to Stanford University's Hoover Institution. ""It can open up the risk of the downward spiral in both actual and expected inflation that has been observed in some other major economies.""
'HISTORIC SHIFT'
The Fed's new policy has been in place for just over 10 months. Its experience shows the challenges the ECB now faces.
The coronavirus pandemic and subsequent economic reopening have complicated the inflation outlook, with supply bottlenecks driving up prices more than - and perhaps for longer than - anticipated and a labor squeeze starting to drive up workers' pay.
That has led to some new hawkish voices inside the Fed and hints at faster interest rate hikes from the U.S. central bank despite its stated promise to let inflation run above target ""for some time.""
With the Fed yet to prove its new design in practice, bond markets have noticed.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note , far from anticipating higher inflation and growth, has been falling, and on Thursday hit 1.25%, the lowest level since mid-February and a drop of nearly half a percentage point from mid-May.
As with the Fed, the ECB will have to translate its new strategy into policies that work.
The new strategy marks ""a historic shift for the ECB,"" by acknowledging inflation may need to exceed 2% at some point, wrote Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist for Capital Economics. But it ""will not make it easy for the ECB to escape from the grips of low inflation.""

99,217517,The Independent,2016-09-01,"Former  president  Donald Trump  criticised the way people accused of participating in the riot on Capitol Hill are being treated on Wednesday.
“People are being treated unbelievably unfairly,” Mr Trump said. “When you look at people in prison and nothing happens to Antifa and they burned down cities and killed people.” He also mentioned there were no guns in the Capitol.
“Except for the gun that shot Ashli Babbitt,” he said, in reference to the military veteran whom a Capitol police officer killed during the riot that was an attempt to stop the certification of electoral college votes for the 2020 presidential race. The former president  has mentioned her name  in recent weeks.
“There was no reason for that,” he said.
Mr. Trump’s comments came during his announcement that  he would sue tech companies  including Twitter and Facebook in response to their banning him.
A reporter asked Mr Trump about what he did, if anything, to stop the riot given the bans were made largely in response to the attempted insurrection and why he was not able to stop it. Mr. Trump mentioned a Senate report and that “my name wasn’t even mentioned.”
But while the Senate report  did not dig into the root causes  of the riot, such as Mr Trump telling his supporters to “fight like hell,” the report does mention his name multiple times."

101,217519,RT International,2016-09-01,"Donald Trump has revealed that he plans on and is committed to giving a deposition in the recently announced class-action lawsuit against the Big Tech companies Facebook, Twitter, and Google. After announcing that he would be the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the various social media companies who banned his accounts following the January 6 Capitol riot, Trump expanded on his role in the suit in an interview with Bill O’Reilly.
“I look forward to it, actually,”  the former president said, when asked about sitting for a deposition in the suit, which will mean answering direct questions about the day of the Capitol riot and facing the accusation he incited an insurrection – an accusation from Democrats that morphed into an impeachment vote which ultimately failed in the Senate.
Also on rt.com  Trump SUING ‘Big Tech giants’ Facebook, Google and Twitter Trump confirmed to O’Reilly that he would address the Capitol riot issue head-on and even get into the accusations of  “election fraud.”
“I love talking about the election fraud,”  he said.
Both Trump and O’Reilly described the legal battle ahead as a  “war.”
“Everything’s a war,”  Trump said.  “With me, life is a war.”
Facebook, Twitter, and Google, the former president added,  “may be in the process of destroying our nation.”
Trump announced the lawsuit against the Big Tech companies and their CEOs, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, from New Jersey on Wednesday. Funded by the conservative non-profit group America First Policy Institute, the lawsuit seeks an  “immediate halt”  to social media companies’ censoring of users and  “blacklisting”  them for political purposes, arguing this violates First Amendment rights.
Such companies, Trump argues, have become a  “de facto censorship arm”  of the government, being used not only to dispense its essential information, but also to decide which political messages were appropriate for users to express.
Also on rt.com  Satirical content creator censored by YouTube ‘in error’ weeks after criticizing YouTube censorship On the Capitol riot and his alleged role in it, Trump again denied inciting violence and said it would be an  “easy”  case to make when he is questioned under oath. His social media accounts were suspended following the riots, with the various platforms citing his alleged spread of misinformation and aggressive rhetoric as the reason for his banishment.
“In my opinion, that will be a case that will be easy, and I think we’re going to do very, very well,”  Trump said.  “There were a lot of reasons for people to be [at the Capitol and] it was unfairly covered by the press, but the report came out by Congress and it didn’t even mention my name, let alone anything else, so we’re in very good shape.”

103,217521,Mail Online,2016-09-01,"Six months after the January 6th MAGA riot on  Capitol  Hill, fencing remains up around the building, authorities are searching for 300 suspects from that day and a third of Republican candidates in next year's election are pushing the false claim  Donald Trump  won in 2020.
More than 500 people face charges stemming from the riot, when thousands of pro-Trump supporters stormed the building to disrupt the formal certification of  Joe Biden  's victory. Many blame Trump for ginning up his supporters with his unproven allegations of voter fraud.
The violence led to five deaths, a trail of destruction through the Capitol building, and a renewed sense of bipartisan loathing among lawmakers.
In the aftermath, the  FBI  is still seeking information on more than 300 people who were among those in the Capitol hallways that day. That includes a $100,000 reward for the person who planted two pipe bombs outside the offices of the Republican and Democratic national committees the night before the riot.
The Justice Department has estimated that about 800 individuals may have been involved in the Jan. 6 attack.

The Justice Department has estimated that about 800 individuals may have been involved in the Jan. 6 attack on Capitol Hill
The  FBI website  on the January 6th riot is filled with photos taken that day, many of which are zoomed in on the suspects still out there.
The law enforcement agency asks for information on those who 'made unlawful entry into the U.S. Capitol building,' damaged valuable historic property, and targeted law enforcement and journalists.
More than a dozen people have already pled guilty in connection with the riot.
Security fencing remains in place around the Capitol although it is expected to come down in the next few weeks.
Acting USCP Chief Yogananda Pittman noted her agency, in the days since the riot, have increasing training, recruitment and communication to adding two new wellness support dogs, Lila (above) and Filip
The National Guard troops, however, have gone home. But magnetometers remain outside the House floor after some Republican lawmakers admitted to carrying guns in the complex.
US Capitol Police, meanwhile, have increased their visibility with officers and canines conducting drills around the Capitol. 'This is part of our ongoing plan to increase the number of drills and exercises around campus,' USCP noted in a tweet.
Officers were overwhelmed by Trump supporters on January 6th. Many remain traumatized and morale is reported to be poor among the force. Two officers, Brian Sicknick and Howie Liebengood, died in the aftermath of the riot.
Capitol Police are also opening regional offices in Florida and California to deal with threats to members of Congress, acting USCP Chief Yogananda Pittman noted in  a statement  on the six month anniversary.
Threats against lawmakers have more than doubled so far this year compared with last year, USCP noted in May.
Pittman also outlined other actions the agency has taken in the past six months, from increasing training, recruitment and communication to adding two new wellness support dogs, Lila and Filip.
In response to the riot, USCP has asked for a $107 million increase in its 2022 budget compared with its fiscal year 2021 budget. That matter is still being debated among lawmakers.
Partisan rancor remains high inside the marble walls of the Capitol complex with lawmakers unable to agree on a number of issues, including  a bipartisan commission to investigate what happened on January 6.
So House Democrats, last week, approved a special committee to probe what happened that day, including the causes and the effects.

Meanwhile, a new crop of Republican candidates for House and Senate contain a number of contenders who are pushing false claims about the 2020 election.
Of the nearly 700 Republicans who have filed the initial paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for Congress year, at least a third have embraced Trump's false claims that the election was stolen from him, according to an analysis by  The Washington Post  .
Many of those GOP candidates - 136 - are sitting members of Congress who voted against Biden’s electoral college victory on Jan. 6.
That includes Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican who has been a steadfast voice for Trump on Capitol Hill and a thorn in the side of Democrats.
Greene has antagonized Democrat lawmakers to the point about 40 of them wrote to House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy last week and asked him to do something about her. Greene already has lost her committee assignments for her past racist comments and sharing of QAnon conspiracy theories.
She and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, in particular, have argued in the hallways of Congress and on the House floor. After a May confrontation on the House floor, where Greene verbally confronted Ocasio-Cortez and then followed her out to the hallway to continue yelling, the New York Democrat considered getting a restraining order against Greene.
Democrats also moved Rep. Cori Bush's office away from Greene after the two lawmakers had a run-in in the hallway over mask wearing. Greene also trolled her office neighbor, Rep. Marie Newman, with an anti-trans sign after Newman, whose daughter is transgender, displayed a trans flag in the hallway.
Greene claims to be the victim of a 'witch hunt' and said she has done 'nothing wrong.'
Meanwhile, Trump is mulling another presidential bid in 2024. He has returned to the campaign stage with a series of 'revenge rallies,' targeting Republicans who called him out for not doing enough to stop his supporters on January 6th.
He continues to press the false claim he won in 2020.
'We won the election twice,' Trump said a crowd in Ohio at the end of June. 'And it's possible we'll have to win it a third time!'
Trump was stumping for his former aide Max Miller, who is running to unseat Republican Rep. Anthony Gonzalez in Ohio's 16th Congressional district.
Gonzalez was one of 10 House  Republicans  who voted to impeach the ex-president for inciting the January 6 insurrection on  Capitol  Hill."
104,217522,The Independent,2016-09-01,"Pro-  Trump  supporters have organised a rally in Florida this weekend at the state’s Capitol building, calling for the release of “political prisoners” who have been arrested in connection with the 6 January Capitol riots.
The “free our patriots” rally has been organised by a  Republican  candidate challenging  Marco Rubio  for  Senate  and is billed as a “peaceful demonstration” against the “corrupt federal government”.
According to a press release  , protesters are planning to gather on 10 July at 1pm at the Florida Capitol Building in Tallahassee.
Demonstrators will be “demanding the release of all the patriots being held as political prisoners by the corrupt federal government in relation to 6 January”.
On 6 January, pro-Trump rioters stormed the US Capitol in Washington in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election result following a Save America rally hosted by former President Donald Trump.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has  arrested 500 people in connection to the riots  , with attendees charged on a variety of counts including vandalisation, obstruction of proceedings and assault of police officers.
The sunshine state has seen a  disproportionate amount of residents  arrested in connection to the day, being tied with Texas for the most arrests following the riots at 47 individuals, a USA Today database  showed.
More than 40 per cent of the members of right-wing militia group the Oath Keepers and a quarter of the Proud Boys arrested over the riots are also from Florida, the database also revealed.
The “free our patriots” release, which refers to Mr Trump as the “legitimate president”, says attendees will be campaigning for the exoneration of “political prisoners” arrested in connection with the 6 January.
Five people died following the violence at the Capitol, including one Capitol police officer. Violent footage released by the FBI has revealed the brutal assaults on officers by some Trump supporters.
The release emphasised that the event will be a “peaceful demonstration” to petition “our great governor Ron DeSantis to demand the immediate release of the incarcerated patriots”.
“We are sure that once Gov DeSantis takes the lead, other patriots elected officials throughout the country will make the same push and then Washington will have no choice but to bend,” the release says.
The former president has baselessly maintained that the 2020 election was “stolen” from him without evidence and the “free our patriots” release pushed similar inaccurate sentiments.
The demonstration is being organised by the team of Luis Miguel for Senate, a candidate challenging Marco Rubio in the GOP primary for the 2022 race.
“Folks, the patriots who have been hunted down by the corrupt, communist FBI are suffering. Many of them are veterans who fought for this nation,” Mr Miguel  said in a post on Twitter.
He added: “Let’s do our part to ensure they’re liberated. We can’t allow this in America. Be there at the Florida Capitol 10 July.”
The rally comes not long after Mr Trump held a  rally in the state on Saturday  during which he reiterated false voter fraud claims and suggested Joe Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 presidential election.
The former president also said on Wednesday that he thinks those arrested in connection to the riots are being “treated unfairly” during an announcement that  he will sue Big Tech,  including Twitter and Facebook, for banning him from their platforms for “inciting violence” amid the riots."
105,217523,The Verge,2016-09-01,"Some 49 people accused of taking part in the January 6th riot at the US Capitol building have tried to erase images, videos, and texts from their phones and social media accounts, the Associated Press reported, citing a review of court records. Authorities told the AP that the people may have realized that the many photos and videos posted to social media by people participating in the riot could be used as evidence against them.
The AP cited several cases where accused rioters social media posts apparently contradicted what they told authorities about their involvement in the attack.
Hundreds of supporters of former President Trump stormed the Capitol building on January 6th as members of Congress prepared to certify the results of the presidential election. More than 500 people have been arrested in connection with the riot, Attorney General Merrick Garland said last month.
In the days following the attack, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), asked mobile carriers and social media platforms to preserve content and associated metadata that may have been connected to the attack.
The Washington Post reported Saturday that the Department of Justice has started arresting people who attacked reporters documenting the riot, damaging their equipment. The Post reports that the people would be charged with committing violence or destroying property on the grounds of the Capitol."
106,217524,Newsweek,2016-09-01,"Democratic President  Joe Biden  issued a statement on the six-month anniversary of the January 6 Capitol riots. In the statement, he called the riots ""a sad reminder that there is nothing guaranteed about our democracy,"" though he added that ""democracy did prevail"" after the riots.
""[The insurrectionists] launched a violent and deadly assault on the people's house, on the people's representatives, and on the Capitol police sworn to protect them, as our duly elected  Congress  carried out the sacred ritual of our republic and certified the Electoral College vote,"" Biden wrote.
""While it shocked and saddened the nation and the world,"" he continued, ""six months later, we can say unequivocally that democracy did prevail—and that we must all continue the work to protect and preserve it.""
He said remaining vigilant against such attacks on democracy requires ""people of goodwill and courage to stand up to the hate, the lies, and the extremism that led to this vicious attack, including determining what happened so that we can remember it and not bury it hoping we forget.""
The closing comment may allude to  congressional Republican opposition to creating a commission  meant to study the riot and how it unfolded.
Biden closed his statement by saying that the citizens of the U.S. had since proven that ""democracy can deliver"" by overcoming COVID-19 and restarting the economy. He also said that he and his wife continue to pray for Capitol Police officers killed or injured during the insurrection.
In January, the House  impeached then-President Donald Trump  for inciting the riots. Numerous people arrested for allegedly participating in the riots have since said that they invaded the Capitol because  they believed Trump's baseless claims  that the election had been ""stolen"" by an unprecedented nationwide conspiracy of widespread voter fraud.
Despite Biden's claim that ""democracy did prevail,"" most  Republicans  continue to blame  Democrats  for causing the riots.
Polls have shown that  75 percent of Republicans believe  Trump's baseless claim that Biden only won due to widespread voter fraud. Another poll showed that  45 percent of Republican voters supported the rioters  . Some Republican Congress members have also complained that arrested rioters  are being punished too harshly  .
A more recent poll found that  41 percent of Republican voters blame Biden  for causing the riots, and 52 percent blame congressional Democrats. An earlier poll found that 56 percent of Republicans thought  Trump did ""everything he could"" to stop the insurrection  .
Hours before the insurrection, Trump led a ""Stop the Steal"" rally saying that fraud on such a grand scale had never before stolen a U.S. election from voters before. About 60 election fraud lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign and Republican officials were dismissed from courts due to lack of evidence.
Also marking the riots' six-month anniversary, on Tuesday,  the FBI released 11 new videos  showing suspects allegedly committing assaults against law enforcement officers during the attempted insurrection.
The  FBI  said that it hoped that people would help identify the men in the videos so they could locate and arrest them. As of July 6, the FBI has arrested over 500 suspected rioters. More than 100 were arrested for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers."

108,217526,Mail Online,2016-09-01,"The US Capitol Dome is seen through post-riot security fencing on July 6, 2021 in Washington, DC
Six months after the insurrection at the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump, President Joe Biden called on Congress to investigate the assault, calling it an ""existential crisis"" for democracy.
""Not even during the Civil War did insurrectionists breach our Capitol, the citadel of our democracy,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But six months ago today, insurrectionists did.""
""This was not dissent. It was disorder. It posed an existential crisis and a test of whether our democracy could survive - a sad reminder that there is nothing guaranteed about our democracy,"" Biden said of the January 6 attack, meant to disrupt a session of Congress called to certify Biden's election win over then president Trump.
Biden called on ""people of goodwill and courage"" to investigate the riot and its origins and urged Democrats, Republicans and independents to work together.
House speaker Nancy Pelosi last month announced a special commission to investigate the Capitol assault, after a proposal to create an independent investigative committee -- resembling the 9/11 commission -- was blocked by Senate Republicans, who said existing congressional and law enforcement investigations were sufficient.
The new special commission, which will aim to centralize those multiple congressional committees, will have the power to summon witnesses and documents, but it risks being seen as partisan.
Trump gave a speech to supporters gathered for a rally outside the White House January 6, before much of the crowd marched to the Capitol and broke into the building during the session to certify Biden as president.
Trump had repeatedly and falsely claimed the election was marred by fraud and that victory was stolen from him.
The assault was stunningly violent and chaotic and left five people dead, including a Capitol police officer.
The House of Representatives impeached Trump for an unprecedented second time over the riot, saying he instigated it but the Senate acquitted him."
109,217527,@YahooNews,2016-09-01,"T  he Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021, began as Congress was certifying now-President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory over former President Donald Trump and descended into chaos following a speech outside from Trump himself. The events of the day sparked Trump's second impeachment and subsequent acquittal.
Six months on, a number of key questions remain.
Pipe bomb suspect still at-large
The suspect who planted pipe bombs the night before outside the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees in Washington remains unknown and at large. One pipe bomb was placed in an alley behind the RNC, while the other was placed next to a park bench near the DNC.
FBI Director Christopher Wray  testified  before the House in June, saying, “We are aggressively investigating. ... That’s one of the investigations that we’re particularly concerned about.”
Video footage released by the FBI shows the suspect wearing a gray hoodie, a face mask, black and light gray Nike Air Max Speed Turf shoes with a yellow logo, and carrying a bag while strolling through the Capitol Hill neighborhood between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 5.
The FBI said it  released the footage  in the hopes that someone could identify the person’s gait, body language, or mannerisms. The FBI also put out a  $50,000  reward for information leading to the identification or arrest of the pipe bomb suspect in January, and that reward was increased to  $75,000  then to  $100,000  .
The FBI said the components of the devices include 1-by-8-inch threaded galvanized pipes, a kitchen timer, and homemade black powder. Steven D’Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the Washington field office,  said  in March that “these pipe bombs were viable devices that could have been detonated, resulting in serious injury or death.”
It has been widely speculated, although not proven, that the pipe bombs were planted the night before to distract from the Capitol riot the next day.
Former U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund testified: “We were dealing with two pipe bombs that were specifically set right off the edge of our perimeter to, what I suspect, draw resources away.”
Capitol Police Inspector General Michael Bolton  told  the House in May: “If those pipe bombs were intended to be a diversion, it worked.”
The shooting of Ashli Babbitt
A number of Republican lawmakers, as well as Trump, have begun to call for the release of the identity of the Capitol Police officer who  shot and killed  Ashli Babbitt during the riot, joining her family in claiming that the fatal shooting of the 35-year-old Air Force veteran and Trump supporter was unjustified.
The Justice Department  said  in April that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, and the Metropolitan Police Department’s Internal Affairs Division “conducted a thorough investigation.” The officials “determined that there is insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution.”
Trump  asked  who was responsible for Babbitt’s death in an early July email statement and brought it up again during a rally in Florida on Saturday, telling the crowd, “Who shot Ashli Babbitt? We all saw the hand. We saw the gun. ... Now, they don’t want to give the name. … It’s got to be released.”
Dr. Francisco Diaz, the chief medical examiner for the District of Columbia,  determined  in April that Babbitt’s death was caused by a “gunshot wound to the left anterior shoulder.” A video shows Babbitt attempting to climb through a window into the Speaker's Lobby when she was  shot and killed  by the yet-unidentified officer.
The DOJ said that “the focus of the criminal investigation” related to Babbitt’s shooting “was to determine whether federal prosecutors could prove that the officer violated any federal laws” and concentrated on a  federal criminal statute  governing the potential deprivation of civil rights.
DOJ said the investigation “revealed no evidence to establish that, at the time the officer fired a single shot at Ms. Babbitt, the officer did not reasonably believe that it was necessary to do so in self-defense or in defense of the Members of Congress and others evacuating the House Chamber,” and so “acknowledging the tragic loss of life and offering condolences to Ms. Babbitt’s family, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and U.S. Department of Justice have therefore closed the investigation.”
The Justice Department argued its investigation “determined that Ms. Babbitt was among a mob of people that entered the Capitol building and gained access to a hallway outside Speaker’s Lobby."" Police ""positioned themselves between the doors and the mob,” while “members of the mob attempted to break through the doors by striking them and breaking the glass with their hands, flagpoles, helmets, and other objects.”
A video shows the Capitol Police officer wearing a face mask and with his gun drawn inside the Speaker’s Lobby as Babbitt, wearing a Trump flag like a cape, attempted to clamber through the broken door. It was then that the Justice Department says the officer “fired one round from his service pistol, striking Ms. Babbitt in the left shoulder, causing her to fall back from the doorway and onto the floor.""
John Sullivan, a  self-styled leftist activist  who has since been indicted on a host of crimes, shot a graphic video of Babbitt’s death inside the Capitol.
Mark Schamel, an attorney for the officer who shot Babbitt,  said  in February, ""There’s no way to look at the evidence and think he’s anything but a hero.”
""It’s a false narrative that he issued no verbal commands or warnings,” Schamel  told  reporters. ""He was screaming, ‘Stay back! Stay back! Don’t come in here!’”
""There should be a training video on how he handled that situation. What he did was unbelievable heroism,"" the lawyer said, claiming that the officer ""stopped a potential massacre.""
Terrell Roberts, an attorney representing Babbitt’s family, rejected the Justice Department’s decision in a statement to the Washington Examiner.
""The actual evidence is this: The officer shot an unarmed woman who was not an immediate threat to him or any Member of Congress. That is inconsistent with any claim of self-defense or the defense of others, period,"" he said, adding, ""We strongly disagree with the U.S. Attorney’s decision. But we are not dissuaded from our goal of ultimately vindicating Ashli Babbitt’s constitutional rights in the civil arena.""
Days after the DOJ decision was made, Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, filed a  request  for documents from the Washington, D.C., police department under the Freedom of Information Act. Her family also plans to  file a lawsuit  against the Capitol Police and the officer for at least $10 million.
Continued Democratic claims about Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick
Prominent Democrats, including Biden, continue to suggest that Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died as a result of the violence at the Capitol despite the medical examiner’s office in Washington  concluding  that his death was natural.
Sicknick, 42, died on Jan. 7, one day after the riot.
Biden mischaracterized the death of Sicknick in June, claiming Sicknick was killed by ""criminals.”
The chief medical examiner’s office told the Washington Examiner in April that Sicknick’s “cause of death” was “acute brainstem and cerebellar infarcts due to acute basilar artery thrombosis,"" a stroke, and the “manner of death” was “natural.” The medical examiner said Sicknick was sprayed with a chemical substance at about 2:20 p.m. on Jan. 6, collapsed at the Capitol at about 10 p.m., and was transported by emergency services to a local hospital. He died at about 9:30 p.m. on Jan. 7. Francisco Diaz, the chief medical examiner,  told the  Washington Post that Sicknick died after suffering two strokes, did not suffer an allergic reaction to chemical irritants, and bore no evidence of either external or internal injuries, but he contended that “all that transpired played a role in his condition.“
The medical examiner’s office noted that the term “natural” is “used when a disease alone causes death.""
In its initial statement on Sicknick, the Capitol Police said he ""was injured while physically engaging with protesters"" and that he ""was taken to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.”
White House press secretary  Jen Psaki  falsely claimed in May that there were “a number of officers” who died on the day of the Capitol riot. In the days following the riot, Metropolitan Police Officer  Jeffrey Smith  and Capitol Police Officer  Howard Liebengood  both died by suicide.
The New York Times reported on Jan. 8, citing ""two law enforcement officials,"" that Sicknick was beaten with a fire extinguisher and died hours later. In February, the outlet  updated  its report, but a Democratic  pretrial impeachment memo  had already cited the reporting.
Julian Khater and George Tanios were  charged  in March with coordinating to assault Sicknick and two other officers with a chemical spray, but the men were not accused of killing Sicknick, and no one has been charged in connection with his death.
A bipartisan Senate  report  on the Capitol riot released in June also contended that seven individuals, including three  police officers  , “ultimately lost their lives” as a result of the Capitol siege.
Future investigations — Congress, sedition, and Trump
Questions also remain about the future of the investigations related to the Capitol riot, especially following  speculation  from Justice Department officials about sedition charges that have not emerged and after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi launched a select committee stacked with staunch Trump critics.
The Democratic-led House  voted  in late June to create a select committee to investigate the attack on the Capitol after Senate Republicans used the filibuster to reject an earlier attempt at an independent commission. The proposal allows Pelosi to appoint 13 members, with five appointed after “consultation” with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.
The committee will be  tasked  with reporting on the “facts, circumstances, and causes relating to the Jan. 6, 2021, domestic terrorist attack,” including “the influencing factors that fomented such an attack.” The committee's leader will be authorized to issue subpoenas without input from the Republican minority.
Pelosi  announced  her picks for the committee, including controversial Trump critic Adam Schiff and GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, who voted to impeach Trump this year. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, was also  picked  for the committee. Thompson filed a  lawsuit  in February against Trump, former Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, the Proud Boys, and the Oath Keepers, reaching the conclusion that the four “conspired to incite an assembled crowd to march upon and enter the Capitol of the United States for the common purpose of disrupting, by the use of force, intimidation and threat, the approval by Congress of the count of votes cast by members of the Electoral College.”
With the 2022 midterm elections already looming, it remains to be seen how long the committee’s work will last, whether McCarthy will select Republicans to join, whether Pelosi will accept his picks, and whether the committee will attempt to subpoena GOP lawmakers, former Trump officials, or Trump himself.
Michael Sherwin, the former acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia,  told  60 Minutes in March that authorities were investigating Trump’s potential criminal liability and that he also believed the evidence existed to file  sedition charges  against some of those involved in the Capitol riot, both things he had been hinting at since January.
“It's unequivocal that Trump was the magnet that brought the people to D.C. on the 6th,” Sherwin said. “Now the question is, is he criminally culpable for everything that happened during the siege, during the breach?”
Sherwin, who headed off to the U.S. attorney’s office in Miami, was also asked about possible sedition charges. He responded, “I believe the facts do support those charges, and I think that, as we go forward, more facts will support that.”
U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta criticized the Justice Department in a rare rebuke after DOJ officials speculated in the media about  possible sedition charges  against members of the Oath Keepers, saying he was “surprised” to see Sherwin and other officials discussing the pending investigation in interviews.
“I was surprised — and I’m being restrained in my use of terminology — surprised, to say the least, to see Mr. Sherwin sitting for an interview about a pending case in an ongoing criminal investigation,” the judge said, adding, “As for the New York Times  story  , I found it troubling that sources within the Department of Justice were detailing the possibility of additional charges in a pending criminal case.”
The judge said he is committed to trying defendants based on the facts of a case rather than speculation.
More than 500 charges — what's next?
The Justice Department has arrested more than 500 individuals in connection to the riot. But the question of what happens next remains open as a trickle of defendants plead guilty and potential trials loom and as a number of Republicans and Democrats have raised concerns about the prison conditions for the accused.
“How come so many people are still in jail over Jan. 6th when nobody paid a price for the fire and carnage and death that took place in Democrat-run cities throughout our country, including antifa and BLM?” Trump asked during his recent Florida rally. “How come? And why are our Republican leaders like McConnell afraid to take up the subject and talk about it?”
Last month, Attorney General Merrick Garland  compared  the Capitol riot to the Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people, and Wray said that nothing, including Jan. 6,  could be compared  to the ""horror"" of 9/11. Garland  indicated  in May that the Justice Department was prioritizing prosecutions related to the siege of the Capitol over those tied to last year’s riots because the events of Jan. 6 were “the most dangerous threat to our democracy.”
The Department of Justice  investigation  has often focused on actions taken by members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, many of whom it has hit with conspiracy charges. A few  guilty pleas  occurred  last month.
Garland  said  in late June that the DOJ had “crossed the threshold of 500 arrests.” The Justice Department said Tuesday that it had charged at least 165 people with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees and contended that approximately 140 police officers were assaulted on Jan. 6.
Jail officials in the district decided that the Capitol riot detainees should be held in “restrictive housing” as a safety measure for the accused, and some defendants found themselves in solitary confinement 23 hours a day before their trials have begun. Such measures have been criticized by both sides of the aisle.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat,  said  in April that “solitary confinement is a form of punishment that is cruel and psychologically damaging … and we’re talking about people who haven’t been convicted of anything yet.” Warren said she was worried that law enforcement officers were trying to “punish” the rioters or to “break them so that they will cooperate.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said, ""Nobody should be detained indefinitely in America for domestic law purposes.” Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, agreed, saying, “I think the standard for justice should be the same for everyone.""
Republican senators  demanded  a host of answers from Garland in June about the DOJ’s alleged ""unequal justice"" in its handling of the violent protests in 2020 versus the Capitol riot in January.
“We join all Americans in the expectation that the DOJ’s response to the events of Jan. 6 will result in rightful criminal prosecutions and accountability,” the GOP senators  said  , adding, “DOJ’s apparent unwillingness to punish these individuals who allegedly committed crimes during the spring and summer 2020 protests stands in stark contrast to the harsher treatment of the individuals charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol.”
Sherwin  vowed  in January that “regardless of if it was just a trespass in the Capitol or if someone planted a pipe bomb, you will be charged, and you will be found.”
Capitol Police general counsel Thomas DiBiase  said  in March that the department had provided more than 14,000 hours of surveillance camera footage to congressional investigators, the FBI, and the Metropolitan Police, with defendants and media outlets seeking  access  to the footage too.

110,217528,Newsweek,2016-09-01,"Many claimed to have seen the ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" actor taking part in the insurrection on January 6 with some photographs of a man looking like him doing the rounds on social media."
111,217529,The Washington Times,2016-09-01,"Republicans in Florida, the state with the most residents to face charges for the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, plan to rally Saturday for the release of all defendants currently held on related counts.
Luis Miguel  , a self-described “pro-Trump patriot” planning to primary Sen. Marco Rubio, said his “Free Our Patriots Rally in Tally” will happen in the afternoon near the Florida state Capitol in Tallahassee.
“The patriots who have been hunted down by the corrupt, communist FBI are suffering. Many of them are veterans who fought for this nation. Let’s do our part to ensure they’re liberated,” said Mr.  Miguel  .
Calling the accused rioters “peaceful protesters” currently being held as “political prisoners by the U.S. government,” Mr.  Miguel  said rallygoers will urge elected officials to “fight for their release.”
Jeremy Liggett, who is currently running to represent the state’s 7th Congressional District, said he will speak at the event; Christine Quinn, a twice-failed former House hopeful, said she will attend.
Six months after the U.S. Capitol was stormed by supporters of then-President Trump, the Department of Justice said Tuesday that over 535 people have been arrested on related charges nationwide.
Florida is home to more than 50 of the defendants, or roughly one in 10 of the several hundred charged in federal court, making it the U.S. state with the most residents to be arrested over the riot.
At least 55 of the hundreds of defendants, 11%, served or were serving in the U.S. military, including at least one in active duty, according to the George Washington University’s Program on Extremism.
The riot at the Capitol occurred as Congress met inside to certify the results of the 2020 election and effectively clear the path for President Biden to succeed Mr. Trump and be sworn in two weeks later.
In addition to briefly delaying the democratic process, the rioters caused extensive property damage and injuries to numerous police officers attempting to defend the building. One rioter was shot and killed by an officer defending the building.
Floridians charged over the riot face various counts ranging from conspiracy and assault on a federal officer, to civil disorder, violent entry and obstruction of an official proceeding, among others.
A number of Republicans have sought to downplay the riot in the six months since it occurred. Democratic leadership recently established a select committee to investigate the attack, despite GOP opposition.
Mr.  Miguel  styles himself as a “dark horse” candidate not unlike Mr. Trump. “He will take up the Trump banner and make America First his hill to die on,” the Senate hopeful declares on his website.
“The GOP establishment has turned a blind eye to the political prisoners, but insurgent patriot candidates haven’t,” Mr.  Miguel  said on Twitter earlier this week.
It was not clear what size crowd the weekend rally might attract. Mr.  Miguel  had attempted to promote it on Facebook, but two different “event” pages  he  created were later removed from the social network.
Facebook did not immediately respond to a message inquiring about the scrubbed event pages.

112,217530,Mail Online,2016-09-01,"Former President  Donald Trump  called the January 6  Capitol  attack an 'unfortunate event' during a press conference Wednesday at his Bedminster resort.
He went on to complain about the 'unfair' treatment his supporters have received while 'nothing happens' to Antifa or the Capitol Police officer who killed Ashli Babbitt, the 35-year-old Trump supporter who was shot trying to enter the Speaker's Lobby during the insurrection attempt.
'He would be the most well known person in this country, in the world. The person that shot Ashli Babbitt, boom, right through the head, just boom,' Trump said. 'There was no reason for that.'
Former President Donald Trump said Wednesday at a press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey that the January 6 Capitol attack was an 'unfortunate event'
Trump also claimed that a Senate report on the January 6 attack (pictured), which was carried out by his supporters, didn't name him and let him off the hook for blame
Trump complained that the officer who killed Ashli Babbitt (pictured) hasn't been publicly named. Babbitt was shot on January 6 as she tried to get into the Speaker's Lobby
Trump hosted reporters and supporters to an outdoor press event Wednesday to announce that he was headlining a class action lawsuit against Facebook, Twitter and other 'Big Tech' companies, blasting them for stifling conservative viewpoints.
Trump got banished from Twitter and Facebook for his actions on January 6.
The then-president didn't condemn his supporters' actions as they broke into the U.S. Capitol Buildling as Congress was trying to certify the election of now-President Joe Biden.
During a brief Q&A session, Trump was asked what he had done to halt the insurrection - and why he wasn't able to stop it.
Trump answered by pointing to a report, likely the bipartisan Senate report, '  Examining the Capitol Attack  ,' which he claimed let him off the hook for any blame.
'I was surprised, frankly, because I would have assumed that they would have come up with a typically biased, at least on the Democrat side, statement. But the report came out a few weeks ago my name wasn't even mentioned,' Trump said.
Trump's named in the report 44 times, but the Senate Homeland Security Committee and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration didn't delve into the root causes of the attack.
Those areas will likely be explored by the select committee assembled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the wake Senate Republicans filibustering a bill that would have created a bipartisan 9/11-style commission to investigate the 1/6 attack.
'It was an unfortunate event,' Trump said of January 6 at his press conference Wednesday.
'I say though, however, our people are being treated unbelievably unfairly,' Trump continued. 'When you look at people in prison, and nothing happens to Antifa and they burned down cities and killed people.'
-

'There were no guns in the Capitol,' the ex-president added. 'Except for the gun that shot Ashli Babbitt. And nobody knows who that man [was].'
The police lieutenant who shot Babbitt hasn't been publicly named.
'If that were the opposite way that man would be all over, he would be the most well known, and I believe I can say a thing because I believe I know exactly who it is,' Trump continued.
The Department of Justice said after a three-month-long investigation into the shooting that it would not bring criminal charges against the officer for fatally shooting Babbitt.
Trump suggested this wasn't enough.
'And why isn't that person being opened up and why isn't that being studied? They've already written it off, they said that case is closed,' he said.
'If that were the opposite, that case would be going on for years and years and it would not be pretty,' he continued. 'So I just thought this was a very important time,' he added, seguing back to why he was suing Facebook and Twitter."
113,217531,CNN,2016-09-01,"(CNN)The Justice Department unveiled a major indictment Thursday against five Floridians accused of attacking at least seven police officers during the US Capitol insurrection.
Prosecutors say the defendants, all from the Tampa Bay area, repeatedly attacked members of Washington, DC's police force. They allegedly used stolen riot shields and flagpoles to assault officers in the head and neck, and later resorted to punching, kicking, and elbowing the officers.
The indictment includes 19 criminal counts, which is among the most for a Capitol riot case.
Four of the defendants were arrested last week, and they pleaded not guilty Thursday in DC federal court. Three were released and a fourth is in jail while a judge considers a request from prosecutors to keep him detained before trial. The fifth defendant hasn't been located and ""remains at large,"" the Justice Department said in a press release.
Prosecutors say Jonathan Pollock charged at police with a flagpole, dragged two officers down a set of stairs, kneed a police officer, punched two officers in the face, grabbed at one officer's neck and pinned them to the ground, and rammed a stolen police shield into an officer's throat.
He wore tactical gear and a military outfit and was at the Capitol with his sister, Olivia Pollock. Prosecutors say she elbowed a police officer and repeatedly tried to rip away officers' batons.
The charging documents say that Michael Perkins threw a flagpole at the police line, and later ""thrust[ed] the flagpole into the chest of a police officer."" After that happened, Perkins allegedly raised the flagpole over his head and swung it at an officer, either hitting their head or back.
Prosecutors say Joseph Hutchinson helped breach a fence and kicked officers that were trying to prevent rioters from further breaching the Capitol. Hutchinson was also wearing tactical gear.
This was ""a coordinated group of individuals who stuck with each other and facilitated each other's assaults,"" federal prosecutor Benet Kearney said Thursday at a court hearing.
A fifth man, Joshua Doolin, was charged with the group but isn't accused of assaulting anyone. Prosecutors said he was spotted near the Capitol carrying ""zip tie handcuffs tucked in his belt"" and that he had a canister of chemical irritants that ""appear to belong"" to police, for use in riot control situations. Prosecutors didn't say how Doolin obtained the canister or the handcuffs.
The case highlights the violence that police faced at the hands of the pro-Trump mob, which many officers have described as a harrowing life-or-death experience. Nonetheless, many of former President Donald Trump's allies have whitewashed the events of January 6, downplayed the violence, and claimed that the crowd basically resembled a routine tourist visit at the Capitol.
Nearly 530 people have been charged with crimes stemming from the Capitol attack. All five defendants in this case hail from Florida, which has the most defendants of any state in the country, with 62 in total. The states with the next-most defendants are Pennsylvania and Texas.
Doolin, Hutchinson and Olivia Pollock pleaded not guilty at a court hearing Thursday. All three are out of jail -- Hutchinson is on home detention, the other two are getting GPS monitoring. Perkins is still in jail, and prosecutors say he is too dangerous to release. A judge will decide next week whether to keep him detained. He pleaded not guilty.
Authorities still haven't located Jonathan Pollack.
This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.

114,217532,@YahooNews,2016-09-01,"A new video from inside the  US Capitol  during 6 January insurrection appears to show police officers confronted with strobe lights by members of a “  MAGA  ” mob.
In a clip tweeted out by NBC Washington’s  Scott MacFarlane  on Monday, strobe lights could be seen flashing in the face of  Capitol police  officers confronted by a small crowd of rioters.
Strobe lights are a form of non-lethal weapon thought to be maintained by the US military and law enforcement agencies, and are designed to disorientate targets through the flashing of a bright light and different frequencies.
Members appeared to be armed with the flashing lights when they stormed the Capitol building in support of Donald Trump, and false allegations of electoral fraud on 6 January as Congress was certifying the victory of Joe Biden, according to the video released on Monday.
Mr MacFarlane wrote in a caption to the 36-second clip: “Newly released court exhibit video in Jan 6 case shows the claustrophobic conditions and the disorienting strobe light on the frontlines for police amid the mob“.
“This was hell,” he added.
More than 50 former and active members of the military, law enforcement and US government workers were among the 500 so far arrested for storming the Capitol.
It includes the arrest of a rioter who was seen in the chamber of the US Senate with black tactical gear and plastic restraints. Officers afterwards  found 15 firearms  stashed away by the accused.
Strobe lights, according to a tests carried out in 2008 and reported by  Wired  ,  were created for US law enforcement agencies and were found to disorientate and delay targets, amid other unconfirmed symptoms.

115,217533,The Sun,2016-09-01,"NANCY Pelosi trolled Trump on Thursday by calling him a “twice-impeached Florida retiree” and “de-facto leader of the GOP.”
She also claimed that  Trump  and other Republicans “stand with traitors” and “not with our law enforcement.”
The Speaker  was reacting to  Trump’s announcement on Wednesday  that he will file a class-action lawsuit against Facebook, Twitter, and Google - and their CEOs.
Trump received a permanent suspension from his favored social media platform Twitter earlier this year after the Capitol was stormed by his supporters.
He also has a two-year suspension from Facebook and was hit with bans from Snapchat and YouTube, among others, this year.
The former president announced he was suing the companies this week as he claimed conservatives are being “censored.”
The ex-president was questioned at the briefing about the reasons why he personally received a ban from the platforms after the violence of the Capitol riot on January 6.
He claimed that many involved in the riot were unfairly treated as he spoke about the cop who killed rioter  Ashli Babbitt  not facing any charges.
""The report came out two weeks ago, my name wasn't even mentioned,"" Trump said about a recent briefing to Congress of the events of January 6.
""It was an unfortunate event,"" he added.
""However, people are being treated unbelievably unfairly when you see people are in prison and nothing happens to Antifa and they burned down cities and killed people.
""There were no guns in the Capitol apart from the gun that shot Ashli Babbitt,"" he continued, as he called for the cop involved to be named.
""And nobody knows who that man was.
""If that was the other way around that man would be all over.""
Pelosi hit out at Trump’s comments alleging it shows he does not support law enforcement as he claims to do.
“Twice-impeached Florida retiree – and de facto leader of the Republican Party – Donald Trump joined House Republicans today in disrespecting the Capitol Police and other law enforcement officers, who valiantly defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, decrying how rioters “are being treated unbelievably unfairly” now that they are facing legal consequences for their actions,” she  said in a statement.
“Like Donald, House Republicans have shown time and time again that they stand with traitors – not with our law enforcement.”
Trump was impeached but cleared for the second time on charges that he incited the riot on January 6 through his comments at a rally earlier that day.
He has denied that he was responsible for his supporters storming Capitol buildings.
Some Republicans have also now denied that the events of January 6 were violent as they voted against honoring the police officers who protected the building.
Pelosi had originally been pushing for a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the riot but it was shot down by the Senate GOP.
She has now  launched a Democrat-led commission  to carry out a probe.
Republicans have branded  Pelosi’s latest scheme  a “turbo-charged partisan exercise” instead of an “honest fact-finding body.”
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy had even threatened to strip Republicans of committee assignments if they accept the appointment to join the committee, an aide said.
Trump continued to rage against social media platforms on Thursday in an op-ed with the  Wall Street Journal  .

“One of the gravest threats to our democracy today is a powerful group of Big Tech corporations that have teamed up with the government to censor the free speech of the American people,” he wrote.
“ This is not only wrong—it is unconstitutional.
“To restore free speech for myself and for every American, I am suing Big Tech to stop it.”"
116,217534,RT International,2016-09-01,"The Capitol Hill press corps found little sympathy on social media after Vice News posted an article saying that some journalists remain so traumatized by the January 6 riot that they’re undergoing therapy and struggling to sleep. In fact, Tuesday’s Vice article said, some of the reporters who  “survived”  the riot still won’t even go back into the Capitol to do their jobs, despite the fact they continue to cover Congress.  “One longtime Capitol Hill reporter opted for early retirement shortly after living through the riot,”  the media outlet said.
Read more Bloomberg News reporter Erik Wasson told Vice that he’s suffering from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and he fears that such an incident will happen again.  “It feels like one of those horror movies, like the end of ‘Jaws,’”  he said.  “Everything feels copacetic on the beach, but you wonder if there’s anything out there.”
The story’s underlying theme, of course, was the evil of Republicans. As shaken as he was by the scary sounds and scenes of the riot, one reporter was even more stunned by the fact that many House Republicans dared to vote against certifying President Joe Biden’s election victories in two states – even after the Capitol breach, as if the day’s events should have nullified their concerns over alleged fraud. Another said he won’t interview Senator Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) again because in light of the lawmaker’s challenging of Biden’s win,  “I don't give a f**k about what your thoughts are on tech s**t anymore.”  Still others are disgusted when they hear Republicans  “push lies”  that  “antifa”  (lowercase) or the FBI stirred the  “insurrection.”
Russiagate conspiracy theorist Brian Stelter, chief media critic at CNN, was so touched by Vice’s dramatic and harrowing tale that he wished he had thought to write it first. But other observers weren’t nearly as moved.

— Mike Glenn (@mrglenn)  July 6, 2021 Vice noted that Bloomberg’s Wasson had a gun pointed at him by a Cambodian soldier when he worked overseas,  “but this [the riot] was different.”
After the scary Capitol breach, Wasson researched riot-survival techniques, including how to use a metal pen as a weapon. He said he was more scared going back to the Capitol for Biden’s January 20 inauguration – despite the presence of 26,000 National Guard troops – than during the riot itself.
Media outlets have portrayed the riot as having killed five people, and initial reports by CNN and others falsely said that supporters of former President Donald Trump had bludgeoned a police officer to death. The officer, Brian Sicknick, died of natural causes, a long-delayed autopsy showed, and three of the people who died during the riot were Trump supporters who succumbed to medical conditions, including heart attack. The only person who was killed was Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by an unidentified police officer.

Some election-fraud protesters reportedly yelled and spat at reporters. Other alleged offenses included the tackling of a cameraman and taunting and pushing of a New York Times photographer.
Social media users argued that like the riot itself, the suffering of reporters is being overblown.  “The reporters who survived are struggling?”  one commenter tweeted.  “I wonder what correspondents from World War II would think.”

117,217535,The Independent,2016-09-01,"US House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi  ’s office has given a scathing public assessment of former President  Donald Trump  in an official statement following his expression of sympathy for Capitol rioters.
In a statement  attributed to the  Democratic  speaker’s press office on Thursday, Ms Pelosi chastised Mr Trump as a “twice-impeached  Florida  retiree” in her official capacity as speaker.
“Twice-impeached Florida retiree – and de facto leader of the Republican Party – Donald Trump joined House Republicans today in disrespecting the Capitol Police and other law enforcement officers,” Ms Pelosi’s office in the statement.
The statement noted that such officers “valiantly defended the US Capitol on January 6th” and condemned Mr Trump for appearing to defend suspected rioters “now that they are facing legal consequences for their actions”.
Mr Trump on Wednesday  said he believed that many of those facing charges for their alleged involvement in the 6 January insurrection “are being treated unbelievably unfairly”.
“When you look at people in prison and nothing happens to Antifa and they burned down cities and killed people,” the former president said.
Mr Trump became the first president to have been impeached twice during his time in office, with the second trial alleging he incited his supporters to march on the US Capitol on 6 January.
Since Mr Trump left office he has mostly been residing in his Mar-A-Lago club in Florida, with  reports claiming  he and his wife are leading an “old-fashioned club life” in the months since.
This week Mr Trump has once again stirred up controversy on Capitol Hill after he announced he would be  suing three of the country’s biggest tech companies.
The former president’s vendetta against Facebook, Twitter and Google’s YouTube comes after they banned him for “inciting violence” following the riots. Mr Trump has remained prohibited from the platforms.
The former president also made reference to the shooting of rioter and US Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, who some conservatives have come to paint as a patriotic martyr.
“But the person that shot Ashli Babbitt, boom, right through the head, just boom, there was no reason for that,” Mr Trump said.
He added: “And why isn’t that person being opened up, and why isn’t that being studied? They’ve already written it off. They said that case is closed.”
The former president’s reference to Ms Babbitt being shot “right through the head” is inaccurate. The Department of Justice (DOJ) found Babbitt had been shot in the left shoulder.
Ms Babbitt was part of the mob of pro-Trump rioters that stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election result following a Save America rally hosted by Mr Trump.
The DOJ  ruled  that Ms Babbitt had entered the Capitol with rioters and was forcing her way through a broken glass door near the Speaker’s Lobby, prompting an officer to fire a single round.
The US Attorney’s Office and DOJ closed the investigation into the matter in April, ruling they would not pursue criminal charges against the US Capitol Police officer who shot her.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has arrested 500 people in connection to the riots, with attendees charged on a variety of counts including vandalisation, obstruction of proceedings and assault of police officers.
Footage released by the FBI has shown the extent of the violent assaults on officers by some Trump supporters. Five people died as a result of the violence at the Capitol, including one Capitol police officer and Ms Babbitt."
118,217536,Business Insider,2016-09-01,"-  Adam Kinzinger told NYT Magazine that he suspects some Republicans knew what would happen on Jan. 6.
-  Kinzinger pointed to a tweet from Lauren Boebert on that day that said: ""Today is 1776.""
-  See more stories on Insider's business page  .

Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois in  a recent interview with New York Times Magazine  said he suspected some Republican lawmakers knew there would be an insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6.
""I won't name names, but yes, I do have that suspicion. I will say, if you just looked at Twitter — the whole reason I brought my gun and kept my staff home and told my wife to stay in the apartment was looking at Twitter. I saw the threats,"" Kinzinger said.
Kinzinger specifically called out GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado over a tweet she sent ahead of the fatal riot at the Capitol. On the morning of January 6, Boebert tweeted:  ""Today is 1776.""
""I don't know what that meant other than this is the time for revolution,"" Kinzinger said of Boebert's tweet. ""Maybe it was a dumb tweet that she didn't mean. Fine. I'll give her that credit for now. But if you have members of Congress who were involved in nurturing an insurrection, heck yeah, we need to know.""
The Illinois lawmaker was one of just 10 Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump for provoking the January 6 insurrection.
After weeks of attempting to overturn the 2020 election and spreading false claims about the result, Trump delivered an  incendiary, lie-filled speech  outside of the White House shortly before the riot began. During the speech, Trump reiterated baseless claims that he won the election and President Joe Biden had ""stolen""it from him. The insurrection delayed, but did not ultimately prevent, the certification of Biden's Electoral College victory.
Months after leaving office, and Trump has still not acknowledged that he was fairly defeated by Biden in 2020.
Numerous Republican lawmakers in Washington have amplified Trump's ""big lie"" while  attempting to rewrite the history of the Capitol attack,  which left five people dead. Republicans have also moved to block Democratic efforts to further investigate the events of January 6, while  ostracizing GOP lawmakers  who don't echo Trump's false claims about the election.
Tuesday marked six months since the deadly riot."

121,217539,TheHill,2016-09-01,"U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) will begin to remove the remaining fencing around the Capitol on Friday, deconstructing a controversial barrier put in place following the Jan. 6 riot.
“Based on the current threat environment, recent enhancements to USCP response capabilities, and enhanced coordination with local, state and federal law enforcement, the Capitol Police Board is supporting USCP’s recommendation to remove the temporary fencing around Capitol Square,” the USCP wrote in an email to lawmakers obtained by The Hill on Wednesday.
Capitol Police noted that the fencing could be down in two or three days, weather permitting.

The timing also falls after the Fourth of July, another date some feared could spur interest from those who have called for an insurrection.
The removal of the fencing would mark one of the last physical security measures to be lifted following the attack, though lawmakers are still required to go through metal detectors before going to vote, and the building remains closed to the general public.
The notice to staff warned that the fencing would return if Capitol Police believe there is a threat.
“Please note that the Architect of the Capitol has the ability to and will reinstall the temporary fencing should conditions warrant,” it said.
Though multiple lawmakers have called for a number of reforms within the Capitol Police, including increased protection from the force when in their districts, many complained the fencing was an eyesore that kept the public away from an unusually accessible government building.
